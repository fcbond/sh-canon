<p>
<span sid='37647' title='37647'>I don't think that any of my adventures with Mr Sherlock Holmes opened quite so abruptly, or so dramatically, as that which I associate with The Three Gables. </span>
<span sid='37648' title='37648'>I had not seen Holmes for some days, and had no idea of the new channel into which his activities had been directed. </span>
<span sid='37649' title='37649'>He was in a chatty mood that morning, however, and had just settled me into the well-worn low arm-chair on one side of the fire, while he had curled down with his pipe in his mouth upon the opposite chair, when our visitor arrived. </span>
<span sid='37650' title='37650'>If I had said that a mad bull had arrived, it would give a clearer impression of what occurred.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37651' title='37651'>The door had flown open and a huge negro had burst into the room. </span>
<span sid='37652' title='37652'>He would have been a comic figure if he had not been terrific, for he was dressed in a very loud grey check suit with a flowing salmon-coloured tie. </span>
<span sid='37653' title='37653'>His broad face and flattened nose were thrust forward, as his sullen dark eyes, with a smouldering gleam of malice in them, turned from one of us to the other.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37654' title='37654'>'Which of you genelmen is Masser Holmes?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37655' title='37655'>Holmes raised his pipe with a languid smile.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37656' title='37656'>'Oh! it's you, is it?' said our visitor, coming with an unpleasant, stealthy step round the angle of the table. </span>
<span sid='37657' title='37657'>'See here, Masser Holmes, you keep your hands out of other folks' business. </span>
<span sid='37658' title='37658'>Leave folks to manage their own affairs. </span>
<span sid='37659' title='37659'>Got that, Masser Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37660' title='37660'>'Keep on talking,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='37661' title='37661'>'It's fine.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37662' title='37662'>'Oh! it's fine, is it?' growled the savage. </span>
<span sid='37663' title='37663'>'It won't be so damn fine if I have to trim you up a bit. </span>
<span sid='37664' title='37664'>I've handled your kind before now, and they didn't look fine when I was through with them. </span>
<span sid='37665' title='37665'>Look at that, Masser Holmes!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37666' title='37666'>He swung a huge knotted lump of a fist under my friend's nose. </span>
<span sid='37667' title='37667'>Holmes examined it closely with an air of great interest.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37668' title='37668'>'Were you born so?' he asked. </span>
<span sid='37669' title='37669'>'Or did it come by degrees?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37670' title='37670'>It may have been the icy coolness of my friend, or it may have been the slight clatter which I made as I picked up the poker. </span>
<span sid='37671' title='37671'>In any case, our visitor's manner became less flamboyant.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37672' title='37672'>'Well, I've given you fair warnin',' said he. </span>
<span sid='37673' title='37673'>'I've a friend that's interested out <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Harrow&t=h'>Harrow</a> way - you know what I'm meaning - and he don't intend to have no buttin' in by you. </span>
<span sid='37674' title='37674'>Got that? </span>
<span sid='37675' title='37675'>You ain't the law, and I ain't the law either, and if you come in I'll be on hand also. </span>
<span sid='37676' title='37676'>Don't you forget it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37677' title='37677'>'I've wanted to meet you for some time,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='37678' title='37678'>'I won't ask you to sit down, for I don't like the smell of you, but aren't you Steve Dixie, the bruiser?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37679' title='37679'>'That's my name, Masser Holmes, and you'll get put through it for sure if you give me any lip.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37680' title='37680'>'It is certainly the last thing you need,' said Holmes, staring at our visitor's hideous mouth. </span>
<span sid='37681' title='37681'>'But it was the killing of young Perkins outside the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Holborn&t=h'>Holborn</a> Bar - What! you're not going?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37682' title='37682'>The negro had sprung back, and his face was leaden. </span>
<span sid='37683' title='37683'>'I won't listen to no such talk,' said he. </span>
<span sid='37684' title='37684'>'What have I to do with this 'ere Perkins, Masser Holmes? </span>
<span sid='37685' title='37685'>I was trainin' at the Bull Ring in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Birmingham&t=h'>Birmingham</a> when this boy done gone get into trouble.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37686' title='37686'>'Yes, you'll tell the magistrate about it, Steve,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='37687' title='37687'>'I've been watching you and Barney Stockdale-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37688' title='37688'>'So help me the Lord! </span>
<span sid='37689' title='37689'>Masser Holmes-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37690' title='37690'>'That's enough. </span>
<span sid='37691' title='37691'>Get out of it. </span>
<span sid='37692' title='37692'>I'll pick you up when I want you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37693' title='37693'>'Good mornin', Masser Holmes. </span>
<span sid='37694' title='37694'>I hope there ain't no hard feelin's about this 'ere visit?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37695' title='37695'>'There will be unless you tell me who sent you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37696' title='37696'>'Why, there ain't no secret about that, Masser Holmes. </span>
<span sid='37697' title='37697'>It was the same gentleman that you have just done gone mention.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37698' title='37698'>'And who set him on to it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37699' title='37699'>'S'elp me. </span>
<span sid='37700' title='37700'>I don't know, Masser Holmes. </span>
<span sid='37701' title='37701'>He just say, "Steve, you go see Mr Holmes, and tell him his life ain't safe if he go down <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Harrow&t=h'>Harrow</a> way." </span>
<span sid='37702' title='37702'>That's the whole truth.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37703' title='37703'>Without waiting for any further questioning, our visitor bolted out of the room almost as precipitately as he had entered. </span>
<span sid='37704' title='37704'>Holmes knocked out the ashes of his pipe with a quiet chuckle.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37705' title='37705'>'I am glad you were not forced to break his woolly head, Watson. </span>
<span sid='37706' title='37706'>I observed your manoeuvres with the poker. </span>
<span sid='37707' title='37707'>But he is really rather a harmless fellow, a great muscular, foolish, blustering baby, and easily cowed, as you have seen. </span>
<span sid='37708' title='37708'>He is one of the Spencer John gang and has taken part in some dirty work of late which I may clear up when I have time. </span>
<span sid='37709' title='37709'>His immediate principal, Barney, is a more astute person. </span>
<span sid='37710' title='37710'>They specialize in assaults, intimidation, and the like. </span>
<span sid='37711' title='37711'>What I want to know is, who is at the back of them on this particular occasion?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37712' title='37712'>'But why do they want to intimidate you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37713' title='37713'>'It is this <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Harrow&t=h'>Harrow</a> Weald case. </span>
<span sid='37714' title='37714'>It decides me to look into the matter, for if it is worth anyone's while to take so much trouble, there must be something in it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37715' title='37715'>'But what is it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37716' title='37716'>'I was going to tell you when we had this comic interlude. </span>
<span sid='37717' title='37717'>Here is Mrs Maberley's note. </span>
<span sid='37718' title='37718'>If you care to come with me we will wire her and go out at once.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37719' title='37719'>DEAR MR SHERLOCK HOLMES, [I read]</span>
<p>
<span sid='37720' title='37720'>I have had a succession of strange incidents occur to me in connection with this house, and I should much value your advice. </span>
<span sid='37721' title='37721'>You would find me at home any time to-morrow. </span>
<span sid='37722' title='37722'>The house is within a short walk of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Weald&t=h'>the Weald</a> Station. </span>
<span sid='37723' title='37723'>I believe that my late husband, Mortimer Maberley, was one of your early clients.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37724' title='37724'>Yours faithfully, </span>
<span sid='37725' title='37725'>MARY MABERLEY</span>
<p>
<span sid='37726' title='37726'>The address was 'The Three Gables, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Harrow&t=h'>Harrow</a> Weald'.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37727' title='37727'>'So that's that!' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='37728' title='37728'>'And now if you can spare the time, Watson, we will get upon our way.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37729' title='37729'>A short railway journey, and a shorter drive, brought us to the house, a brick and timber villa, standing in its own acre of undeveloped grassland. </span>
<span sid='37730' title='37730'>Three small projections above the upper windows made a feeble attempt to justify its name. </span>
<span sid='37731' title='37731'>Behind was a grove of melancholy, half-grown pines, and the whole aspect of the place was poor and depressing. </span>
<span sid='37732' title='37732'>None the less, we found the house to be well furnished, and the lady who received us was a most engaging elderly person, who bore every mark of refinement and culture.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37733' title='37733'>'I remember your husband well, madam,' said Holmes, 'though it is some years since he used my services in some trifling matter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37734' title='37734'>'Probably you would be more familiar with the name of my son Douglas.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37735' title='37735'>Holmes looked at her with great interest.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37736' title='37736'>'Dear me! </span>
<span sid='37737' title='37737'>Are you the mother of Douglas Maberley? </span>
<span sid='37738' title='37738'>I knew him slightly. </span>
<span sid='37739' title='37739'>But, of course, all <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> knew him. </span>
<span sid='37740' title='37740'>What a magnificent creature he was! </span>
<span sid='37741' title='37741'>Where is he now?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37742' title='37742'>'Dead, Mr Holmes, dead! </span>
<span sid='37743' title='37743'>He was AttachÃ© at Rome, and he died there of pneumonia last month.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37744' title='37744'>'I am sorry. </span>
<span sid='37745' title='37745'>One could not connect death with such a man. </span>
<span sid='37746' title='37746'>I have never known anyone so vitally alive. </span>
<span sid='37747' title='37747'>He lived intensely - every fibre of him!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37748' title='37748'>'Too intensely, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='37749' title='37749'>That was the ruin of him. </span>
<span sid='37750' title='37750'>You remember him as he was - debonair and splendid. </span>
<span sid='37751' title='37751'>You did not see the moody, morose, brooding creature into which he developed. </span>
<span sid='37752' title='37752'>His heart was broken. </span>
<span sid='37753' title='37753'>In a single month I seemed to see my gallant boy turn into a worn-out cynical man.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37754' title='37754'>'A love affair - a woman?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37755' title='37755'>'Or a fiend. </span>
<span sid='37756' title='37756'>Well, it was not to talk of my poor lad that I asked you to come, Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37757' title='37757'>'Dr Watson and I are at your service.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37758' title='37758'>'There have been some very strange happenings. </span>
<span sid='37759' title='37759'>I have been in this house more than a year now, and as I wished to lead a retired life I have seen little of my neighbours. </span>
<span sid='37760' title='37760'>Three days ago I had a call from a man who said that he was a house agent. </span>
<span sid='37761' title='37761'>He said that this house would exactly suit a client of his and that if I would part with it money would be no object. </span>
<span sid='37762' title='37762'>It seemed to me very strange, as there are several empty houses on the market which appear to be equally eligible, but naturally I was interested in what he said. </span>
<span sid='37763' title='37763'>I therefore named a price which was five hundred pounds more than I gave. </span>
<span sid='37764' title='37764'>He at once closed with the offer, but added that his client desired to buy the furniture as well and would I put a price upon it. </span>
<span sid='37765' title='37765'>Some of this furniture is from my old home, and it is, as you see, very good, so that I named a good round sum. </span>
<span sid='37766' title='37766'>To this also he at once agreed. </span>
<span sid='37767' title='37767'>I had always wanted to travel, and the bargain was so good a one that it really seemed that I should be my own mistress for the rest of my life.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37768' title='37768'>'Yesterday the man arrived with the agreement all drawn out. </span>
<span sid='37769' title='37769'>Luckily I showed it to Mr Sutro, my lawyer, who lives in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Harrow&t=h'>Harrow</a>. </span>
<span sid='37770' title='37770'>He said to me, "This is a very strange document. </span>
<span sid='37771' title='37771'>Are you aware that if you sign it you could not legally take anything out of the house - not even your own private possessions?" </span>
<span sid='37772' title='37772'>When the man came again in the evening I pointed this out, and I said that I meant only to sell the furniture.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37773' title='37773'>'"No, no, everything," said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37774' title='37774'>'"But my clothes? </span>
<span sid='37775' title='37775'>My jewels?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='37776' title='37776'>'"Well, well, some concession might be made for your personal effects. </span>
<span sid='37777' title='37777'>But nothing shall go out of the house unchecked. </span>
<span sid='37778' title='37778'>My client is a very liberal man, but he has his fads and his own way of doing things. </span>
<span sid='37779' title='37779'>It is everything or nothing with him."</span>
<p>
<span sid='37780' title='37780'>'"Then it must be nothing," said I. </span>
<span sid='37781' title='37781'>And there the matter was left, but the whole thing seemed to me to be so unusual that I thought-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37782' title='37782'>Here we had a very extraordinary interruption.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37783' title='37783'>Holmes raised his hand for silence. </span>
<span sid='37784' title='37784'>Then he strode across the room, flung open the door, and dragged in a great gaunt woman whom he had seized by the shoulder. </span>
<span sid='37785' title='37785'>She entered with ungainly struggles, like some huge awkward chicken, torn squawking out of its coop.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37786' title='37786'>'Leave me alone! </span>
<span sid='37787' title='37787'>What are you a-doin' of?' she screeched.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37788' title='37788'>'Why, Susan, what is this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37789' title='37789'>'Well, ma'am, I was comin' in to ask if the visitors was stayin' for lunch when this man jumped out at me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37790' title='37790'>'I have been listening to her for the last five minutes, but did not wish to interrupt your most interesting narrative. </span>
<span sid='37791' title='37791'>Just a little wheezy, Susan, are you not? </span>
<span sid='37792' title='37792'>You breathe too heavily for that kind of work.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37793' title='37793'>Susan turned a sulky but amazed face upon her captor. </span>
<span sid='37794' title='37794'>'Who be you, anyhow, and what right have you a-pullin' me about like this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37795' title='37795'>'It was merely that I wished to ask a question in your presence. </span>
<span sid='37796' title='37796'>Did you, Mrs Maberley, mention to anyone that you were going to write to me and consult me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37797' title='37797'>'No, Mr Holmes, I did not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37798' title='37798'>'Who posted your letter?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37799' title='37799'>'Susan did.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37800' title='37800'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='37801' title='37801'>Now, Susan, to whom was it that you wrote or sent a message to say that your mistress was asking advice from me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37802' title='37802'>'It's a lie. </span>
<span sid='37803' title='37803'>I sent no message.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37804' title='37804'>'Now, Susan, wheezy people may not live long, you know. </span>
<span sid='37805' title='37805'>It's a wicked thing to tell fibs. </span>
<span sid='37806' title='37806'>Whom did you tell?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37807' title='37807'>'Susan!' cried her mistress, 'I believe you are a bad, treacherous woman. </span>
<span sid='37808' title='37808'>I remember now that I saw you speaking to someone over the hedge.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37809' title='37809'>'That was my own business,' said the woman sullenly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37810' title='37810'>'Suppose I tell you that it was Barney Stockdale to whom you spoke?' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37811' title='37811'>'Well, if you know, what do you want to ask for?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37812' title='37812'>'I was not sure, but I know now. </span>
<span sid='37813' title='37813'>Well now, Susan, it will be worth ten pounds to you if you will tell me who is at the back of Barney.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37814' title='37814'>'Someone that could lay down a thousand pounds for every ten you have in the world.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37815' title='37815'>'So, a rich man? </span>
<span sid='37816' title='37816'>No, you smiled - a rich woman. </span>
<span sid='37817' title='37817'>Now we have got so far, you may as well give the name and earn the tenner.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37818' title='37818'>'I'll see you in hell first.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37819' title='37819'>'Oh, Susan! </span>
<span sid='37820' title='37820'>Language!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37821' title='37821'>'I am clearing out of here. </span>
<span sid='37822' title='37822'>I've had enough of you all. </span>
<span sid='37823' title='37823'>I'll send for my box to-morrow.' </span>
<span sid='37824' title='37824'>She flounced for the door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37825' title='37825'>'Good-bye, Susan. </span>
<span sid='37826' title='37826'>Paregoric is the stuff... </span>
<span sid='37827' title='37827'>Now,' he continued, turning suddenly from lively to severe when the door had closed behind the flushed and angry woman, 'this gang means business. </span>
<span sid='37828' title='37828'>Look how close they play the game. </span>
<span sid='37829' title='37829'>Your letter to me had the 10 p.m. postmark. </span>
<span sid='37830' title='37830'>And yet Susan passes the word to Barney. </span>
<span sid='37831' title='37831'>Barney has time to go to his employer and get instructions, he or she - I incline to the latter from Susan's grin when she thought I had blundered - forms a plan. </span>
<span sid='37832' title='37832'>Black Steve is called in, and I am warned off by eleven o'clock next morning. </span>
<span sid='37833' title='37833'>That's quick work, you know.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37834' title='37834'>'But what do they want?</span>
<p>
<span sid='37835' title='37835'>'Yes, that's the question. </span>
<span sid='37836' title='37836'>Who had the house before you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37837' title='37837'>'A retired sea captain, called Ferguson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37838' title='37838'>'Anything remarkable about him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37839' title='37839'>'Not that ever I heard of.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37840' title='37840'>'I was wondering whether he could have buried something. </span>
<span sid='37841' title='37841'>Of course, when people bury treasure nowadays they do it in the Post Office bank. </span>
<span sid='37842' title='37842'>But there are always some lunatics about. </span>
<span sid='37843' title='37843'>It would be a dull world without them. </span>
<span sid='37844' title='37844'>At first I thought of some buried valuable. </span>
<span sid='37845' title='37845'>But why, in that case, should they want your furniture? </span>
<span sid='37846' title='37846'>You don't happen to have a Raphael or a first folio Shakespeare without knowing it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37847' title='37847'>'No, I don't think I have anything rarer than a Crown <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Derby&t=h'>Derby</a> tea-set.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37848' title='37848'>'That would hardly justify all this mystery. </span>
<span sid='37849' title='37849'>Besides, why should they not openly state what they want? </span>
<span sid='37850' title='37850'>If they covet your tea-set, they can surely offer a price for it without buying you out, lock, stock, and barrel. </span>
<span sid='37851' title='37851'>No, as I read it, there is something which you do not know that you have, and which you would not give up if you did know.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37852' title='37852'>'That is how I read it,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37853' title='37853'>'Dr Watson agrees, so that settles it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37854' title='37854'>'Well, Mr Holmes, what can it be?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37855' title='37855'>'Let us see whether by this purely mental analysis we can get it to a finer point. </span>
<span sid='37856' title='37856'>You have been in this house a year.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37857' title='37857'>'Nearly two.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37858' title='37858'>'All the better. </span>
<span sid='37859' title='37859'>During this long period no one wants anything from you. </span>
<span sid='37860' title='37860'>Now suddenly within three or four days you have urgent demands. </span>
<span sid='37861' title='37861'>What would you gather from that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37862' title='37862'>'It can only mean,' said I, 'that the object, whatever it may be, has only just come into the house.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37863' title='37863'>'Settled once again,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='37864' title='37864'>'Now, Mrs Maberley, has any object just arrived?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37865' title='37865'>'No, I have bought nothing new this year.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37866' title='37866'>'Indeed! </span>
<span sid='37867' title='37867'>That is very remarkable. </span>
<span sid='37868' title='37868'>Well, I think we had best let matters develop a little further until we have clearer data. </span>
<span sid='37869' title='37869'>Is that lawyer of yours a capable man?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37870' title='37870'>'Mr Sutro is most capable.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37871' title='37871'>'Have you another maid, or was the fair Susan, who has just banged your front door, alone?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37872' title='37872'>'I have a young girl.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37873' title='37873'>'Try and get Sutro to spend a night or two in the house. </span>
<span sid='37874' title='37874'>You might possibly want protection.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37875' title='37875'>'Against whom?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37876' title='37876'>'Who knows? </span>
<span sid='37877' title='37877'>The matter is certainly obscure. </span>
<span sid='37878' title='37878'>If I can't find what they are after, I must approach the matter from the other end, and try to get at the principal. </span>
<span sid='37879' title='37879'>Did this house-agent man give any address?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37880' title='37880'>'Simply his card and occupation. </span>
<span sid='37881' title='37881'>Haines-Johnson, Auctioneer and Valuer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37882' title='37882'>'I don't think we shall find him in the Directory. </span>
<span sid='37883' title='37883'>Honest businessmen don't conceal their place of business. </span>
<span sid='37884' title='37884'>Well, you will let me know any fresh development. </span>
<span sid='37885' title='37885'>I have taken up your case, and you may rely upon it that I shall see it through.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37886' title='37886'>As we passed through the hall Holmes's eyes, which missed nothing, lighted upon several trunks and cases which were piled in the corner The labels shone out upon them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37887' title='37887'>'"<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Milan&t=h'>Milan</a>o." </span>
<span sid='37888' title='37888'>"<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lucerne&t=h'>Lucerne</a>." </span>
<span sid='37889' title='37889'>These are from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Italy&t=h'>Italy</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37890' title='37890'>'They are poor Douglas's things.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37891' title='37891'>'You have not unpacked them? </span>
<span sid='37892' title='37892'>How long have you had them?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37893' title='37893'>'They arrived last week.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37894' title='37894'>'But you said - why, surely this might be the missing link. </span>
<span sid='37895' title='37895'>How do we know that there is not something of value there?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37896' title='37896'>'There could not possibly be, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='37897' title='37897'>Poor Douglas had only his pay and a small annuity. </span>
<span sid='37898' title='37898'>What could he have of value?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37899' title='37899'>Holmes was lost in thought.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37900' title='37900'>'Delay no longer, Mrs Maberley,' he said at last. </span>
<span sid='37901' title='37901'>'Have these things taken upstairs to your bedroom. </span>
<span sid='37902' title='37902'>Examine them as soon as possible and see what they contain. </span>
<span sid='37903' title='37903'>I will come to-morrow and hear your report.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37904' title='37904'>It was quite evident that The Three Gables was under very close surveillance, for as we came round the high hedge at the end of the lane there was the negro prize-fighter standing in the shadow. </span>
<span sid='37905' title='37905'>We came on him quite suddenly, and a grim and menacing figure he looked in that lonely place. </span>
<span sid='37906' title='37906'>Holmes clapped his hand to his pocket.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37907' title='37907'>'Lookin' for your gun, Masser Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37908' title='37908'>'No, for my scent-bottle, Steve.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37909' title='37909'>'You are funny, Masser Holmes, ain't you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37910' title='37910'>'It won't be funny for you, Steve, if I get after you. </span>
<span sid='37911' title='37911'>I gave you fair warning this morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37912' title='37912'>'Well, Masser Holmes, I done gone think over what you said, and I don't want no more talk about that affair of Masser Perkins. </span>
<span sid='37913' title='37913'>S'pose I can help you, Masser Holmes, I will.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37914' title='37914'>'Well, then, tell me who is behind you on this job?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37915' title='37915'>'So help me the Lord! </span>
<span sid='37916' title='37916'>Masser Holmes, I told you the truth before. </span>
<span sid='37917' title='37917'>I don't know. </span>
<span sid='37918' title='37918'>My boss Barney gives me orders and that's all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37919' title='37919'>'Well, just bear in mind, Steve, that the lady in that house, and everything under that roof, is under my protection. </span>
<span sid='37920' title='37920'>Don't you forget it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37921' title='37921'>'All right, Masser Holmes. </span>
<span sid='37922' title='37922'>I'll remember.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37923' title='37923'>'I've got him thoroughly frightened for his own skin, Watson,' Holmes remarked as we walked on. </span>
<span sid='37924' title='37924'>'I think he would double-cross his employer if he knew who he was. </span>
<span sid='37925' title='37925'>It was lucky I had some knowledge of the Spencer John crowd, and that Steve was one of them. </span>
<span sid='37926' title='37926'>Now, Watson, this is a case for Langdale Pike, and I am going to see him now. </span>
<span sid='37927' title='37927'>When I get back I may be clearer in the matter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37928' title='37928'>I saw no more of Holmes during the day, but I could well imagine how he spent it, for Langdale Pike was his human book of reference upon all matters of social scandal. </span>
<span sid='37929' title='37929'>This strange, languid creature spent his waking hours in the bow window of a St James's Street club, and was the receivingstation, as well as the transmitter, for all the gossip of the Metropolis. </span>
<span sid='37930' title='37930'>He made, it was said, a four-figure income by the paragraphs which he contributed every week to the garbage papers which cater for an inquisitive public. </span>
<span sid='37931' title='37931'>If ever, far down in the turbid depths of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> life, there was some strange swirl or eddy, it was marked with automatic exactness by this human dial upon the surface. </span>
<span sid='37932' title='37932'>Holmes discreetly helped Langdale to knowledge, and on occasion was helped in turn.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37933' title='37933'>When I met my friend in his room early next morning, I was conscious from his bearing that all was well, but none the less a most unpleasant surprise was awaiting us. </span>
<span sid='37934' title='37934'>It took the shape of the following telegram:</span>
<p>
<span sid='37935' title='37935'>Please come out at once. </span>
<span sid='37936' title='37936'>Client's house burgled in the night. </span>
<span sid='37937' title='37937'>Police in possession.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37938' title='37938'>SUTRO</span>
<p>
<span sid='37939' title='37939'>Holmes whistled. </span>
<span sid='37940' title='37940'>'The drama has come to a crisis, and quicker than I had expected. </span>
<span sid='37941' title='37941'>There is a great driving-power at the back of this business, Watson, which does not surprise me after what I have heard. </span>
<span sid='37942' title='37942'>This Sutro, of course, is her lawyer. </span>
<span sid='37943' title='37943'>I made a mistake, I fear, in not asking you to spend the night on guard. </span>
<span sid='37944' title='37944'>This fellow has clearly proved a broken reed. </span>
<span sid='37945' title='37945'>Well, there is nothing for it but another journey to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Harrow&t=h'>Harrow</a> Weald.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37946' title='37946'>We found The Three Gables a very different establishment to the orderly household of the previous day. </span>
<span sid='37947' title='37947'>A small group of idlers had assembled at the garden gate, while a couple of constables were examining the windows and the geranium beds. </span>
<span sid='37948' title='37948'>Within we met a grey old gentleman, who introduced himself as the lawyer, together with a bustling, rubicund Inspector, who greeted Holmes as an old friend.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37949' title='37949'>'Well, Mr Holmes, no chance for you in this case, I'm afraid. </span>
<span sid='37950' title='37950'>Just a common, ordinary burglary, and well within the capacity of the poor old police. </span>
<span sid='37951' title='37951'>No experts need apply.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37952' title='37952'>'I am sure the case is in very good hands,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37953' title='37953'>'Merely a common burglary, you say?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37954' title='37954'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='37955' title='37955'>We know pretty well who the men are and where to find them. </span>
<span sid='37956' title='37956'>It is that gang of Barney Stockdale, with the big nigger in it - they've been seen about here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37957' title='37957'>'Excellent! </span>
<span sid='37958' title='37958'>What did they get?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37959' title='37959'>'Well, they don't seem to have got much. </span>
<span sid='37960' title='37960'>Mrs Maberley was chloroformed and the house was - Ah! here is the lady herself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37961' title='37961'>Our friend of yesterday, looking very pale and ill, had entered the room, leaning upon a little maid-servant.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37962' title='37962'>'You gave me good advice, Mr Holmes,' said she, smiling ruefully. </span>
<span sid='37963' title='37963'>'Alas, I did not take it! </span>
<span sid='37964' title='37964'>I did not wish to trouble Mr Sutro, and so I was unprotected.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37965' title='37965'>'I only heard of it this morning,' the lawyer explained.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37966' title='37966'>'Mr Holmes advised me to have some friend in the house. </span>
<span sid='37967' title='37967'>I neglected his advice, and I have paid for it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37968' title='37968'>'You look wretchedly ill,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='37969' title='37969'>'Perhaps you are hardly equal to telling me what occurred.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37970' title='37970'>'It is all here,' said the Inspector, tapping a bulky notebook.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37971' title='37971'>'Still, if the lady is not too exhausted-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37972' title='37972'>'There is really so little to tell. </span>
<span sid='37973' title='37973'>I have no doubt that wicked Susan had planned an entrance for them. </span>
<span sid='37974' title='37974'>They must have known the house to an inch. </span>
<span sid='37975' title='37975'>I was conscious for a moment of the chloroform rag which was thrust over my mouth, but I have no notion how long I may have been senseless. </span>
<span sid='37976' title='37976'>When I woke, one man was at the bedside and another was rising with a bundle in his hand from among my son's baggage, which was partially opened and littered over the floor. </span>
<span sid='37977' title='37977'>Before he could get away I sprang up and seized him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37978' title='37978'>'You took a big risk,' said the Inspector.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37979' title='37979'>'I clung to him, but he shook me off, and the other may have struck me, for I can remember no more. </span>
<span sid='37980' title='37980'>Mary the maid heard the noise and began screaming out of the window. </span>
<span sid='37981' title='37981'>That brought the police, but the rascals had got away.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37982' title='37982'>'What did they take?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37983' title='37983'>'Well, I don't think there is anything of value missing. </span>
<span sid='37984' title='37984'>I am sure there was nothing in my son's trunks.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37985' title='37985'>'Did the men leave no clue?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37986' title='37986'>'There was one sheet of paper which I may have torn from the man that I grasped. </span>
<span sid='37987' title='37987'>It was lying all crumpled on the floor. </span>
<span sid='37988' title='37988'>It is in my son's handwriting.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37989' title='37989'>'Which means that it is not of much use,' said the Inspector. </span>
<span sid='37990' title='37990'>'Now if it had been the burglar's-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37991' title='37991'>'Exactly,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='37992' title='37992'>'What rugged common sense! </span>
<span sid='37993' title='37993'>None the less, I should be curious to see it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37994' title='37994'>The Inspector drew a folded sheet of foolscap from his pocket-book.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37995' title='37995'>'I never pass anything, however trifling,' said he, with some pomposity. </span>
<span sid='37996' title='37996'>'That is my advice to you, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='37997' title='37997'>In twenty-five years' experience I have learned my lesson. </span>
<span sid='37998' title='37998'>There is always the chance of finger-marks or something.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37999' title='37999'>Holmes inspected the sheet of paper.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38000' title='38000'>'What do you make of it, Inspector?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38001' title='38001'>'Seems to be the end of some queer novel, so far as I can see.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38002' title='38002'>'It may certainly prove to be the end of a queer tale,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='38003' title='38003'>'You have noticed the number on the top of the page. </span>
<span sid='38004' title='38004'>It is two hundred and forty-five. </span>
<span sid='38005' title='38005'>Where are the odd two hundred and forty-four pages?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38006' title='38006'>'Well, I suppose the burglars got those. </span>
<span sid='38007' title='38007'>Much good may it do them!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38008' title='38008'>'It seems a queer thing to break into a house in order to steal such papers as that. </span>
<span sid='38009' title='38009'>Does it suggest anything to you, Inspector?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38010' title='38010'>'Yes, sir, it suggests that in their hurry the rascals just grabbed at what came first to hand. </span>
<span sid='38011' title='38011'>I wish them joy of what they got.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38012' title='38012'>'Why should they go to my son's things?' asked Mrs Maberley.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38013' title='38013'>'Well, they found nothing valuable downstairs, so they tried their luck upstairs. </span>
<span sid='38014' title='38014'>That is how I read it. </span>
<span sid='38015' title='38015'>What do you make of it, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38016' title='38016'>'I must think it over, Inspector. </span>
<span sid='38017' title='38017'>Come to the window, Watson.' </span>
<span sid='38018' title='38018'>Then, as we stood together, he read over the fragment of paper. </span>
<span sid='38019' title='38019'>It began in the middle of a sentence and ran like this:</span>
<p>
<span sid='38020' title='38020'>... face bled considerably from the cuts and blows, but it was nothing to the bleeding of his heart as he saw that lovely face, the face for which he had been prepared to sacrifice his very life, looking out at his agony and humiliation. </span>
<span sid='38021' title='38021'>She smiled - yes, by Heaven! she smiled, like the heartless fiend she was, as he looked up at her. </span>
<span sid='38022' title='38022'>It was at that moment that love died and hate was born. </span>
<span sid='38023' title='38023'>Man must live for something. </span>
<span sid='38024' title='38024'>If it is not for your embrace, my lady, then it shall surely be for your undoing and my complete revenge.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38025' title='38025'>'Queer grammar!' said Holmes, with a smile, as he handed the paper back to the Inspector. </span>
<span sid='38026' title='38026'>'Did you notice how the "he" suddenly changed to "my"? </span>
<span sid='38027' title='38027'>The writer was so carried away by his own story that he imagined himself at the supreme moment to be the hero.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38028' title='38028'>'It seemed mighty poor stuff,' said the Inspector, as he replaced it in his book. </span>
<span sid='38029' title='38029'>'What! are you off, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38030' title='38030'>'I don't think there is anything more for me to do now that the case is in such capable hands. </span>
<span sid='38031' title='38031'>By the way, Mrs Maberley, did you say you wished to travel?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38032' title='38032'>'It has always been my dream, Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38033' title='38033'>'Where would you like to go - Cairo, Madeira, the Riviera?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38034' title='38034'>'Oh! if I had the money I would go round the world.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38035' title='38035'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='38036' title='38036'>Round the world. </span>
<span sid='38037' title='38037'>Well, good morning. </span>
<span sid='38038' title='38038'>I may drop you a line in the evening.' </span>
<span sid='38039' title='38039'>As we passed the window I caught a glimpse of the Inspector's smile and shake of the head. </span>
<span sid='38040' title='38040'>'These clever fellows have always a touch of madness.' </span>
<span sid='38041' title='38041'>That was what I read in the Inspector's smile.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38042' title='38042'>'Now, Watson, we are at the last lap of our little journey,' said Holmes, when we were back in the roar of Central <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> once more. </span>
<span sid='38043' title='38043'>'I think we had best clear the matter up at once, and it would be well that you should come with me, for it is safer to have a witness when you are dealing with such a lady as Isadora Klein.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38044' title='38044'>We had taken a cab and were speeding to some address in Grosvenor Square. </span>
<span sid='38045' title='38045'>Holmes had been sunk in thought, but he roused himself suddenly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38046' title='38046'>'By the way, Watson, I suppose you see it all clearly?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38047' title='38047'>'No, I can't say that I do. </span>
<span sid='38048' title='38048'>I only gather that we are going to see the lady who is behind all this mischief.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38049' title='38049'>'Exactly! </span>
<span sid='38050' title='38050'>But does the name Isadora Klein convey nothing to you? </span>
<span sid='38051' title='38051'>She was, of course, the celebrated beauty. </span>
<span sid='38052' title='38052'>There was never a woman to touch her. </span>
<span sid='38053' title='38053'>She is pure Spanish, the real blood of the masterful conquistadores, and her people have been leaders in Pernambuco for generations. </span>
<span sid='38054' title='38054'>She married the aged German sugar king, Klein, and presently found herself the richest as well as the most lovely widow upon earth. </span>
<span sid='38055' title='38055'>Then there was an interval of adventure when she pleased her own tastes. </span>
<span sid='38056' title='38056'>She had several lovers, and Douglas Maberley, one of the most striking men in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, was one of them. </span>
<span sid='38057' title='38057'>It was by all accounts more than an adventure with him. </span>
<span sid='38058' title='38058'>He was not a Society butterfly, but a strong, proud man who gave and expected all. </span>
<span sid='38059' title='38059'>But she is the "belle dame sans merci" of fiction. </span>
<span sid='38060' title='38060'>When her caprice is satisfied, the matter is ended, and if the other party in the matter can't take her word for it, she knows how to bring it home to him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38061' title='38061'>'Then that was his own story-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38062' title='38062'>'Ah! you are piecing it together now. </span>
<span sid='38063' title='38063'>I hear that she is about to marry the young Duke of Lomond, who might almost be her son. </span>
<span sid='38064' title='38064'>His Grace's ma might overlook the age, but a big scandal would be a different matter, so it is imperative - Ah! here we are.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38065' title='38065'>It was one of the finest corner-houses of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the West&t=h'>the West</a> End. </span>
<span sid='38066' title='38066'>A machine-like footman took up our cards and returned with word that the lady was not at home. </span>
<span sid='38067' title='38067'>'Then we shall wait until she is,' said Holmes cheerfully.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38068' title='38068'>The machine broke down.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38069' title='38069'>'Not at home means not at home to you,' said the footman.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38070' title='38070'>'Good,' Holmes answered. </span>
<span sid='38071' title='38071'>'That means that we shall not have to wait. </span>
<span sid='38072' title='38072'>Kindly give this note to your mistress.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38073' title='38073'>He scribbled three or four words upon a sheet of his notebook, folded it, and handed it to the man.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38074' title='38074'>'What did you say, Holmes?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38075' title='38075'>'I simply wrote "Shall it be the police, then?" </span>
<span sid='38076' title='38076'>I think that should pass us in.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38077' title='38077'>It did - with amazing celerity. </span>
<span sid='38078' title='38078'>A minute later we were in an Arabian Nights drawing-room, vast and wonderful, in a half gloom, picked out with an occasional pink electric light. </span>
<span sid='38079' title='38079'>The lady had come, I felt, to that time of life when even the proudest beauty finds the half-light more welcome. </span>
<span sid='38080' title='38080'>She rose from the settee as we entered: tall, queenly, a perfect figure, a lovely mask-like face, with two wonderful Spanish eyes which looked murder at us both.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38081' title='38081'>'What is this intrusion - and this insulting message?' she asked, holding up the slip of paper.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38082' title='38082'>'I need not explain, madame. </span>
<span sid='38083' title='38083'>I have too much respect for your intelligence to do so - though I confess that intelligence has been surprisingly at fault of late.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38084' title='38084'>'How so, sir?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38085' title='38085'>'By supposing that your hired bullies could frighten me from my work. </span>
<span sid='38086' title='38086'>Surely no man would take up my profession if it were not that danger attracts him. </span>
<span sid='38087' title='38087'>It was you, then, who forced me to examine the case of young Maberley.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38088' title='38088'>'I have no idea what you are talking about. </span>
<span sid='38089' title='38089'>What have I to do with hired bullies?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38090' title='38090'>Holmes turned away wearily.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38091' title='38091'>'Yes, I have overrated your intelligence. </span>
<span sid='38092' title='38092'>Well, good afternoon!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38093' title='38093'>'Stop! </span>
<span sid='38094' title='38094'>Where are you going?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38095' title='38095'>'To <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38096' title='38096'>We had not got half-way to the door before she had overtaken us and was holding his arm. </span>
<span sid='38097' title='38097'>She had turned in a moment from steel to velvet.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38098' title='38098'>'Come and sit down, gentlemen. </span>
<span sid='38099' title='38099'>Let us talk this matter over. </span>
<span sid='38100' title='38100'>I feel that I may be frank with you, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='38101' title='38101'>You have the feelings of a gentleman. </span>
<span sid='38102' title='38102'>How quick a woman's instinct is to find it out. </span>
<span sid='38103' title='38103'>I will treat you as a friend.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38104' title='38104'>'I cannot promise to reciprocate, madame. </span>
<span sid='38105' title='38105'>I am not the law, but I represent justice so far as my feeble powers go. </span>
<span sid='38106' title='38106'>I am ready to listen, and then I will tell you how I will act.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38107' title='38107'>'No doubt it was foolish of me to threaten a brave man like yourself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38108' title='38108'>'What was really foolish, madame, is that you have placed yourself in the power of a band of rascals who may blackmail or give you away.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38109' title='38109'>'No, no! </span>
<span sid='38110' title='38110'>I am not so simple. </span>
<span sid='38111' title='38111'>Since I have promised to be frank, I may say that no one, save Barney Stockdale and Susan, his wife, have the least idea who their employer is. </span>
<span sid='38112' title='38112'>As to them, well, it is not the first-' </span>
<span sid='38113' title='38113'>She smiled and nodded, with a charming coquettish intimacy.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38114' title='38114'>'I see. </span>
<span sid='38115' title='38115'>You've tested them before.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38116' title='38116'>'They are good hounds who run silent.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38117' title='38117'>'Such hounds have a way sooner or later of biting the hand that feeds them. </span>
<span sid='38118' title='38118'>They will be arrested for this burglary. </span>
<span sid='38119' title='38119'>The police are already after them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38120' title='38120'>'They will take what comes to them. </span>
<span sid='38121' title='38121'>That is what they are paid for. </span>
<span sid='38122' title='38122'>I shall not appear in the matter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38123' title='38123'>'Unless I bring you into it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38124' title='38124'>'No, no, you would not. </span>
<span sid='38125' title='38125'>You are a gentleman. </span>
<span sid='38126' title='38126'>It is a woman's secret.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38127' title='38127'>'In the first place you must give back this manuscript.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38128' title='38128'>She broke into a ripple of laughter, and walked to the fire-place. </span>
<span sid='38129' title='38129'>There was a calcined mass which she broke up with the poker. </span>
<span sid='38130' title='38130'>'Shall I give this back?' she asked. </span>
<span sid='38131' title='38131'>So roguish and exquisite did she look as she stood before us with a challenging smile that I felt of all Holmes's criminals this was the one whom he would find it hardest to face. </span>
<span sid='38132' title='38132'>However, he was immune from sentiment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38133' title='38133'>'That seals your fate,' he said coldly. </span>
<span sid='38134' title='38134'>'You are very prompt in your actions, madame, but you have overdone it on this occasion.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38135' title='38135'>She threw the poker down with a clatter.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38136' title='38136'>'How hard you are!' she cried. </span>
<span sid='38137' title='38137'>'May I tell you the whole story?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38138' title='38138'>'I fancy I could tell it to you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38139' title='38139'>'But you must look at it with my eyes, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='38140' title='38140'>You must realize it from the point of view of a woman who sees all her life's ambitions about to be ruined at the last moment. </span>
<span sid='38141' title='38141'>Is such a woman to be blamed if she protects herself?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38142' title='38142'>'The original sin was yours.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38143' title='38143'>'Yes, yes! </span>
<span sid='38144' title='38144'>I admit it. </span>
<span sid='38145' title='38145'>He was a dear boy, Douglas, but it so chanced that he could not fit into my plans. </span>
<span sid='38146' title='38146'>He wanted marriage - marriage, Mr Holmes - with a penniless commoner. </span>
<span sid='38147' title='38147'>Nothing less would serve him. </span>
<span sid='38148' title='38148'>Then he became pertinacious. </span>
<span sid='38149' title='38149'>Because I had given he seemed to think that I still must give, and to him only. </span>
<span sid='38150' title='38150'>It was intolerable. </span>
<span sid='38151' title='38151'>At last I had to make him realize it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38152' title='38152'>'By hiring ruffians to beat him under your own window.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38153' title='38153'>'You do indeed seem to know everything. </span>
<span sid='38154' title='38154'>Well, it is true. </span>
<span sid='38155' title='38155'>Barney and the boys drove him away, and were, I admit, a little rough in doing so. </span>
<span sid='38156' title='38156'>But what did he do then? </span>
<span sid='38157' title='38157'>Could I have believed that a gentleman would do such an act? </span>
<span sid='38158' title='38158'>He wrote a book in which he described his own story. </span>
<span sid='38159' title='38159'>I, of course, was the wolf, he was the lamb. </span>
<span sid='38160' title='38160'>It was all there, under different names, of course, but who in all <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> would have failed to recognize it? </span>
<span sid='38161' title='38161'>What do you say to that, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38162' title='38162'>'Well, he was within his rights.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38163' title='38163'>'It was as if the air of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Italy&t=h'>Italy</a> had got into his blood and brought with it the old cruel Italian spirit. </span>
<span sid='38164' title='38164'>He wrote to me and sent me a copy of his book that I might have the torture of anticipation. </span>
<span sid='38165' title='38165'>There were two copies, he said - one for me, one for his publisher.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38166' title='38166'>'How did you know the publisher's had not reached him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38167' title='38167'>'I knew who his publisher was. </span>
<span sid='38168' title='38168'>It is not his only novel, you know. </span>
<span sid='38169' title='38169'>I found out that he had not heard from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Italy&t=h'>Italy</a>. </span>
<span sid='38170' title='38170'>Then came Douglas's sudden death. </span>
<span sid='38171' title='38171'>So long as that other manuscript was in the world there was no safety for me. </span>
<span sid='38172' title='38172'>Of course, it must be among his effects, and these would be returned to his mother. </span>
<span sid='38173' title='38173'>I set the gang at work. </span>
<span sid='38174' title='38174'>One of them got into the house as servant. </span>
<span sid='38175' title='38175'>I wanted to do the thing honestly. </span>
<span sid='38176' title='38176'>I really and truly did. </span>
<span sid='38177' title='38177'>I was ready to buy the house and everything in it. </span>
<span sid='38178' title='38178'>I offered any price she cared to ask. </span>
<span sid='38179' title='38179'>I only tried the other way when everything else had failed. </span>
<span sid='38180' title='38180'>Now, Mr Holmes, granting that I was too hard on Douglas - and, God knows, I am sorry for it! - what else could I do with my whole future at stake?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38181' title='38181'>Sherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38182' title='38182'>'Well, well,' said he, 'I suppose I shall have to compound a felony as usual. </span>
<span sid='38183' title='38183'>How much does it cost to go round the world in first-class style?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38184' title='38184'>The lady stared in amazement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38185' title='38185'>'Could it be done on five thousand pounds?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38186' title='38186'>'Well, I should think so, indeed!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38187' title='38187'>'Very good. </span>
<span sid='38188' title='38188'>I think you will sign me a cheque for that, and I will see that it comes to Mrs Maberley. </span>
<span sid='38189' title='38189'>You owe her a little change of air. </span>
<span sid='38190' title='38190'>Meantime, lady' - he wagged a cautionary forefinger - 'have a care! </span>
<span sid='38191' title='38191'>Have a care! </span>
<span sid='38192' title='38192'>You can't play with edged tools for ever without cutting those dainty hands.'</span>
