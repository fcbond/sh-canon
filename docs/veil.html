<h1><span sid='29071' title='29071'>The Adventure of the Veiled Lodger</span></h1>
<p class="subtitle">Arthur Conan Doyle<label for="sn-meta-veil" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-meta-veil" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><!--googleoff: all--><b>Story Number</b>: 59<br><b>Published in</b>: The Liberty magazine, 22 January 1927 (US)<br><b>Collected in</b>: The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes<!--googleon: all--></span></p>
<p>
<span sid='29072' title='29072'>When one considers that Mr Sherlock Holmes was in active practice for twenty-three years, and that during seventeen of these I was allowed to co-operate with him and to keep notes of his doings, it will be clear that I have a mass of material at my command. </span>
<span sid='29073' title='29073'>The problem has always been, not to find, but to choose. </span>
<span sid='29074' title='29074'>There is the long row of year-books which fill a shelf, and there are the dispatchcases filled with documents, a perfect quarry for the student not only of crime, but of the social and official scandals of the late <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Victoria&t=h'>Victoria</a>n era. </span>
<span sid='29075' title='29075'>Concerning these latter, I may say that the writers of agonized letters, who beg that the honour of their families or the reputation of famous forebears may not be touched, have nothing to fear. </span>
<span sid='29076' title='29076'>The discretion and high sense of professional honour which have always distinguished my friend are still at work in the choice of these memoirs, and no confidence will be abused. </span>
<span sid='29077' title='29077'>I deprecate, however, in the strongest way the attempts which have been made lately to get at and to destroy these papers. </span>
<span sid='29078' title='29078'>The source of these outrages is known, and if they are repeated I have Mr Holmes's authority for saying that the whole story concerning the politician, the lighthouse, and the trained cormorant will be given to the public. </span>
<span sid='29079' title='29079'>There is at least one reader who will understand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29080' title='29080'>It is not reasonable to suppose that every one of these cases gave Holmes the opportunity of showing those curious gifts of instinct and observation which I have endeavoured to set forth in these memoirs. </span>
<span sid='29081' title='29081'>Sometimes he had with much effort to pick the fruit, sometimes it fell easily into his lap. </span>
<span sid='29082' title='29082'>But the most terrible human tragedies were often involved in these cases which brought him the fewest personal opportunities, and it is one of these which I now desire to record. </span>
<span sid='29083' title='29083'>In telling it, I have made a slight change of name and place, but otherwise the facts are as stated.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29084' title='29084'>One forenoon - it was late in 1896 - I received a hurried note from Holmes asking for my attendance. </span>
<span sid='29085' title='29085'>When I arrived, I found him seated in a smoke-laden atmosphere, with an elderly, motherly woman of the buxon landlady type in the corresponding chair in front of him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29086' title='29086'>'This is Mrs Merrilow, of South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a>,' said my friend, with a wave of the hand. </span>
<span sid='29087' title='29087'>'Mrs Merrilow does not object to tobacco, Watson, if you wish to indulge your filthy habits. </span>
<span sid='29088' title='29088'>Mrs Merrilow has an interesting story to tell which may well lead to further developments in which your presence may be useful.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29089' title='29089'>'Anything I can do-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29090' title='29090'>'You will understand, Mrs Merrilow, that if I come to Mrs Ronder I should prefer to have a witness. </span>
<span sid='29091' title='29091'>You will make her understand that before we arrive.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29092' title='29092'>'Lord bless you, Mr Holmes,' said our visitor, 'she is that anxious to see you that you might bring the whole parish at your heels!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29093' title='29093'>'Then we shall come early in the afternoon. </span>
<span sid='29094' title='29094'>Let us see that we have our facts correct before we start. </span>
<span sid='29095' title='29095'>If we go over them it will help Dr Watson to understand the situation. </span>
<span sid='29096' title='29096'>You say that Mrs Ronder has been your lodger for seven years and that you have only once seen her face.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29097' title='29097'>'And I wish to God I had not!' said Mrs Merrilow.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29098' title='29098'>'It was, I understand, terribly mutilated.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29099' title='29099'>'Well, Mr Holmes, you would hardly say it was a face at all. </span>
<span sid='29100' title='29100'>That's how it looked. </span>
<span sid='29101' title='29101'>Our milkman got a glimpse of her once peeping out of the upper window, and he dropped his tin and the milk all over the front garden. </span>
<span sid='29102' title='29102'>That is the kind of face it is. </span>
<span sid='29103' title='29103'>When I saw her - I happened on her unawares - she covered up quick, and then she said, "Now, Mrs Merrilow, you know at last why it is that I never raise my veil."'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29104' title='29104'>'Do you know anything about her history?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29105' title='29105'>'Nothing at all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29106' title='29106'>'Did she give references when she came?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29107' title='29107'>'No, sir, but she gave hard cash, and plenty of it. </span>
<span sid='29108' title='29108'>A quarter's rent right down on the table in advance and no arguing about terms. </span>
<span sid='29109' title='29109'>In these times a poor woman like me can't afford to turn down a chance like that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29110' title='29110'>'Did she give any reason for choosing your house?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29111' title='29111'>'Mine stands well back from the road and is more private than most. </span>
<span sid='29112' title='29112'>Then again, I only take the one, and I have no family of my own. </span>
<span sid='29113' title='29113'>I reckon she had tried others and found that mine suited her best. </span>
<span sid='29114' title='29114'>It's privacy she is after, and she is ready to pay for it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29115' title='29115'>'You say that she never showed her face from first to last save on the one accidental occasion. </span>
<span sid='29116' title='29116'>Well, it is a very remarkable story, most remarkable, and I don't wonder that you want it examined.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29117' title='29117'>'I don't, Mr Holmes, I am quite satisfied so long as I get my rent. </span>
<span sid='29118' title='29118'>You could not have a quieter lodger, or one who gives less trouble.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29119' title='29119'>'Then what has brought matters to a head?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29120' title='29120'>'Her health, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='29121' title='29121'>She seems to be wasting away. </span>
<span sid='29122' title='29122'>And there's something terrible on her mind. </span>
<span sid='29123' title='29123'>"Murder!" she cries. </span>
<span sid='29124' title='29124'>"Murder!" </span>
<span sid='29125' title='29125'>And once I heard her, "You cruel beast! </span>
<span sid='29126' title='29126'>You monster!" she cried. </span>
<span sid='29127' title='29127'>It was in the night, and it fair rang through the house and sent the shivers through me. </span>
<span sid='29128' title='29128'>So I went to her in the morning. </span>
<span sid='29129' title='29129'>"Mrs Ronder," I says, "if you have anything that is troubling your soul, there'Is the clergy," I says, "and there's the police. </span>
<span sid='29130' title='29130'>Between them you should get some help.""For God's sake, not the police!" </span>
<span sid='29131' title='29131'>says she, "and the clergy can't change what is past. </span>
<span sid='29132' title='29132'>And yet," she says, "it would ease my mind if someone knew the truth before I died." </span>
<span sid='29133' title='29133'>"Well," says I, "if you won't have the regulars, there is this detective man what we read about" - beggin' your pardon, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='29134' title='29134'>And she, she fair jumped at it. </span>
<span sid='29135' title='29135'>"That's the man," says she. </span>
<span sid='29136' title='29136'>"I wonder I never thought of it before. </span>
<span sid='29137' title='29137'>Bring him here, Mrs Merrilow, and if he won't come, tell him I am the wife of Ronder's wild-beast show. </span>
<span sid='29138' title='29138'>Say that, and give him the name Abbas Parva." </span>
<span sid='29139' title='29139'>Here it is as she wrote it, Abbas Parva. </span>
<span sid='29140' title='29140'>"That will bring him, if he's the man I think he is."'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29141' title='29141'>'And it will, too,' remarked Holmes. </span>
<span sid='29142' title='29142'>'Very good, Mrs Merrilow. </span>
<span sid='29143' title='29143'>I should like to have a little chat with Dr Watson. </span>
<span sid='29144' title='29144'>That will carry us till lunch-time. </span>
<span sid='29145' title='29145'>About three o'clock you may expect to see us at your house in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29146' title='29146'>Our visitor had no sooner waddled out of the room - no other verb can describe Mrs Merrilow's method of progression - than Sherlock Holmes threw himself with fierce energy upon the pile of commonplace books in the corner. </span>
<span sid='29147' title='29147'>For a few minutes there was a constant swish of the leaves, and then with a grunt of satisfaction he came upon what he sought. </span>
<span sid='29148' title='29148'>So excited was he that he did not rise, but sat upon the floor like some strange Buddha, with crossed legs, the huge books all round him, and one open upon his knees.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29149' title='29149'>'The case worried me at the time, Watson. </span>
<span sid='29150' title='29150'>Here are my marginal notes to prove it. </span>
<span sid='29151' title='29151'>I confess that I could make nothing of it. </span>
<span sid='29152' title='29152'>And yet I was convinced that the coroner was wrong. </span>
<span sid='29153' title='29153'>Have you no recollection of the Abbas Parva tragedy?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29154' title='29154'>'None, Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29155' title='29155'>'And yet you were with me then. </span>
<span sid='29156' title='29156'>But certainly my own impression was very superficial, for there was nothing to go by, and none of the parties had engaged my services. </span>
<span sid='29157' title='29157'>Perhaps you would care to read the papers?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29158' title='29158'>'Could you not give me the points?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29159' title='29159'>'That is very easily done. </span>
<span sid='29160' title='29160'>It will probably come back to your memory as I talk. </span>
<span sid='29161' title='29161'>Ronder, of course, was a household word. </span>
<span sid='29162' title='29162'>He was the rival of Wombwell, and of Sanger, one of the greatest showmen of his day. </span>
<span sid='29163' title='29163'>There is evidence, however, that he took to drink, and that both he and his show were on the down grade at the time of the great tragedy. </span>
<span sid='29164' title='29164'>The caravan had halted for the night at Abbas Parva, which is a small village in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Berkshire&t=h'>Berkshire</a>, when this horror occurred. </span>
<span sid='29165' title='29165'>They were on their way to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Wimbledon&t=h'>Wimbledon</a>, travelling by road, and they were simply camping, and not exhibiting, as the place is so small a one that it would not have paid them to open.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29166' title='29166'>They had among their exhibits a very fine North <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>n lion. </span>
<span sid='29167' title='29167'>Sahara King was its name, and it was the habit, both of Ronder and his wife, to give exhibitions inside its cage. </span>
<span sid='29168' title='29168'>Here, you see, is a photograph of the performance, by which you will perceive that Ronder was a huge porcine person, and that his wife was a very magnificent woman. </span>
<span sid='29169' title='29169'>It was deposed at the inquest that there had been some signs that the lion was dangerous, but, as usual, familiarity begat contempt, and no notice was taken of the fact.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29170' title='29170'>'It was usual for either Ronder or his wife to feed the lion at night. </span>
<span sid='29171' title='29171'>Sometimes one went, sometimes both, but they never allowed anyone else to do it, for they believed that so long as they were the food-carriers he would regard them as benefactors, and would never molest them. </span>
<span sid='29172' title='29172'>On this particular night, seven years ago, they both went, and a very terrible happening followed, the details of which have never been made clear.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29173' title='29173'>'It seems that the whole camp was roused near midnight by the roars of the animal and the screams of the woman. </span>
<span sid='29174' title='29174'>The different grooms and employÃ©s rushed from their tents, carrying lanterns, and by their light an awful sight was revealed. </span>
<span sid='29175' title='29175'>Ronder lay, with the back of his head crushed in and deep claw-marks across his scalp, some ten yards from the cage, which was open. </span>
<span sid='29176' title='29176'>Close to the door of the cage lay Mrs Ronder, upon her back, with the creature squatting and snarling above her. </span>
<span sid='29177' title='29177'>It had torn her face in such a fashion that it was never thought that she could live. </span>
<span sid='29178' title='29178'>Several of the circus men, headed by Leonardo, the strong man, and Griggs, the clown, drove the creature off with poles, upon which it sprang back into the cage, and was at once locked in. </span>
<span sid='29179' title='29179'>How it had got loose was a mystery. </span>
<span sid='29180' title='29180'>It was conjectured that the pair intended to enter the cage, but that when the door was loosed the creature bounded out upon them. </span>
<span sid='29181' title='29181'>There was no other point of interest in the evidence, save that the woman in a delirium of agony kept screaming, "Coward! Coward!" as she was carried back to the van in which they lived. </span>
<span sid='29182' title='29182'>It was six months before she was fit to give evidence, but the inquest was duly held with the obvious verdict of death from misadventure.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29183' title='29183'>'What alternative could be conceived?' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29184' title='29184'>'You may well say so. </span>
<span sid='29185' title='29185'>And yet there were one or two points which worried young Edmunds, of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Berkshire&t=h'>Berkshire</a> Constabulary. </span>
<span sid='29186' title='29186'>A smart lad that! </span>
<span sid='29187' title='29187'>He was sent later to Allahabad. </span>
<span sid='29188' title='29188'>That was how I came into the matter, for he dropped in and smoked a pipe or two over it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29189' title='29189'>'A thin, yellow-haired man?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29190' title='29190'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='29191' title='29191'>I was sure you would pick up the trail presently.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29192' title='29192'>'But what worried him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29193' title='29193'>'Well, we were both worried. </span>
<span sid='29194' title='29194'>It was so deucedly difficult to reconstruct the affair. </span>
<span sid='29195' title='29195'>Look at it from the lion's point of view. </span>
<span sid='29196' title='29196'>He is liberated. </span>
<span sid='29197' title='29197'>What does he do? </span>
<span sid='29198' title='29198'>He takes half a dozen bounds forward, which brings him to Ronder. </span>
<span sid='29199' title='29199'>Ronder turns to fly - the claw-marks were on the back of his head - but the lion strikes him down. </span>
<span sid='29200' title='29200'>Then, instead of bounding on and escaping, he returns to the woman, who was close to the cage, and he knocks her over and chews her face up. </span>
<span sid='29201' title='29201'>Then, again, those cries of hers would seem to imply that her husband had in some way failed her. </span>
<span sid='29202' title='29202'>What could the poor devil have done to help her? </span>
<span sid='29203' title='29203'>You see the difficulty?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29204' title='29204'>'Quite.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29205' title='29205'>'And then there was another thing. </span>
<span sid='29206' title='29206'>It comes back to me now as I think it over. </span>
<span sid='29207' title='29207'>There was some evidence that, just at the time the lion roared and the woman screamed, a man began shouting in terror.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29208' title='29208'>'This man Ronder, no doubt.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29209' title='29209'>'Well, if his skull was smashed in you would hardly expect to hear from him again. </span>
<span sid='29210' title='29210'>There were at least two witnesses who spoke of the cries of a man being mingled with those of a woman.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29211' title='29211'>'I should think the whole camp was crying out by then. </span>
<span sid='29212' title='29212'>As to the other points, I think I could suggest a solution.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29213' title='29213'>'I should be glad to consider it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29214' title='29214'>'The two were together, ten yards from the cage, when the lion got loose. </span>
<span sid='29215' title='29215'>The man turned and was struck down. </span>
<span sid='29216' title='29216'>The woman conceived the idea of getting into the cage and shutting the door. </span>
<span sid='29217' title='29217'>It was her only refuge. </span>
<span sid='29218' title='29218'>She made for it, and just as she reached it the beast bounded after her and knocked her over. </span>
<span sid='29219' title='29219'>She was angry with her husband for having encouraged the beast's rage by turning. </span>
<span sid='29220' title='29220'>If they had faced it, they might have cowed it. </span>
<span sid='29221' title='29221'>Hence her cries of "Coward!"'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29222' title='29222'>'Brilliant, Watson! </span>
<span sid='29223' title='29223'>Only one flaw in your diamond.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29224' title='29224'>'What is the flaw, Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29225' title='29225'>'If they were both ten paces from the cage, how came the beast to get loose?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29226' title='29226'>'Is it possible that they had some enemy who loosed it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29227' title='29227'>'And why should it attack them savagely when it was in the habit of playing with them, and doing tricks with them inside the cage?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29228' title='29228'>'Possibly the same enemy had done something to enrage it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29229' title='29229'>Holmes looked thoughtful and remained in silence for some moments.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29230' title='29230'>'Well, Watson, there is this to be said for your theory. </span>
<span sid='29231' title='29231'>Ronder was a man of many enemies. </span>
<span sid='29232' title='29232'>Edmunds told me that in his cups he was horrible. </span>
<span sid='29233' title='29233'>A huge bully of a man, he cursed and slashed at everyone who came in his way. </span>
<span sid='29234' title='29234'>I expect those cries about a monster, of which our visitor has spoken, were nocturnal reminiscences of the dear departed. </span>
<span sid='29235' title='29235'>However, our speculations are futile until we have all the facts. </span>
<span sid='29236' title='29236'>There is a cold partridge on the sideboard, Watson, and a bottle of Montrachet. </span>
<span sid='29237' title='29237'>Let us renew our energies before we make a fresh call upon them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29238' title='29238'>When our hansom deposited us at the house of Mrs Merrilow, we found that plump lady blocking up the open door of her humble but retired abode. </span>
<span sid='29239' title='29239'>It was very clear that her chief preoccupation was lest she should lose a valuable lodger, and she implored us, before showing us up, to say and do nothing which could lead to so undesirable an end. </span>
<span sid='29240' title='29240'>Then, having reassured her, we followed her up the straight badly-carpeted staircase and were shown into the room of the mysterious lodger.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29241' title='29241'>It was a close, musty, ill-ventilated place, as might be expected, since its inmate seldom left it. </span>
<span sid='29242' title='29242'>From keeping beasts in a cage, the woman seemed, by some retribution of Fate, to have become herself a beast in a cage. </span>
<span sid='29243' title='29243'>She sat now in a broken arm-chair in the shadowy corner of the room. </span>
<span sid='29244' title='29244'>Long years of inaction had coarsened the lines of her figure, but at some period it must have been beautiful, and was still full and voluptuous. </span>
<span sid='29245' title='29245'>A thick dark veil covered her face, but it was cut off close at her upper lip, and disclosed a perfectly-shaped mouth and a delicately-rounded chin. </span>
<span sid='29246' title='29246'>I could well conceive that she had indeed been a very remarkable woman. </span>
<span sid='29247' title='29247'>Her voice, too, was well-modulated and pleasing.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29248' title='29248'>'My name is not unfamiliar to you, Mr Holmes,' said she. </span>
<span sid='29249' title='29249'>'I thought that it would bring you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29250' title='29250'>'That is so, madam, though I do not know how you are aware that I was interested in your case.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29251' title='29251'>'I learned it when I had recovered my health and was examined by Mr Edmunds, the County detective. </span>
<span sid='29252' title='29252'>I fear I lied to him. </span>
<span sid='29253' title='29253'>Perhaps it would have been wiser had I told the truth.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29254' title='29254'>'It is usually wiser to tell the truth. </span>
<span sid='29255' title='29255'>But why did you lie to him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29256' title='29256'>'Because the fate of someone else depended upon it. </span>
<span sid='29257' title='29257'>I know that he was a very worthless being, and yet I would not have his destruction upon my conscience. </span>
<span sid='29258' title='29258'>We had been so close - so close!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29259' title='29259'>'But has this impediment been removed?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29260' title='29260'>'Yes, sir. </span>
<span sid='29261' title='29261'>The person that I allude to is dead.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29262' title='29262'>'Then why should you not now tell the police anything you know?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29263' title='29263'>'Because there is another person to be considered. </span>
<span sid='29264' title='29264'>That other person is myself. </span>
<span sid='29265' title='29265'>I could not stand the scandal and publicity which would come from a police examination. </span>
<span sid='29266' title='29266'>I have not long to live, but I wish to die undisturbed. </span>
<span sid='29267' title='29267'>And yet I wanted to find one man of judgement to whom I could tell my terrible story, so that when I am gone all might be understood.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29268' title='29268'>'You compliment me, madam. </span>
<span sid='29269' title='29269'>At the same time, I am a responsible person. </span>
<span sid='29270' title='29270'>I do not promise you that when you have spoken I may not myself think it my duty to refer the case to the police.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29271' title='29271'>'I think not, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='29272' title='29272'>I know your character and methods too well, for I have followed your work for some years. </span>
<span sid='29273' title='29273'><a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Reading&t=h'>Reading</a> is the only pleasure which Fate has left me, and I miss little which passes in the world. </span>
<span sid='29274' title='29274'>But in any case, I will take my chance of the use which you may make of my tragedy. </span>
<span sid='29275' title='29275'>It will ease my mind to tell it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29276' title='29276'>'My friend and I would be glad to hear it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29277' title='29277'>The woman rose and took from a drawer the photograph of a man. </span>
<span sid='29278' title='29278'>He was clearly a professional acrobat, a man of magnificent physique, taken with his huge arms folded across his swollen chest and a smile breaking from under his heavy moustache - the self-satisfied smile of the man of many conquests.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29279' title='29279'>'That is Leonardo,' she said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29280' title='29280'>'Leonardo, the strong man, who gave evidence?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29281' title='29281'>'The same. </span>
<span sid='29282' title='29282'>And this - this is my husband.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29283' title='29283'>It was a dreadful face - a human pig, or rather a human wild boar, for it was formidable in its bestiality. </span>
<span sid='29284' title='29284'>One could imagine that vile mouth champing and foaming in its rage, and one could conceive those small, vicious eyes darting pure malignancy as they looked forth upon the world. </span>
<span sid='29285' title='29285'>Ruffian, bully, beast - it was all written on that heavy-jowled face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29286' title='29286'>'Those two pictures will help you, gentlemen, to understand the story. </span>
<span sid='29287' title='29287'>I was a poor circus girl brought up on the sawdust, and doing springs through the hoop before I was ten. </span>
<span sid='29288' title='29288'>When I became a woman this man loved me, if such lust as his can be called love, and in an evil moment I became his wife. </span>
<span sid='29289' title='29289'>From that day I was in hell, and he the devil who tormented me. </span>
<span sid='29290' title='29290'>There was no one in the show who did not know of this treatment. </span>
<span sid='29291' title='29291'>He deserted me for others. </span>
<span sid='29292' title='29292'>He tied me down and lashed me with his riding-whip when I complained. </span>
<span sid='29293' title='29293'>They all pitied me and they all loathed him, but what could they do? </span>
<span sid='29294' title='29294'>They feared him, one and all. </span>
<span sid='29295' title='29295'>For he was terrible at all times, and murderous when he was drunk. </span>
<span sid='29296' title='29296'>Again and again he was had for assault, and for cruelty to the beasts, but he had plenty of money, and the fines were nothing to him. </span>
<span sid='29297' title='29297'>The best men all left us, and the show began to go downhill. </span>
<span sid='29298' title='29298'>It was only Leonardo and I who kept it up - with little Jimmy Griggs, the clown. </span>
<span sid='29299' title='29299'>Poor devil, he had not much to be funny about, but he did what he could to hold things together.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29300' title='29300'>'Then Leonardo came more and more into my life. </span>
<span sid='29301' title='29301'>You see what he was like. </span>
<span sid='29302' title='29302'>I know now the poor spirit that was hidden in that splendid body, but compared to my husband he seemed like the Angel Gabriel. </span>
<span sid='29303' title='29303'>He pitied me and helped me, till at last our intimacy turned to love - deep, deep, passionate love, such love as I had dreamed of, but never hoped to feel. </span>
<span sid='29304' title='29304'>My husband suspected it, but I think that he was a coward as well as a bully, and that Leonardo was the one man that he was afraid of. </span>
<span sid='29305' title='29305'>He took revenge in his own way by torturing me more than ever. </span>
<span sid='29306' title='29306'>One night my cries brought Leonardo to the door of our van. </span>
<span sid='29307' title='29307'>We were near tragedy that night, and soon my lover and I understood that it could not be avoided. </span>
<span sid='29308' title='29308'>My husband was not fit to live. </span>
<span sid='29309' title='29309'>We planned that he should die.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29310' title='29310'>'Leonardo had a clever, scheming brain. </span>
<span sid='29311' title='29311'>It was he who planned it. </span>
<span sid='29312' title='29312'>I do not say that to blame him, for I was ready to go with him every inch of the way. </span>
<span sid='29313' title='29313'>But I should never have had the wit to think of such a plan. </span>
<span sid='29314' title='29314'>We made a club - Leonardo made it - and in the leaden head he fastened five long steel nails, the points outwards, with just such a spread as the lion's paw. </span>
<span sid='29315' title='29315'>This was to give my husband his death-blow, and yet to leave the evidence that it was the lion which we would loose who had done the deed. </span>
<span sid='29316' title='29316'>'It was a pitch-dark night when my husband and I went down, as was our custom, to feed the beast. </span>
<span sid='29317' title='29317'>We carried with us the raw meat in a zinc pail. </span>
<span sid='29318' title='29318'>Leonardo was waiting at the corner of the big van which we should have to pass before we reached the cage. </span>
<span sid='29319' title='29319'>He was too slow, and we walked past him before he could strike, but he followed us on tiptoe and I heard the crash as the club smashed my husband's skull. </span>
<span sid='29320' title='29320'>My heart leaped with joy at the sound. </span>
<span sid='29321' title='29321'>I sprang forward, and I undid the catch which held the door of the great lion's cage.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29322' title='29322'>'And then the terrible thing happened. </span>
<span sid='29323' title='29323'>You may have heard how quick these creatures are to scent human blood, and how it excites them. </span>
<span sid='29324' title='29324'>Some strange instinct had told the creature in one instant that a human being had been slain. </span>
<span sid='29325' title='29325'>As I slipped the bars it bounded out, and was on me in an instant. </span>
<span sid='29326' title='29326'>Leonardo could have saved me. </span>
<span sid='29327' title='29327'>If he had rushed forward and struck the beast with his club he might have cowed it. </span>
<span sid='29328' title='29328'>But the man lost his nerve. </span>
<span sid='29329' title='29329'>I heard him shout in his terror, and then I saw him turn and fly. </span>
<span sid='29330' title='29330'>At the same instant the teeth of the lion met in my face. </span>
<span sid='29331' title='29331'>Its hot, filthy breath had already poisoned me and I was hardly conscious of pain. </span>
<span sid='29332' title='29332'>With the palms of my hands I tried to push the great steaming, blood-stained jaws away from me, and I screamed for help. </span>
<span sid='29333' title='29333'>I was conscious that the camp was stirring, and then dimly I remember a group of men, Leonardo, Griggs, and others, dragging me from under the creature's paws. </span>
<span sid='29334' title='29334'>That was my last memory, Mr Holmes, for many a weary month. </span>
<span sid='29335' title='29335'>When I came to myself, and saw myself in the mirror, I cursed that lion - oh, how I cursed him! - not because he had torn away my beauty, but because he had not torn away my life. </span>
<span sid='29336' title='29336'>I had but one desire, Mr Holmes, and I had enough money to gratify it. </span>
<span sid='29337' title='29337'>It was that I should cover myself so that my poor face should be seen by none, and that I should dwell where none whom I had ever known should find me. </span>
<span sid='29338' title='29338'>That was all that was left to me to do - and that is what I have done. </span>
<span sid='29339' title='29339'>A poor wounded beast that has crawled into its hole to die - that is the end of Eugenia Ronder.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29340' title='29340'>We sat in silence for some time after the unhappy woman had told her story. </span>
<span sid='29341' title='29341'>Then Holmes stretched out his long arm and patted her hand with such a show of sympathy as I had seldom known him to exhibit.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29342' title='29342'>'Poor girl!' he said. </span>
<span sid='29343' title='29343'>'Poor girl! </span>
<span sid='29344' title='29344'>The ways of Fate are indeed hard to understand. </span>
<span sid='29345' title='29345'>If there is not some compensation hereafter, then the world is a cruel jest. </span>
<span sid='29346' title='29346'>But what of this man Leonardo?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29347' title='29347'>'I never saw him or heard from him again. </span>
<span sid='29348' title='29348'>Perhaps I have been wrong to feel so bitterly against him. </span>
<span sid='29349' title='29349'>He might as soon have loved one of the freaks whom we carried round the country as the thing which the lion had left. </span>
<span sid='29350' title='29350'>But a woman's love is not so easily set aside. </span>
<span sid='29351' title='29351'>He had left me under the beast's claws, he had deserted me in my need, and yet I could not bring myself to give him to the gallows. </span>
<span sid='29352' title='29352'>For myself, I cared nothing what became of me. </span>
<span sid='29353' title='29353'>What could be more dreadful than my actual life? </span>
<span sid='29354' title='29354'>But I stood between Leonardo and his fate.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29355' title='29355'>'And he is dead?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29356' title='29356'>'He was drowned last month when bathing near <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Margate&t=h'>Margate</a>. </span>
<span sid='29357' title='29357'>I saw his death in the paper.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29358' title='29358'>'And what did he do with this five-clawed club, which is the most singular and ingenious part of all your story?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29359' title='29359'>'I cannot tell, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='29360' title='29360'>There is a chalk-pit by the camp, with a deep green pool at the base of it. </span>
<span sid='29361' title='29361'>Perhaps in the depths of that pool-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29362' title='29362'>'Well, well, it is of little consequence now. </span>
<span sid='29363' title='29363'>The case is closed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29364' title='29364'>'Yes,' said the woman, 'the case is closed.' </span>
<span sid='29365' title='29365'>We had risen to go, but there was something in the woman's voice which arrested Holmes's attention. </span>
<span sid='29366' title='29366'>He turned swiftly upon her.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29367' title='29367'>'Your life is not your own,' he said. </span>
<span sid='29368' title='29368'>'Keep your hands off it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29369' title='29369'>'What use is it to anyone?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29370' title='29370'>'How can you tell? </span>
<span sid='29371' title='29371'>The example of patient suffering is in itself the most precious of all lessons to an impatient world.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29372' title='29372'>The woman's answer was a terrible one. </span>
<span sid='29373' title='29373'>She raised her veil and stepped forward into the light.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29374' title='29374'>'I wonder if you would bear it,' she said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29375' title='29375'>It was horrible. </span>
<span sid='29376' title='29376'>No words can describe the framework of a face when the face itself is gone. </span>
<span sid='29377' title='29377'>Two living and beautiful brown eyes looking sadly out from that grisly ruin did but make the view more awful. </span>
<span sid='29378' title='29378'>Holmes held up his hand in a gesture of pity and protest, and together we left the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29379' title='29379'>Two days later, when I called upon my friend, he pointed with some pride to a small blue bottle upon his mantelpiece. </span>
<span sid='29380' title='29380'>I picked it up. </span>
<span sid='29381' title='29381'>There was a red poison label. </span>
<span sid='29382' title='29382'>A pleasant almondy odour rose when I opened it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29383' title='29383'>'Prussic acid?' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29384' title='29384'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='29385' title='29385'>It came by post. </span>
<span sid='29386' title='29386'>"I send you my temptation. </span>
<span sid='29387' title='29387'>I will follow your advice." </span>
<span sid='29388' title='29388'>That was the message. </span>
<span sid='29389' title='29389'>I think, Watson, we can guess the name of the brave woman who sent it.'</span>
