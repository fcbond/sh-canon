<h1><span sid='27862' title='27862'>The Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez</span></h1>
<p class="subtitle">Arthur Conan Doyle<label for="sn-meta-gold" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-meta-gold" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><!--googleoff: all--><b>Story Number</b>: 37<br><b>Published in</b>: The Strand Magazine in July 1904<br><b>Collected in</b>: The Return of Sherlock Holmes<!--googleon: all--></span></p>
<p>
<span sid='27863' title='27863'>When I look at the three massive manuscript volumes which contain our work for the year 1894 I confess that it is very difficult for me, out of such a wealth of material, to select the cases which are most interesting in themselves and at the same time most conducive to a display of those peculiar powers for which my friend was famous. </span>
<span sid='27864' title='27864'>As I turn over the pages I see my notes upon the repulsive story of the red leech and the terrible death of Crosby the banker. </span>
<span sid='27865' title='27865'>Here also I find an account of the Addleton tragedy and the singular contents of the ancient British barrow. </span>
<span sid='27866' title='27866'>The famous Smith-Mortimer succession case comes also within this period, and so does the tracking and arrest of Huret, the Boulevard assassin - an exploit which won for Holmes an autograph letter of thanks from the French President and the Order of the Legion of Honour. </span>
<span sid='27867' title='27867'>Each of these would furnish a narrative, but on the whole I am of opinion that none of them unite so many singular points of interest as the episode of Yoxley Old Place, which includes, not only the lamentable death of young Willoughby Smith, but also those subsequent developments which threw so curious a light upon the causes of the crime.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27868' title='27868'>It was a wild, tempestuous night towards the close of November. </span>
<span sid='27869' title='27869'>Holmes and I sat together in silence all the evening, he engaged with a powerful lens deciphering the remains of the original inscription upon a palimpsest, I deep in a recent treatise upon surgery. </span>
<span sid='27870' title='27870'>Outside the wind howled down <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>, while the rain beat fiercely against the windows. </span>
<span sid='27871' title='27871'>It was strange there in the very depths of the town, with ten miles of man's handiwork on every side of us, to feel the iron grip of Nature, and to be conscious that to the huge elemental forces all <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> was no more than the molehills that dot the fields. </span>
<span sid='27872' title='27872'>I walked to the window and looked out on the deserted street. </span>
<span sid='27873' title='27873'>The occasional lamps gleamed on the expanse of muddy road and shining pavement. </span>
<span sid='27874' title='27874'>A single cab was splashing its way from the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Oxford Street&t=h'>Oxford Street</a> end.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27875' title='27875'>'Well, Watson, it's as well we have not to turn out to-night,' said Holmes, laying aside his lens and rolling up the Palimpsest. </span>
<span sid='27876' title='27876'>'I've done enough for one sitting. </span>
<span sid='27877' title='27877'>It is trying work for the eyes. </span>
<span sid='27878' title='27878'>So far as I can make out, it is nothing more exciting than an Abbey's accounts dating from the second half of the fifteenth century. </span>
<span sid='27879' title='27879'>Hullo! hullo! hullo! </span>
<span sid='27880' title='27880'>What's this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27881' title='27881'>Amid the droning of the wind there had come the stamping of a horse's hoofs and the long grind of a wheel as it rasped against the kerb. </span>
<span sid='27882' title='27882'>The cab which I had seen had pulled up at our door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27883' title='27883'>'What can he want?' I ejaculated, as a man stepped out of it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27884' title='27884'>'Want! </span>
<span sid='27885' title='27885'>He wants us. </span>
<span sid='27886' title='27886'>And we, my poor Watson, want overcoats and cravats and goloshes, and every aid that man ever invented to fight the weather. </span>
<span sid='27887' title='27887'>Wait a bit, though! </span>
<span sid='27888' title='27888'>There's the cab off again! </span>
<span sid='27889' title='27889'>There's hope yet. </span>
<span sid='27890' title='27890'>He'd have kept it if he had wanted us to come. </span>
<span sid='27891' title='27891'>Run down, my dear fellow, and open the door, for all virtuous folk have been long in bed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27892' title='27892'>When the light of the hall lamp fell upon our midnight visitor, I had no difficulty in recognizing him. </span>
<span sid='27893' title='27893'>It was young Stanley Hopkins, a promising detective, in whose career Holmes had several times shown a very practical interest.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27894' title='27894'>'Is he in?' he asked eagerly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27895' title='27895'>'Come up, my dear sir,' said Holmes's voice from above. </span>
<span sid='27896' title='27896'>'I hope you have no designs upon us on such a night as this.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27897' title='27897'>The detective mounted the stairs, and our lamp gleamed upon his shining waterproof. </span>
<span sid='27898' title='27898'>I helped him out of it, while Holmes knocked a blaze out of the logs in the grate.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27899' title='27899'>Now, my dear Hopkins, draw up and warm your toes,' said he. </span>
<span sid='27900' title='27900'>'Here's a cigar, and the doctor has a prescription containing hot water and a lemon which is good medicine on a night like this. </span>
<span sid='27901' title='27901'>It must be something important which has brought you out in such a gale.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27902' title='27902'>'It is indeed, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='27903' title='27903'>I've had a bustling afternoon, I promise you. </span>
<span sid='27904' title='27904'>Did you see anything of the Yoxley case in the latest editions?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27905' title='27905'>'I've seen nothing later than the fifteenth century to-day.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27906' title='27906'>'Well, it was only a paragraph, and all wrong at that, so you have not missed anything. </span>
<span sid='27907' title='27907'>I haven't let the grass grow under my feet. </span>
<span sid='27908' title='27908'>It's down in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kent&t=h'>Kent</a>, seven miles from Chatham and three from the railway line. </span>
<span sid='27909' title='27909'>I was wired for at three-fifteen, reached Yoxley Old Place at five, conducted my investigation, was back at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Charing Cross&t=h'>Charing Cross</a> by the last train and straight to you by cab.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27910' title='27910'>'Which means, I suppose, that you are not quite clear about your case?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27911' title='27911'>'It means that I can make neither head nor tail of it. </span>
<span sid='27912' title='27912'>So far as I can see, it is just as tangled a business as ever I handled, and yet at first it seemed so simple that one couldn't go wrong. </span>
<span sid='27913' title='27913'>There's no motive, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='27914' title='27914'>That's what bothers me - I can't put my hand on a motive. </span>
<span sid='27915' title='27915'>Here's a man dead - there's no denying that - but, so far as I can see, no reason on earth why anyone should wish him harm.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27916' title='27916'>Holmes lit his cigar and leaned back in his chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27917' title='27917'>'Let us hear about it,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27918' title='27918'>'I've got my facts pretty clear,' said Stanley Hopkins. </span>
<span sid='27919' title='27919'>'All I want now is to know what they all mean. </span>
<span sid='27920' title='27920'>The story, so far as I can make it out, is like this. </span>
<span sid='27921' title='27921'>Some years ago this country house, Yoxley Old Place, was taken by an elderly man, who gave the name of Professor Coram. </span>
<span sid='27922' title='27922'>He was an invalid, keeping his bed half the time, and the other half hobbling round the house with a stick, or being pushed about the grounds by the gardener in a bath-chair. </span>
<span sid='27923' title='27923'>He was well liked by the few neighbours who called upon him, and he has the reputation down there of being a very learned man. </span>
<span sid='27924' title='27924'>His household used to consist of an elderly housekeeper, Mrs Marker, and of a maid, Susan Tarlton. </span>
<span sid='27925' title='27925'>These have both been with him since his arrival, and they seem to be women of excellent character. </span>
<span sid='27926' title='27926'>The professor is writing a learned book, and he found it necessary about a year ago to engage a secretary. </span>
<span sid='27927' title='27927'>The first two that he tried were not successes; but the third, Mr Willoughby Smith, a very young man straight from the University, seems to have been just what his employer wanted. </span>
<span sid='27928' title='27928'>His work consisted in writing all the morning to the Professor's dictation, and he usually pent the evening in hunting up references and passages which bore upon the next day's work. </span>
<span sid='27929' title='27929'>This Willoughby Smith has nothing against him either as a boy at Uppingham or as a young man at Cambridge. </span>
<span sid='27930' title='27930'>I have seen his testimonials, and from the first he was a decent, quiet, hard-working fellow, with no weak spot in him at all. </span>
<span sid='27931' title='27931'>And vet this is the lad who has met his death this morning in the Professor's study under circumstances which can point only to murder.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27932' title='27932'>The wind howled and screamed at the windows. </span>
<span sid='27933' title='27933'>Holmes and I drew closer to the fire while the young inspector slowly and point by point developed his singular narrative.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27934' title='27934'>'If you were to search all <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>,' said he, 'I don't suppose you could find a household more self-contained or tree from outside influences. </span>
<span sid='27935' title='27935'>Whole weeks would pass and not one of them go past the garden gate. </span>
<span sid='27936' title='27936'>The Professor was buried in his work and existed for nothing else. </span>
<span sid='27937' title='27937'>Young Smith knew nobody in the neighbourhood, and lived very much as his employer did. </span>
<span sid='27938' title='27938'>The two women had nothing to take them from the house. </span>
<span sid='27939' title='27939'>Mortimer, the gardener, who wheels the bath-chair, is an Army pensioner - an old <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Crimea&t=h'>Crimea</a>n man of excellent character. </span>
<span sid='27940' title='27940'>He does not live in the house, but in a three-roomed cottage at the other end of the garden. </span>
<span sid='27941' title='27941'>Those are the only people that you would find within the grounds of Yoxley Old Place. </span>
<span sid='27942' title='27942'>At the same time, the gate of the garden is a hundred yards from the main <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> to Chatham road. </span>
<span sid='27943' title='27943'>It opens with a latch, and there is nothing to prevent anyone from walking in.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27944' title='27944'>Now I will give you the evidence of Susan Tarlton, who is the only person who can say anything positive about the matter. </span>
<span sid='27945' title='27945'>It was in the forenoon, between eleven and twelve. </span>
<span sid='27946' title='27946'>She was engaged at the moment in hanging some curtains in the upstairs front bedroom. </span>
<span sid='27947' title='27947'>Professor Coram was still in bed, for when the weather is bad he seldom rises before midday. </span>
<span sid='27948' title='27948'>The housekeeper was busied with some work in the back of the house. </span>
<span sid='27949' title='27949'>Willoughby Smith had been in his bedroom, which he uses as a sitting-room; but the maid heard him at that moment pass along the passage and descend to the study immediately below her. </span>
<span sid='27950' title='27950'>She did not see him, but she says that she could not be mistaken in his quick, firm tread. </span>
<span sid='27951' title='27951'>She did not hear the study door close, but a minute or so later there was a dreadful cry in the room below. </span>
<span sid='27952' title='27952'>It was a wild, hoarse scream, so strange and unnatural that it might have come either from a man or a woman. </span>
<span sid='27953' title='27953'>At the same instant there was a heavy thud, which shook the whole house, and then all was silence. </span>
<span sid='27954' title='27954'>The maid stood petrified for a moment, and then, recovering her courage, she ran downstairs. </span>
<span sid='27955' title='27955'>The study door was shut, and she opened it. </span>
<span sid='27956' title='27956'>Inside young Mr Willoughby Smith was stretched upon the floor. </span>
<span sid='27957' title='27957'>At first she could see no injury, but as she tried to raise him she saw that blood was pouring from the under side of his neck. </span>
<span sid='27958' title='27958'>It was pierced by a very small but very deep wound, which had divided the carotid artery. </span>
<span sid='27959' title='27959'>The instrument with which the injury had been inflicted lay upon the carpet beside him. </span>
<span sid='27960' title='27960'>It was one of those small sealing-wax knives to be found on old-fashioned writing- tables, with an ivory handle and a stiff blade. </span>
<span sid='27961' title='27961'>It was part of the fittings of the Professor's own desk.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27962' title='27962'>'At first the maid thought that young Smith was already dead, but on pouring some water from the carafe over his forehead, he opened his eyes for an instant. </span>
<span sid='27963' title='27963'>"The Professor," he murmured - "it was she." </span>
<span sid='27964' title='27964'>The maid is prepared to swear that those were the exact words. </span>
<span sid='27965' title='27965'>He tried desperately to say something else, and he held his right hand up in the air. </span>
<span sid='27966' title='27966'>Then he fell back dead.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27967' title='27967'>'In the meantime the housekeeper had also arrived upon the scene, but she was just too late to catch the young man's dying words. </span>
<span sid='27968' title='27968'>Leaving Susan with the body, she hurried to the Professor's room. </span>
<span sid='27969' title='27969'>He was sitting up in bed, horribly agitated, for he had heard enough to convince him that something terrible had occurred. </span>
<span sid='27970' title='27970'>Mrs Marker is prepared to swear that the Professor was still in his night-clothes, and, indeed, it was impossible for him to dress without the help of Mortimer, whose orders were to come at twelve o'clock. </span>
<span sid='27971' title='27971'>The Professor declares that he heard the distant cry, but that he knows nothing more. </span>
<span sid='27972' title='27972'>He can give no explanation of the young man's last words, "The Professor - it was she," but imagines that they were the outcome of delirium. </span>
<span sid='27973' title='27973'>He believes that Willoughby Smith had not an enemy in the world, and can give no reason for the crime. </span>
<span sid='27974' title='27974'>His first action was to send Mortimer, the gardener, for the local police. </span>
<span sid='27975' title='27975'>A little later the chief constable sent for me. </span>
<span sid='27976' title='27976'>Nothing was moved before I got there, and strict orders were given that no one should walk upon the paths leading to the house. </span>
<span sid='27977' title='27977'>It was a splendid chance of putting your theories into practice, Mr Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='27978' title='27978'>There was really nothing wanting.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27979' title='27979'>'Except Mr Sherlock Holmes!' said my companion, with a somewhat bitter smile. </span>
<span sid='27980' title='27980'>'Well, let us hear about it. </span>
<span sid='27981' title='27981'>What sort of job did you make of it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27982' title='27982'>'I must ask you first, Mr Holmes, to glance at this rough plan, which will give you a general idea of the position of the Professor's study and the various points of the case. </span>
<span sid='27983' title='27983'>It will help you in following my investigations.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27984' title='27984'>He unfolded the rough chart, which I here reproduce, and he laid it across Holmes's knee. </span>
<span sid='27985' title='27985'>I rose, and, standing behind Holmes, I studied it over his shoulder.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27986' title='27986'>'It is very rough, of course, and it only deals with the points which seem to me to be essential. </span>
<span sid='27987' title='27987'>All the rest you will see later for yourself. </span>
<span sid='27988' title='27988'>Now, first of all, presuming that the assassin entered the house, how did he or she come in? </span>
<span sid='27989' title='27989'>Undoubtedly by the garden path and the back door, from which there is direct access to the study. </span>
<span sid='27990' title='27990'>Any other way would have been exceedingly complicated. </span>
<span sid='27991' title='27991'>The escape must also have been made along that line, for of the two other exits from the room one was blocked by Susan as she ran downstairs, and the other leads straight to the Professor's bedroom. </span>
<span sid='27992' title='27992; #<img src=""images/GOLD.jpg"" border=""0"" />''>I therefore directed my attention at once to the garden path, which was saturated with recent rain and would certainly show any footmarks.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27993' title='27993'>'My examination showed me that I was dealing with a cautious and expert criminal. </span>
<span sid='27994' title='27994'>No footmarks were to be found on the path. </span>
<span sid='27995' title='27995'>There could be no question, however, that someone had passed along the grass border which lines the path, and that he had done so in order to avoid leaving a track. </span>
<span sid='27996' title='27996'>I could not find anything in the nature of a distinct impression, but the grass was trodden down and someone had undoubtedly passed. </span>
<span sid='27997' title='27997'>It could only have been the murderer, since neither the gardener nor anyone else had been there that morning, and the rain had only begun during the night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27998' title='27998'>'One moment,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='27999' title='27999'>'Where does this path lead to?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28000' title='28000'>'To the road.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28001' title='28001'>'How long is it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28002' title='28002'>'A hundred yards or so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28003' title='28003'>'At the point where the path passes through the gate you could surely pick up the tracks?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28004' title='28004'>'Unfortunately the path was tiled at that point.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28005' title='28005'>'Well, on the road itself?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28006' title='28006'>'No; it was all trodden into mire.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28007' title='28007'>'Tut! tut! </span>
<span sid='28008' title='28008'>Well, then, these tracks upon the grass, were they coming or going?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28009' title='28009'>'It was impossible to say. </span>
<span sid='28010' title='28010'>There was never any outline.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28011' title='28011'>'A large foot or a small?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28012' title='28012'>'You could not distinguish.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28013' title='28013'>Holmes gave an ejaculation of impatience. </span>
<span sid='28014' title='28014'>'It has been pouring rain and blowing a hurricane ever since,' said he. </span>
<span sid='28015' title='28015'>'It will be harder to read now than that palimpsest. </span>
<span sid='28016' title='28016'>Well, well, it can't be helped. </span>
<span sid='28017' title='28017'>What did you do, Hopkins, after you had made certain that you had made certain of nothing?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28018' title='28018'>'I think I made certain of a good deal, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='28019' title='28019'>I knew that someone had entered the house cautiously from without. </span>
<span sid='28020' title='28020'>I next examined the corridor. </span>
<span sid='28021' title='28021'>It is lined with coconut matting, and had taken no impression of any kind. </span>
<span sid='28022' title='28022'>This brought me into the study itself. </span>
<span sid='28023' title='28023'>It is a scantily furnished room. </span>
<span sid='28024' title='28024'>The main article is a large writing-table with a fixed bureau. </span>
<span sid='28025' title='28025'>This bureau consists of a double column of drawers with a central small cupboard between them. </span>
<span sid='28026' title='28026'>The drawers were open, the cupboard locked. </span>
<span sid='28027' title='28027'>The drawers, it seems, were always open, and nothing of value was kept in them. </span>
<span sid='28028' title='28028'>There were some papers of importance in the cupboard, but there were no signs that this had been tampered with, and the professor assures me that nothing was missing. </span>
<span sid='28029' title='28029'>It is certain that no robbery had been committed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28030' title='28030'>'I come now to the body of the young man. </span>
<span sid='28031' title='28031'>It was found near the bureau, and just to the left of it, as marked upon that chart. </span>
<span sid='28032' title='28032'>The stab was on the right side of the neck and from behind forwards, so that it is almost impossible that it could have been self-inflicted!</span>
<p>
<span sid='28033' title='28033'>'Unless he fell upon the knife,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28034' title='28034'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='28035' title='28035'>The idea crossed my mind. </span>
<span sid='28036' title='28036'>But we found the knife some feet away from the body, so that seems impossible. </span>
<span sid='28037' title='28037'>Then, of course, there are the man's own dying words. </span>
<span sid='28038' title='28038'>And, finally, there was this very important piece of evidence which was found clasped in the dead man's right hand.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28039' title='28039'>From his pocket Stanley Hopkins drew a small paper packet. </span>
<span sid='28040' title='28040'>He unfolded it, and disclosed a golden pince-nez, with two broken ends of black silk cord dangling from the end of it. </span>
<span sid='28041' title='28041'>'Willoughby Smith had excellent sight,' he added. </span>
<span sid='28042' title='28042'>'There can be no question that this was snatched from the face or the person of the assassin.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28043' title='28043'>Sherlock Holmes took the glasses into his hand and examined them with the utmost attention and interest. </span>
<span sid='28044' title='28044'>He held them on his nose, endeavoured to read through them, went to the window and stared up the street with them, looked at them most minutely in the full light of the lamp, and finally, with a chuckle, seated himself at the table and wrote a few lines upon a sheet of paper, which he tossed across to Stanley Hopkins.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28045' title='28045'>'That's the best I can do for you,' said he. </span>
<span sid='28046' title='28046'>'It may prove to be of some use.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28047' title='28047'>The astonished detective read the note aloud. </span>
<span sid='28048' title='28048'>It ran as follows:</span>
<p>
<span sid='28049' title='28049'>Wanted, a woman of good address, attired like a lady. </span>
<span sid='28050' title='28050'>She has a remarkably thick nose, with eyes which are set close upon either side of it. </span>
<span sid='28051' title='28051'>She has a puckered forehead, a peering expression and probably rounded shoulders. </span>
<span sid='28052' title='28052'>There are indications that she has had recourse to an optician at least twice during the last few months. </span>
<span sid='28053' title='28053'>As her glasses are of remarkable strength, and as opticians are not very numerous, there should be no difficulty in tracing her.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28054' title='28054'>Holmes smiled at the astonishment of Hopkins, which must have been reflected upon my features.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28055' title='28055'>'Surely my deductions are simplicity itself,' said he. </span>
<span sid='28056' title='28056'>'It would be difficult to name any articles which afford a finer field for inference than a pair of glasses, especially so remarkable a pair as these. </span>
<span sid='28057' title='28057'>That they belong to a woman I infer from their delicacy, and also, of course, from the last words of the dying man. </span>
<span sid='28058' title='28058'>As to her being a person of refinement and well dressed, they are, as you perceive, handsomely mounted in solid gold, and it is inconceivable that anyone who wore such glasses could be slatternly in other respects. </span>
<span sid='28059' title='28059'>You will find that the clips are too wide for your nose, showing that the lady's nose was very broad at the base. </span>
<span sid='28060' title='28060'>This sort of nose is usually a short and coarse one, but there are a sufficient number of exceptions to prevent me from being dogmatic or from insisting upon this point in my description. </span>
<span sid='28061' title='28061'>My own face is a narrow one, and yet I find that I cannot get my eyes into the centre, or near the centre, of these glasses. </span>
<span sid='28062' title='28062'>Therefore, the lady's eyes are set very near to the sides of the nose. </span>
<span sid='28063' title='28063'>You will perceive, Watson, that the glasses are concave and of unusual strength. </span>
<span sid='28064' title='28064'>A lady whose vision has been so extremely contracted all her life is sure to have the physical characteristics of such vision, which are seen in the forehead, the eyelids, and the shoulders.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28065' title='28065'>'Yes,' I said, 'I can follow each of your arguments. </span>
<span sid='28066' title='28066'>I confess, however, that I am unable to understand how you arrive at the double visit to the optician.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28067' title='28067'>Holmes took the glasses into his hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28068' title='28068'>'You will perceive,' he said, 'that the clips are lined with tiny bands of cork to soften the pressure upon the nose. </span>
<span sid='28069' title='28069'>One of these is discoloured and worn to some slight extent, but the other is new. </span>
<span sid='28070' title='28070'>Evidently one has fallen off and been replaced. </span>
<span sid='28071' title='28071'>I should judge that the older of them has not been there more than a few months. </span>
<span sid='28072' title='28072'>They exactly correspond, so I gather that the lady went back to the same establishment for the second.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28073' title='28073'>'By George, it's marvellous!' cried Hopkins, in an ecstasy of admiration. </span>
<span sid='28074' title='28074'>'To think that I had all that evidence in my hand and never knew it! </span>
<span sid='28075' title='28075'>I had intended, however, to go the round of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> opticians.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28076' title='28076'>'Of course you would. </span>
<span sid='28077' title='28077'>Meanwhile, have you anything more to tell us about the case?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28078' title='28078'>'Nothing, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='28079' title='28079'>I think that you know as much as I do now - probably more. </span>
<span sid='28080' title='28080'>We have had inquiries made as to any stranger seen on the country roads or at the railway station. </span>
<span sid='28081' title='28081'>We have heard of none. </span>
<span sid='28082' title='28082'>What beats me is the utter want of all object in the crime. </span>
<span sid='28083' title='28083'>Not a ghost of a motive can anyone suggest.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28084' title='28084'>'Ah! there I am not in a position to help you. </span>
<span sid='28085' title='28085'>But I suppose you want us to come out to-morrow?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28086' title='28086'>'If it is not asking too much, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='28087' title='28087'>There's a train from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Charing Cross&t=h'>Charing Cross</a> to Chatham at six in the morning, and we should be at Yoxley Old Place between eight and nine.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28088' title='28088'>'Then we shall take it. </span>
<span sid='28089' title='28089'>Your case has certainly some features of great interest, and I shall be delighted to look into it. </span>
<span sid='28090' title='28090'>Well, it's nearly one, and we had best get a few hours' sleep. </span>
<span sid='28091' title='28091'>I dare say you can manage all right on the sofa in front of the fire. </span>
<span sid='28092' title='28092'>I'll light my spirit-lamp and give you a cup of coffee before we start.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28093' title='28093'>The gale had blown itself out next day, but it was a bitter morning when we started upon our journey. </span>
<span sid='28094' title='28094'>We saw the cold winter sun rise over the dreary marshes of the Thames and the long, sullen reaches of the river, which I shall ever associate with our pursuit of the Andaman Islander in the earlier days of our career. </span>
<span sid='28095' title='28095'>After a long and weary journey we alighted at a small station some miles from Chatham. </span>
<span sid='28096' title='28096'>While a horse was being put into a trap at the local inn we snatched a hurried breakfast and so we were all ready for business when we at last arrived at Yoxley Old Place. </span>
<span sid='28097' title='28097'>A constable met us at the garden gate.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28098' title='28098'>'Well, Wilson, any news?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28099' title='28099'>'No, sir, nothing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28100' title='28100'>'No reports of any stranger seen?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28101' title='28101'>'No, sir. </span>
<span sid='28102' title='28102'>Down at the station they are certain that no stranger either came or went yesterday.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28103' title='28103'>'Have you had inquiries made at inns and lodgings?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28104' title='28104'>'Yes, sir; there is no one that we cannot account for.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28105' title='28105'>'Well, it's only a reasonable walk to Chatham. </span>
<span sid='28106' title='28106'>Anyone might stay there, or take a train without being observed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28107' title='28107'>This is the garden path of which I spoke, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='28108' title='28108'>I'll pledge my word there was no mark on it yesterday.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28109' title='28109'>'On which side were the marks on the grass?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28110' title='28110'>'This side, sir. </span>
<span sid='28111' title='28111'>This narrow margin of grass between the path and the flower-bed. </span>
<span sid='28112' title='28112'>I can't see the traces now, but they were clear to me then.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28113' title='28113'>'Yes, yes; someone has passed along,' said Holmes, stooping over the grass border. </span>
<span sid='28114' title='28114'>'Our lady must have picked her steps carefully, must she not, since on the one side she would leave a track on the path, and on the other an even clearer one on the soft bed?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28115' title='28115'>'Yes, sir, she must have been a cool hand.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28116' title='28116'>I saw an intent look pass over Holmes's face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28117' title='28117'>'You say that she must have come back this way?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28118' title='28118'>'Yes, sir; there is no other.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28119' title='28119'>'On this strip of grass?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28120' title='28120'>'Certainly, Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28121' title='28121'>'Hum! </span>
<span sid='28122' title='28122'>It was a very remarkable performance - very remarkable. </span>
<span sid='28123' title='28123'>Well, I think we have exhausted the path. </span>
<span sid='28124' title='28124'>Let us go farther. </span>
<span sid='28125' title='28125'>This garden door is usually kept open, I suppose? </span>
<span sid='28126' title='28126'>Then this visitor had nothing to do but to walk in. </span>
<span sid='28127' title='28127'>The idea of murder was not in her mind, or she would have provided herself with some sort of weapon, instead of having to pick this knife off the writing-table. </span>
<span sid='28128' title='28128'>She advanced along this corridor, leaving no traces upon the coconut matting. </span>
<span sid='28129' title='28129'>Then she found herself in this study. </span>
<span sid='28130' title='28130'>How long was she there? </span>
<span sid='28131' title='28131'>We have no means of judging.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28132' title='28132'>'Not more than a few minutes, sir. </span>
<span sid='28133' title='28133'>I forgot to tell you that Mrs Marker, the housekeeper, had been in there tidying not very long before - about a quarter of an hour she says.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28134' title='28134'>'Well, that gives us a limit. </span>
<span sid='28135' title='28135'>Our lady enters this room, and what does she do? </span>
<span sid='28136' title='28136'>She goes over to the writing-table. </span>
<span sid='28137' title='28137'>What for? </span>
<span sid='28138' title='28138'>Not for anything in the drawers. </span>
<span sid='28139' title='28139'>If there had been anything worth her taking it would surely have been locked up. </span>
<span sid='28140' title='28140'>No; it was for something in that wooden bureau. </span>
<span sid='28141' title='28141'>Hullo! what is that scratch upon the face of it? </span>
<span sid='28142' title='28142'>Just hold a match, Watson. </span>
<span sid='28143' title='28143'>Why did you not tell me of this, Hopkins?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28144' title='28144'>The mark which he was examining began upon the brass work on the right-hand side of the keyhole, and extended for about four inches, where it had scratched the varnish from the surface.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28145' title='28145'>'I noticed it, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='28146' title='28146'>But you'll always find scratches round a keyhole.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28147' title='28147'>'This is recent - quite recent. </span>
<span sid='28148' title='28148'>See how the brass shines where it is cut. </span>
<span sid='28149' title='28149'>An old scratch would be the same colour as the surface. </span>
<span sid='28150' title='28150'>Look at it through my lens. </span>
<span sid='28151' title='28151'>There's the varnish, too, like earth on each side of a furrow. </span>
<span sid='28152' title='28152'>Is Mrs Marker there?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28153' title='28153'>A sad-faced, elderly woman came into the room. </span>
<span sid='28154' title='28154'>'Did you dust this bureau yesterday morning?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28155' title='28155'>'Yes, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28156' title='28156'>'Did you notice this scratch?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28157' title='28157'>'No, sir, I did not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28158' title='28158'>'I am sure you did not, for a duster would have swept away these shreds of varnish. </span>
<span sid='28159' title='28159'>Who has the key of this bureau?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28160' title='28160'>'The professor keeps it on his watch-chain.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28161' title='28161'>'Is it a simple key?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28162' title='28162'>'No, sir; it is a Chubb's key.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28163' title='28163'>'Very good. </span>
<span sid='28164' title='28164'>Mrs Marker, you can go. </span>
<span sid='28165' title='28165'>Now we are making a little progress. </span>
<span sid='28166' title='28166'>Our lady enters the room, advances to the bureau, and either opens it or tries to do so. </span>
<span sid='28167' title='28167'>While she is thus engaged young Willoughby Smith enters the room. </span>
<span sid='28168' title='28168'>In her hurry to withdraw the key she makes this scratch upon the door. </span>
<span sid='28169' title='28169'>He seizes her, and she, snatching up the nearest object, which happens to be this knife, strikes at him in order to make him let go his hold. </span>
<span sid='28170' title='28170'>The blow is a fatal one. </span>
<span sid='28171' title='28171'>He falls and she escapes, either with or without the object for which she has come. </span>
<span sid='28172' title='28172'>Is Susan the maid there? </span>
<span sid='28173' title='28173'>Could anyone have got away through that door after the time that you heard the cry, Susan?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28174' title='28174'>'No, sir; it is impossible. </span>
<span sid='28175' title='28175'>Before I got down the stair I'd have seen anyone in the passage. </span>
<span sid='28176' title='28176'>Besides, the door never opened, for I would have heard it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28177' title='28177'>'That settles this exit. </span>
<span sid='28178' title='28178'>Then no doubt the lady went out the way she came. </span>
<span sid='28179' title='28179'>I understand that this other passage leads only to the Professor's room. </span>
<span sid='28180' title='28180'>There is no exit that way?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28181' title='28181'>'No, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28182' title='28182'>'We shall go down it and make the acquaintance of the professor. </span>
<span sid='28183' title='28183'>Hullo, Hopkins! this is very important, very important indeed. </span>
<span sid='28184' title='28184'>The professor's corridor is also lined with coconut matting.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28185' title='28185'>'Well, sir, what of that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28186' title='28186'>'Don't you see any bearing upon the case? </span>
<span sid='28187' title='28187'>Well, well, I don't insist upon it. </span>
<span sid='28188' title='28188'>No doubt I am wrong. </span>
<span sid='28189' title='28189'>And yet it seems to me to be suggestive. </span>
<span sid='28190' title='28190'>Come with me and introduce me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28191' title='28191'>We passed down the passage, which was of the same length as that which led to the garden. </span>
<span sid='28192' title='28192'>At the end was a short flight of steps ending in a door. </span>
<span sid='28193' title='28193'>Our guide knocked, and then ushered us into the Professor's bedroom.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28194' title='28194'>It was a very large chamber, lined with innumerable volumes, which had overflowed from the shelves and lay in piles in the corners, or were stacked all round at the base of the cases. </span>
<span sid='28195' title='28195'>The bed was in the centre of the room, and in it, propped up with pillows, was the owner of the house. </span>
<span sid='28196' title='28196'>I have seldom seen a more remarkable-looking person. </span>
<span sid='28197' title='28197'>It was a gaunt, aquiline face which was turned towards us, with piercing dark eyes, which lurked in deep hollows under overhung and tufted brows. </span>
<span sid='28198' title='28198'>His hair and beard were white, save that the latter was curiously stained with yellow around his mouth. </span>
<span sid='28199' title='28199'>A cigarette glowed amid the tangle of white hair, and the air of the room was fetid with stale tobacco smoke. </span>
<span sid='28200' title='28200'>As he held out his hand to Holmes I perceived that it also was stained yellow with nicotine.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28201' title='28201'>'A smoker, Mr Holmes?' said he, speaking well-chosen English with a curious little mincing accent. </span>
<span sid='28202' title='28202'>'Pray take a cigarette. </span>
<span sid='28203' title='28203'>And you, sir? </span>
<span sid='28204' title='28204'>I can recommend them, for I have them especially prepared by Ionides of Alexandria. </span>
<span sid='28205' title='28205'>He sends me a thousand at a time, and I grieve to say that I have to arrange for a fresh supply every fortnight. </span>
<span sid='28206' title='28206'>Bad, sir, very bad; but an old man has few pleasures. </span>
<span sid='28207' title='28207'>Tobacco and my work - that is all that is left to me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28208' title='28208'>Holmes had lit a cigarette, and was shooting little darting glances all over the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28209' title='28209'>'Tobacco and my work, but now only tobacco,' the old man exclaimed. </span>
<span sid='28210' title='28210'>'Alas! what a fatal interruption! </span>
<span sid='28211' title='28211'>Who could have foreseen such a terrible catastrophe? </span>
<span sid='28212' title='28212'>So estimable a young man! </span>
<span sid='28213' title='28213'>I assure you that after a few months' training he was an admirable assistant. </span>
<span sid='28214' title='28214'>What do you think of the matter, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28215' title='28215'>'I have not yet made up my mind.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28216' title='28216'>'I shall indeed be indebted to you if you can throw a light where all is so dark to us. </span>
<span sid='28217' title='28217'>To a poor bookworm and invalid like myself such a blow is paralysing. </span>
<span sid='28218' title='28218'>I seem to have lost the faculty of thought. </span>
<span sid='28219' title='28219'>But you're a man of action - you are a man of affairs. </span>
<span sid='28220' title='28220'>It is part of the everyday routine of your life. </span>
<span sid='28221' title='28221'>You can preserve your balance in every emergency. </span>
<span sid='28222' title='28222'>We are fortunate indeed in having you at our side.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28223' title='28223'>Holmes was pacing up and down on one side of the room whilst the old Professor was talking. </span>
<span sid='28224' title='28224'>I observed that he was smoking with extraordinary rapidity. </span>
<span sid='28225' title='28225'>It was evident that he shared our host's liking for the fresh Alexandrian cigarettes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28226' title='28226'>'Yes, sir, it is a crushing blow,' said the old man. </span>
<span sid='28227' title='28227'>'That is my magnum opus - the pile of papers on the side-table yonder. </span>
<span sid='28228' title='28228'>It is my analysis of the documents found in the Coptic monasteries of Syria and Egypt, a work which will cut deep at the very foundation of revealed religion. </span>
<span sid='28229' title='28229'>With my enfeebled health I do not know whether I shall ever be able to complete it now that my assistant has been taken from me. </span>
<span sid='28230' title='28230'>Dear me, Mr Holmes; why, you are even a quicker smoker than I am myself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28231' title='28231'>Holmes smiled.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28232' title='28232'>'I am a connoisseur,' said he, taking another cigarette from the box - his fourth - and lighting it from the stub of that which he had finished. </span>
<span sid='28233' title='28233'>'I will not trouble you with any lengthy cross-examination, Professor Coram, since I gather that you were in bed at the time of the crime and could know nothing about it. </span>
<span sid='28234' title='28234'>I would only ask this - What do you imagine that this poor fellow meant by his last words; "The Professor - it was she"?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28235' title='28235'>The Professor shook his head.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28236' title='28236'>'Susan is a country girl,' said he, 'and you know the incredible stupidity of that class. </span>
<span sid='28237' title='28237'>I fancy that the poor fellow murmured some incoherent, delirious words, and that she twisted them into this meaningless message.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28238' title='28238'>'I see. </span>
<span sid='28239' title='28239'>You have no explanation yourself of the tragedy?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28240' title='28240'>'Possibly an accident; possibly - I only breathe it among ourselves - a suicide. </span>
<span sid='28241' title='28241'>Young men have their hidden troubles - some affair of the heart, perhaps, which we have never known. </span>
<span sid='28242' title='28242'>It is a more probable supposition than murder.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28243' title='28243'>'But the eye-glasses?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28244' title='28244'>'Ah! </span>
<span sid='28245' title='28245'>I am only a student - a man of dreams. </span>
<span sid='28246' title='28246'>I cannot explain the practical things of life. </span>
<span sid='28247' title='28247'>But still, we are aware, my friend, that love-gages may take strange shapes. </span>
<span sid='28248' title='28248'>By all means take another cigarette. </span>
<span sid='28249' title='28249'>It is a pleasure to see anyone appreciate them so. </span>
<span sid='28250' title='28250'>A fan, a glove, glasses - who knows what article may be carried as a token or treasured when a man puts an end to his life? </span>
<span sid='28251' title='28251'>This gentleman speaks of footsteps in the grass, but, after all, it is easy to be mistaken on such a point. </span>
<span sid='28252' title='28252'>As to the knife, it might well be thrown far from the unfortunate man as he fell. </span>
<span sid='28253' title='28253'>It is possible that I speak as a child, but to me it seems that Willoughby Smith has met his fate by his own hand.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28254' title='28254'>Holmes seemed struck by the theory thus put forward, and he continued to walk up and down for some time, lost in thought and consuming cigarette after cigarette.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28255' title='28255'>'Tell me, Professor Coram,' he said at last, 'what is in that cupboard in the bureau?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28256' title='28256'>'Nothing that would help a thief Family papers, letters from my poor wife, diplomas of Universities which have done me honour. </span>
<span sid='28257' title='28257'>Here is the key. </span>
<span sid='28258' title='28258'>You can look for yourself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28259' title='28259'>Holmes picked up the key and looked at it for an instant; then he handed it back.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28260' title='28260'>'No; I hardly think that it would help me,' said he. </span>
<span sid='28261' title='28261'>'I should prefer to go quietly down to your garden and turn the whole matter over in my head. </span>
<span sid='28262' title='28262'>There is something to be said for the theory of suicide which you have put forward. </span>
<span sid='28263' title='28263'>We must apologize for having intruded upon you, Professor Coram, and I promise that we won't disturb you until after lunch. </span>
<span sid='28264' title='28264'>At two o'clock we will come again and report to you anything which may have happened in the interval.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28265' title='28265'>Holmes was curiously distrait, and we walked up and down the garden path for some time in silence.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28266' title='28266'>'Have you a clue?' I asked, at last.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28267' title='28267'>'It depends upon those cigarettes that I smoked,' said he. </span>
<span sid='28268' title='28268'>'It is possible that I am utterly mistaken. </span>
<span sid='28269' title='28269'>The cigarettes will show me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28270' title='28270'>'My dear Holmes,' I exclaimed, 'how on earth - '</span>
<p>
<span sid='28271' title='28271'>'Well, well, you may sec for yourself. </span>
<span sid='28272' title='28272'>If not, there's no harm done. </span>
<span sid='28273' title='28273'>Of course, we always have the optician clue to fall back upon, but I take a short cut when I can get it. </span>
<span sid='28274' title='28274'>Ah, here is the good Mrs Marker! </span>
<span sid='28275' title='28275'>Let us enjoy five minutes of instructive conversation with her.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28276' title='28276'>I may have remarked before that Holmes had, when he liked, a peculiarly ingratiating way with women, and that he very readily established terms of confidence with them. </span>
<span sid='28277' title='28277'>In half the time which he had named he had captured the housekeeper's goodwill, and was chatting with her as if he had known her for years.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28278' title='28278'>'Yes, Mr Holmes, it is as you say, sir. </span>
<span sid='28279' title='28279'>He does smoke something terrible. </span>
<span sid='28280' title='28280'>All day and sometimes all night, sir. </span>
<span sid='28281' title='28281'>I've seen that room of a morning - well, sir, you'd have thought it was a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> fog. </span>
<span sid='28282' title='28282'>Poor young Mr Smith, he was a smoker also, but not as bad as the Professor. </span>
<span sid='28283' title='28283'>His health - well, I don't know that it's better nor worse for the smoking.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28284' title='28284'>'Ah,' said Holmes, 'but it kills the appetite.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28285' title='28285'>'Well, I don't know about that, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28286' title='28286'>'I suppose the professor eats hardly anything?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28287' title='28287'>'Well, he is variable. </span>
<span sid='28288' title='28288'>I'll say that for him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28289' title='28289'>'I'll wager he took no breakfast this morning, and won't face his lunch after all the cigarettes I saw him consume.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28290' title='28290'>'Well, you're out there, sir, as it happens, for he ate a remarkable big breakfast this morning. </span>
<span sid='28291' title='28291'>I don't know when I've known him make a better one, and he's ordered a good dish of cutlets for his lunch. </span>
<span sid='28292' title='28292'>I'm surprised myself, for since I came into that room yesterday and saw young Mr Smith lying there on the floor I couldn't bear to look at food. </span>
<span sid='28293' title='28293'>Well, it takes all sorts to make a world, and the Professor hasn't let it take his appetite away.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28294' title='28294'>We loitered the morning away in the garden. </span>
<span sid='28295' title='28295'>Stanley Hopkins had gone down to the village to look into some rumours of a strange woman who had been seen by some children on the Chatham road the previous morning. </span>
<span sid='28296' title='28296'>As to my friend, all his usual energy seemed to have deserted him. </span>
<span sid='28297' title='28297'>I had never known him handle a case in such a half-hearted fashion. </span>
<span sid='28298' title='28298'>Even the news brought back by Hopkins that he had found the children and that they had undoubtedly seen a woman exactly corresponding with Holmes's description, and wearing either spectacles or eye-glasses, failed to rouse any sign of keen interest. </span>
<span sid='28299' title='28299'>He was more attentive when Susan, who waited upon us at lunch, volunteered the information that she believed Mr Smith had been out for a walk yesterday morning, and that he had only returned half an hour before the tragedy occurred. </span>
<span sid='28300' title='28300'>I could not myself see the bearing of this incident, but I clearly perceived that Holmes was weaving it into the general scheme which he had formed in his brain. </span>
<span sid='28301' title='28301'>Suddenly he sprang from his chair, and glanced at his watch. </span>
<span sid='28302' title='28302'>'Two o'clock, gentlemen,' said he. </span>
<span sid='28303' title='28303'>'We must go up and have it out with our friend the Professor.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28304' title='28304'>The old man had just finished his lunch, and certainly his empty dish bore evidence to the good appetite with which his housekeeper had credited him. </span>
<span sid='28305' title='28305'>He was, indeed, a weird figure as he turned his white mane and his glowing eyes towards us. </span>
<span sid='28306' title='28306'>The eternal cigarette smouldered in his mouth. </span>
<span sid='28307' title='28307'>He had been dressed and was seated in an arm-chair by the fire.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28308' title='28308'>'Well, Mr Holmes, have you solved this mystery yet?' </span>
<span sid='28309' title='28309'>He shoved the large tin of cigarettes which stood on a table beside him towards my companion. </span>
<span sid='28310' title='28310'>Holmes stretched out his hand at the same moment, and between them they tipped the box over the edge. </span>
<span sid='28311' title='28311'>For a minute or two we were all on our knees retrieving stray cigarettes from impossible places. </span>
<span sid='28312' title='28312'>When we rose again I observed that Holmes's eyes were shining and his cheeks tinged with colour. </span>
<span sid='28313' title='28313'>Only at a crisis have I seen those battle-signals flying.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28314' title='28314'>'Yes,' said he, 'I have solved it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28315' title='28315'>Stanley Hopkins and I stared in amazement. </span>
<span sid='28316' title='28316'>Something like a sneer quivered over the gaunt features of the old Professor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28317' title='28317'>'Indeed! </span>
<span sid='28318' title='28318'>In the garden?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28319' title='28319'>'No, here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28320' title='28320'>'Here! </span>
<span sid='28321' title='28321'>When?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28322' title='28322'>'This instant.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28323' title='28323'>'You are surely joking, Mr Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='28324' title='28324'>You compel me to tell you that this is too serious a matter to be treated in such a fashion.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28325' title='28325'>'I have forged and tested every link of my chain, Professor Coram, and I am sure that it is sound. </span>
<span sid='28326' title='28326'>What your motives are, or what exact part you play in this strange business, I am not yet able to say. </span>
<span sid='28327' title='28327'>In a few minutes I shall probably hear it from your own lips. </span>
<span sid='28328' title='28328'>Meanwhile, I will reconstruct what is past for your benefit, so that you may know the information which I still require.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28329' title='28329'>'A lady yesterday entered your study. </span>
<span sid='28330' title='28330'>She came with the intention of possessing herself of certain documents which were in your bureau. </span>
<span sid='28331' title='28331'>She had a key of her own. </span>
<span sid='28332' title='28332'>I have had an opportunity of examining yours, and I do not find that slight discoloration which the scratch made upon the varnish would have produced. </span>
<span sid='28333' title='28333'>You were not an accessory, therefore, and she came, so far as I can read the evidence, without your knowledge to rob you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28334' title='28334'>The Professor blew a cloud from his lips.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28335' title='28335'>'This is most interesting and instructive,' said he. </span>
<span sid='28336' title='28336'>'Have you no more to add? </span>
<span sid='28337' title='28337'>Surely, having traced this lady so far, you can also say what has become of her.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28338' title='28338'>'I will endeavour to do so. </span>
<span sid='28339' title='28339'>In the first place, she was seized by your secretary, and stabbed him in order to escape. </span>
<span sid='28340' title='28340'>This catastrophe I am inclined to regard as an unhappy accident, for I am convinced that the lady had no intention of inflicting so grievous an injury. </span>
<span sid='28341' title='28341'>An assassin does not come unarmed. </span>
<span sid='28342' title='28342'>Horrified by what she had done, she rushed wildly away from the scene of the tragedy. </span>
<span sid='28343' title='28343'>Unfortunately for her she had lost her glasses in the scuffle, and as she was extremely short-sighted she was really helpless without them. </span>
<span sid='28344' title='28344'>She ran down a corridor, which she imagined to be that by which she had come - both were lined with coconut matting - and it was only when it was too late that she understood that she had taken the wrong passage and that her retreat was cut off behind her. </span>
<span sid='28345' title='28345'>What was she to do? </span>
<span sid='28346' title='28346'>She could not go back. </span>
<span sid='28347' title='28347'>She could not remain where she was. </span>
<span sid='28348' title='28348'>She must go on. </span>
<span sid='28349' title='28349'>She went on. </span>
<span sid='28350' title='28350'>She mounted a stair, pushed open a door, and found herself in your room.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28351' title='28351'>The old man sat with his mouth open staring wildly at Holmes. </span>
<span sid='28352' title='28352'>Amazement and fear were stamped upon his expressive features. </span>
<span sid='28353' title='28353'>Now, with an effort, he shrugged his shoulders and burst into insincere laughter.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28354' title='28354'>'All very fine, Mr Holmes,' said he. </span>
<span sid='28355' title='28355'>'But there is one little flaw in a splendid theory. </span>
<span sid='28356' title='28356'>I was myself in my room, and I never left it during the day.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28357' title='28357'>'I am aware of that, Professor Coram.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28358' title='28358'>'And you mean to say that I could lie upon that bed and not be aware that a woman had entered my room?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28359' title='28359'>'I never said so. </span>
<span sid='28360' title='28360'>You were aware of it. </span>
<span sid='28361' title='28361'>You spoke with her. </span>
<span sid='28362' title='28362'>You recognized her. </span>
<span sid='28363' title='28363'>You aided her to escape.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28364' title='28364'>Again the professor burst into high-keyed laughter. </span>
<span sid='28365' title='28365'>He had risen to his feet, and his eyes glowed like embers.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28366' title='28366'>'You are mad!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='28367' title='28367'>'You are talking insanely. </span>
<span sid='28368' title='28368'>I helped her to escape? </span>
<span sid='28369' title='28369'>Where is she now?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28370' title='28370'>'She is there,' said Holmes, and he pointed to a high bookcase in the corner of the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28371' title='28371'>I saw the old man throw up his arms, a terrible convulsion passed over his grim face, and he fell back in his chair. </span>
<span sid='28372' title='28372'>At the same instant the bookcase at which Holmes pointed swung round upon a hinge, and a woman rushed out into the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28373' title='28373'>'You are right,' she cried, in a strange foreign voice. </span>
<span sid='28374' title='28374'>'You are right! </span>
<span sid='28375' title='28375'>I am here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28376' title='28376'>She was brown with the dust and draped with the cobwebs which had come from the walls of her hiding-place. </span>
<span sid='28377' title='28377'>Her face, too, was streaked with grime, and at the best she could never have been handsome, for she had the exact physical characteristics which Holmes had divined, with, in addition, a long and obstinate chin. </span>
<span sid='28378' title='28378'>What with her natural blindness, and what with the change from dark to light, she stood as one dazed, blinking about her to see where and who we were. </span>
<span sid='28379' title='28379'>And yet, in spite of all these disadvantages, there was a certain nobility in the woman's bearing, a gallantry in the defiant chin and in the upraised head, which compelled something of respect and admiration. </span>
<span sid='28380' title='28380'>Stanley Hopkins had laid his hand upon her arm and claimed her as his prisoner, but she waved him aside gently, and yet with an overmastering dignity which compelled obedience. </span>
<span sid='28381' title='28381'>The old man lay back in his chair, with a twitching face, and stared at her with brooding eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28382' title='28382'>'Yes, sir, I am your prisoner,' she said. </span>
<span sid='28383' title='28383'>'From where I stood I could hear everything, and I know that you have learned the truth. </span>
<span sid='28384' title='28384'>I confess it all. </span>
<span sid='28385' title='28385'>It was I who killed the young man. </span>
<span sid='28386' title='28386'>But you are right, you who say that it was an accident. </span>
<span sid='28387' title='28387'>I did not even know that it was a knife which I held in my hand, for in my despair I snatched anything from the table and struck at him to make him let me go. </span>
<span sid='28388' title='28388'>It is the truth that I tell.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28389' title='28389'>'Madame,' said Holmes, 'I am sure that it is the truth. </span>
<span sid='28390' title='28390'>I fear that you are far from well.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28391' title='28391'>She had turned a dreadful colour, the more ghastly under the dark dust-streaks upon her face. </span>
<span sid='28392' title='28392'>She seated herself on the side of the bed; then she resumed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28393' title='28393'>'I have only a little time here,' she said, 'but I would have you to know the whole truth. </span>
<span sid='28394' title='28394'>I am this man's wife. </span>
<span sid='28395' title='28395'>He is not an Englishman. </span>
<span sid='28396' title='28396'>He is a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Russia&t=h'>Russia</a>n. </span>
<span sid='28397' title='28397'>His name I will not tell.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28398' title='28398'>For the first time the old man stirred. </span>
<span sid='28399' title='28399'>'God bless you, Anna!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='28400' title='28400'>'God bless you!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28401' title='28401'>She cast a look of the deepest disdain in his direction. </span>
<span sid='28402' title='28402'>'Why should you cling so hard to that wretched life of yours, Sergius?' said she. </span>
<span sid='28403' title='28403'>'It has done harm to many and good to none - not even to yourself. </span>
<span sid='28404' title='28404'>However, it is not for me to cause the frail thread to be snapped before God's time. </span>
<span sid='28405' title='28405'>I have enough already upon my soul since I crossed the threshold of this cursed house. </span>
<span sid='28406' title='28406'>But I must speak, or I shall be too late.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28407' title='28407'>'I have said, gentlemen, that I am this man's wife. </span>
<span sid='28408' title='28408'>He was fifty and I a foolish girl of twenty when we married. </span>
<span sid='28409' title='28409'>It was in a city of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Russia&t=h'>Russia</a>, a University - I will not name the place.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28410' title='28410'>'God bless you, Anna!' murmured the old man again.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28411' title='28411'>'We were reformers - revolutionists - Nihilists, you understand. </span>
<span sid='28412' title='28412'>He and I and many more. </span>
<span sid='28413' title='28413'>Then there came a time of trouble, a police officer was killed, many were arrested, evidence was wanted, and in order to save his own life and to earn a great reward my husband betrayed his own wife and his companions. </span>
<span sid='28414' title='28414'>Yes; we were all arrested upon his confession. </span>
<span sid='28415' title='28415'>Some of us found our way to the gallows and some to Siberia. </span>
<span sid='28416' title='28416'>I was among these last, but my term was not for life. </span>
<span sid='28417' title='28417'>My husband came to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> with his ill-gotten gains, and has lived in quiet ever since, knowing well that if the Brotherhood knew where he was not a week would pass before justice would be done.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28418' title='28418'>The old man reached out a trembling hand and helped himself to a cigarette. </span>
<span sid='28419' title='28419'>'I am in your hands, Anna,' said he. </span>
<span sid='28420' title='28420'>'You were always good to me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28421' title='28421'>'I have not yet told you the height of his villainy!' said she. </span>
<span sid='28422' title='28422'>'Among our comrades of the Order there was one who was the friend of my heart. </span>
<span sid='28423' title='28423'>He was noble, unselfish, loving - all that my husband was not. </span>
<span sid='28424' title='28424'>He hated violence. </span>
<span sid='28425' title='28425'>We were all guilty - if that is guilt - but he was not. </span>
<span sid='28426' title='28426'>He wrote for ever dissuading me from such a course. </span>
<span sid='28427' title='28427'>These letters would have saved him. </span>
<span sid='28428' title='28428'>So would my diary, in which from day to day I had entered both my feelings towards him and the view which each of us had taken. </span>
<span sid='28429' title='28429'>My husband found and kept both diary and letters. </span>
<span sid='28430' title='28430'>He hid them, and he tried hard to swear away the young man's life. </span>
<span sid='28431' title='28431'>In this he failed, but Alexis was sent a convict to Siberia, where now, at this moment, he works in a salt mine. </span>
<span sid='28432' title='28432'>Think of that, you villain, you villain; now, now, at this very moment, Alexis, a man whose name you are not worthy to speak, works and lives like a slave, and yet I have your life in my hands and I let you go!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28433' title='28433'>'You were always a noble woman, Anna,' said the old man, puffing at his cigarette.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28434' title='28434'>She had risen, but she fell back again with a little cry of pain.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28435' title='28435'>'I must finish,' she said. </span>
<span sid='28436' title='28436'>'When my term was over I set myself to get the diary and letters, which if sent to the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Russia&t=h'>Russia</a>n Government, would procure my friend's release. </span>
<span sid='28437' title='28437'>I knew that my husband had come to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>. </span>
<span sid='28438' title='28438'>After months of searching I discovered where he was. </span>
<span sid='28439' title='28439'>I knew that he still had the diary, for when I was in Siberia I had a letter from him once reproaching me and quoting some passages from its pages. </span>
<span sid='28440' title='28440'>Yet I was sure that with his revengeful nature he would never give it to me of his own free will. </span>
<span sid='28441' title='28441'>I must get it for myself. </span>
<span sid='28442' title='28442'>With this object I engaged an agent from a private detective firm, who entered my husband's house as secretary - it was your second secretary, Sergius, the one who left you so hurriedly. </span>
<span sid='28443' title='28443'>He found that papers were kept in the cupboard, and he got an impression of the key. </span>
<span sid='28444' title='28444'>He would not go farther. </span>
<span sid='28445' title='28445'>He furnished me with a plan of the house, and he told me that in the forenoon the study was always empty, as the secretary was employed up here. </span>
<span sid='28446' title='28446'>So at last I took my courage in both hands and I came down to get the papers for myself. </span>
<span sid='28447' title='28447'>I succeeded, but at what a cost!</span>
<p>
<span sid='28448' title='28448'>'I had just taken the papers and was locking the cupboard when the young man seized me. </span>
<span sid='28449' title='28449'>I had seen him already that morning. </span>
<span sid='28450' title='28450'>He had met me in the road, and I had asked him to tell me where Professor Coram lived, not knowing that he was in his employ.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28451' title='28451'>'Exactly! exactly!' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='28452' title='28452'>'The secretary came back and told his employer of the woman he had met. </span>
<span sid='28453' title='28453'>Then in his last breath he tried to send a message that it was she - the she whom he had just discussed with him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28454' title='28454'>'You must let me speak,' said the woman, in an imperative voice, and her face contracted as if in pain. </span>
<span sid='28455' title='28455'>'When he had fallen I rushed from the room, chose the wrong door, and found myself in my husband's room. </span>
<span sid='28456' title='28456'>He spoke of giving me up. </span>
<span sid='28457' title='28457'>I showed him that if he did so his life was in my hands. </span>
<span sid='28458' title='28458'>If he gave me to the law I could give him to the Brotherhood. </span>
<span sid='28459' title='28459'>It was not that I wished to live for my own sake, but it was that I desired to accomplish my purpose. </span>
<span sid='28460' title='28460'>He knew that I would do what I said - that his own fate was involved in mine. </span>
<span sid='28461' title='28461'>For that reason, and for no other, he shielded me. </span>
<span sid='28462' title='28462'>He thrust me into that dark hiding-place, a relic of old days, known only to himself. </span>
<span sid='28463' title='28463'>He took his meals in his own room, and so was able to give me part of his food. </span>
<span sid='28464' title='28464'>It was agreed that when the police left the house I should slip away by night and come back no more. </span>
<span sid='28465' title='28465'>But in some way you have read our plans.' </span>
<span sid='28466' title='28466'>She tore from the bosom of her dress a small packet. </span>
<span sid='28467' title='28467'>'These are my last words,' said she; 'here is the packet which will save Alexis. </span>
<span sid='28468' title='28468'>I confide it to your honour and to your love of justice. </span>
<span sid='28469' title='28469'>Take it! </span>
<span sid='28470' title='28470'>You will deliver it at the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Russia&t=h'>Russia</a>n Embassy. </span>
<span sid='28471' title='28471'>Now I have done my duty, and-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28472' title='28472'>'Stop her!' cried Holmes. </span>
<span sid='28473' title='28473'>He had bounded across the room and had wrenched a small phial from her hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28474' title='28474'>'Too late!' she said, sinking back on the bed. </span>
<span sid='28475' title='28475'>'Too late! </span>
<span sid='28476' title='28476'>I took the poison before I left my hiding-place. </span>
<span sid='28477' title='28477'>My head swims! </span>
<span sid='28478' title='28478'>I am going! </span>
<span sid='28479' title='28479'>I charge you, sir, to remember the packet.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28480' title='28480'>'A simple case, and yet in some ways an instructive one,' Holmes remarked as we travelled back to town. </span>
<span sid='28481' title='28481'>'It hinged from the outset upon the pince-nez. </span>
<span sid='28482' title='28482'>But for the fortunate chance of the dying man having seized these I am not sure that we could ever have reached our solution. </span>
<span sid='28483' title='28483'>It was clear to me from the strength of the glasses that the wearer must have been very blind and helpless when deprived of them. </span>
<span sid='28484' title='28484'>When you asked me to believe that she walked along a narrow strip of grass without once making a false step I remarked, as you may remember, that it was a noteworthy performance. </span>
<span sid='28485' title='28485'>In my mind, I set it down as an impossible performance, save in the unlikely case that she had a second pair of glasses I was forced, therefore, to seriously consider the hypothesis that she had remained within the house. </span>
<span sid='28486' title='28486'>On perceiving the similarity of the two corridors, it became clear that she might very easily have made such a mistake, and in that case it was evident that she must have entered the Professor's room. </span>
<span sid='28487' title='28487'>I was keenly on the alert, therefore, for whatever would bear out this supposition, and I examined the room narrowly for anything in the shape of a hiding- place. </span>
<span sid='28488' title='28488'>The carpet seemed continuous and firmly nailed, so I dismissed the idea of a trap-door. </span>
<span sid='28489' title='28489'>There might well be a recess behind the books. </span>
<span sid='28490' title='28490'>As you are aware, such devices are common in old libraries. </span>
<span sid='28491' title='28491'>I observed that books were piled on the floor at all other points, but that one bookcase was left clear. </span>
<span sid='28492' title='28492'>This, then, might be the door. </span>
<span sid='28493' title='28493'>I could see no marks to guide me, but the carpet was of a dun colour, which lends itself very well to examination. </span>
<span sid='28494' title='28494'>I therefore smoked a great number of those excellent cigarettes, and I dropped the ash all over the space in front of the suspected bookcase. </span>
<span sid='28495' title='28495'>It was a simple trick, but exceedingly effective. </span>
<span sid='28496' title='28496'>I then went downstairs, and I ascertained in your presence, Watson, without your quite perceiving the drift of my remarks, that Professor Coram's consumption of food had increased - as one would expect when he is supplying a second person. </span>
<span sid='28497' title='28497'>We then ascended to the room again, when, by upsetting the cigarette-box, I obtained a very excellent view of the floor, and was able to see quite clearly, from the traces upon the cigarette ash, that the prisoner had, in our absence, come out from her retreat. </span>
<span sid='28498' title='28498'>Well, Hopkins, here we are at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Charing Cross&t=h'>Charing Cross</a>, and I congratulate you on having brought your case to a successful conclusion. </span>
<span sid='28499' title='28499'>You are going to headquarters, no doubt. </span>
<span sid='28500' title='28500'>I think, Watson, you and I will drive together to the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Russia&t=h'>Russia</a>n Embassy.'</span>
