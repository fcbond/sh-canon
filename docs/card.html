<h1><span sid='53877' title='53877'>The Adventure of the Cardboard Box</span></h1>
<p class="subtitle">Arthur Conan Doyle<label for="sn-meta-card" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-meta-card" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><!--googleoff: all--><b>Story Number</b>: 16<br><b>Published in</b>: The Strand Magazine in January 1893<br><b>Collected in</b>: His Last Bow: Some Reminiscences of Sherlock Holmes<!--googleon: all--></span></p>
<p>
<span sid='53878' title='53878'>In choosing a few typical cases which illustrate the remarkable mental qualities of my friend, Sherlock Holmes, I have endeavoured, as far as possible, to select those which presented the minimum of sensationalism, while offering a fair field for his talents. </span>
<span sid='53879' title='53879'>It is, however, unfortunately, impossible to entirely separate the sensational from the criminal, and a chronicler is left in the dilemma that he must either sacrifice details which are essential to his statement, and so give a false impression of the problem, or he must use matter which chance, and not choice, has provided him with. </span>
<span sid='53880' title='53880'>With this short preface I shall turn to my notes of what proved to be a strange, though a peculiarly terrible, chain of events.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53881' title='53881'>It was a blazing hot day in August. </span>
<span sid='53882' title='53882'><a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> was like an oven, and the glare of the sunlight upon the yellow brickwork of the houses across the road was painful to the eye. </span>
<span sid='53883' title='53883'>It was hard to believe that these were the same walls which loomed so gloomily through the fogs of winter. </span>
<span sid='53884' title='53884'>Our blinds were half-drawn, and Holmes lay curled upon the sofa, reading and re-reading a letter which he had received by the morning post. </span>
<span sid='53885' title='53885'>For myself, my term of service in India had trained me to stand heat better than cold, and a thermometer at go was no hardship. </span>
<span sid='53886' title='53886'>But the morning paper was uninteresting. </span>
<span sid='53887' title='53887'><a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Parliament&t=h'>Parliament</a> had risen. </span>
<span sid='53888' title='53888'>Everybody was out of town, and I yearned for the glades of the New Forest or the shingle of Southsea. </span>
<span sid='53889' title='53889'>A depleted bank account had caused me to postpone my holiday, and as to my companion, neither the country nor the sea presented the slightest attraction to him. </span>
<span sid='53890' title='53890'>He loved to lie in the very centre of five millions of people, with his filaments stretching out and running through them, responsive to every little rumour or suspicion of unsolved crime. </span>
<span sid='53891' title='53891'>Appreciation of Nature found no place among his many gifts, and his only change was when he turned his mind from the evil-doer of the town to track down his brother of the country.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53892' title='53892'>Finding that Holmes was too absorbed for conversation I had tossed aside the barren paper and, leaning back in my chair, I fell into a brown study. </span>
<span sid='53893' title='53893'>Suddenly my companion's voice broke in upon my thoughts.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53894' title='53894'>'You are right, Watson,' said he. </span>
<span sid='53895' title='53895'>'It does seem a most preposterous way of settling a dispute.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53896' title='53896'>'Most preposterous!' I exclaimed, and then suddenly realizing how he had echoed the inmost thought of my soul, I sat up in my chair and stared at him in blank amazement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53897' title='53897'>'What is this, Holmes?' I cried. </span>
<span sid='53898' title='53898'>'This is beyond anything which I could have imagined.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53899' title='53899'>He laughed heartily at my perplexity.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53900' title='53900'>'You remember,' said he, 'that some little time ago when I read you the passage in one of Poe's sketches in which a close reasoner follows the unspoken thoughts of his companion, you were inclined to treat the matter as a mere tour-de-force of the author. </span>
<span sid='53901' title='53901'>On my remarking that I was constantly in the habit of doing the same thing you expressed incredulity.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53902' title='53902'>'Oh, no!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53903' title='53903'>'Perhaps not with your tongue, my dear Watson, but certainly with your eyebrows. </span>
<span sid='53904' title='53904'>So when I saw you throw down your paper and enter upon a train of thought, I was very happy to have the opportunity of reading it off, and eventually of breaking into it, as a proof that I had been in rapport with you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53905' title='53905'>But I was still far from satisfied. </span>
<span sid='53906' title='53906'>'In the example which you read to me,' said I, 'the reasoner drew his conclusions from the actions of the man whom he observed. </span>
<span sid='53907' title='53907'>If I remember right, he stumbled over a heap of stones, looked up at the stars, and so on. </span>
<span sid='53908' title='53908'>But I have been seated quietly in my chair, and what clues can I have given you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53909' title='53909'>'You do yourself an injustice. </span>
<span sid='53910' title='53910'>The features are given to man as the means by which he shall express his emotions, and yours are faithful servants.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53911' title='53911'>'Do you mean to say that you read my train of thoughts from my features?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53912' title='53912'>'Your features, and especially your eyes. </span>
<span sid='53913' title='53913'>Perhaps you cannot yourself recall how your reverie commenced?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53914' title='53914'>'No, I cannot.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53915' title='53915'>'Then I will tell you. </span>
<span sid='53916' title='53916'>After throwing down your paper, which was the action which drew my attention to you, you sat for half a minute with a vacant expression. </span>
<span sid='53917' title='53917'>Then your eyes fixed themselves upon your newly-framed picture of General Gordon, and I saw by the alteration in your face that a train of thought had been started. </span>
<span sid='53918' title='53918'>But it did not lead very far. </span>
<span sid='53919' title='53919'>Your eyes flashed across to the unframed portrait of Henry Ward Beecher which stands upon the top of your books. </span>
<span sid='53920' title='53920'>You then glanced up at the wall, and of course your meaning was obvious. </span>
<span sid='53921' title='53921'>You were thinking that if the portrait were framed, it would just cover that bare space and correspond with Gordon's picture over there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53922' title='53922'>'You have followed me wonderfully!' I exclaimed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53923' title='53923'>'So far I could hardly have gone astray. </span>
<span sid='53924' title='53924'>But now your thoughts went back to Beecher, and you looked hard across as if you were studying the character in his features. </span>
<span sid='53925' title='53925'>Then your eyes ceased to pucker, but you continued to look across, and your face was thoughtful. </span>
<span sid='53926' title='53926'>You were recalling the incidents of Beecher's career. </span>
<span sid='53927' title='53927'>I was well aware that you could not do this without thinking of the mission which he undertook on behalf of the North at the time of the Civil War, for I remember your expressing your passionate indignation at the way in which he was received by the more turbulent of our people. </span>
<span sid='53928' title='53928'>You felt so strongly about it, that I knew you could not think of Beecher without thinking of that also. </span>
<span sid='53929' title='53929'>When a moment later I saw your eyes wander away from the picture, I suspected that your mind had now turned to the Civil War, and when I observed that your lips set, your eyes sparkled, and your hands clenched, I was positive that you were indeed thinking of the gallantry which was shown by both sides in that desperate struggle. </span>
<span sid='53930' title='53930'>But then, again, your face grew sadder; your shook your head. </span>
<span sid='53931' title='53931'>You were dwelling upon the sadness and horror and useless waste of life. </span>
<span sid='53932' title='53932'>Your hand stole towards your own old wound and a smile quivered on your lips, which showed me that the ridiculous side of this method of settling international questions had forced itself upon your mind. </span>
<span sid='53933' title='53933'>At this point I agreed with you that it was preposterous, and was glad to find that all my deductions had been correct.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53934' title='53934'>'Absolutely!' said I. </span>
<span sid='53935' title='53935'>'And now that you have explained it, I confess that I am as amazed as before.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53936' title='53936'>'It was very superficial, my dear Watson, I assure you. </span>
<span sid='53937' title='53937'>I should not have intruded it upon your attention had you not shown some incredulity the other day. </span>
<span sid='53938' title='53938'>But I have in my hands here a little problem which may prove to be more difficult of solution than my small essay in thought reading. </span>
<span sid='53939' title='53939'>Have you observed in the paper a short paragraph referring to the remarkable contents of a packet sent through the post to Miss Susan Cushing, of Cross Street, Croydon?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53940' title='53940'>'No, I saw nothing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53941' title='53941'>'Ah! then you must have overlooked it. </span>
<span sid='53942' title='53942'>Just toss it over to me. </span>
<span sid='53943' title='53943'>Here it is, under the financial column. </span>
<span sid='53944' title='53944'>Perhaps you would be good enough to read it aloud.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53945' title='53945'>I picked up the paper which he had thrown back to me, and read the paragraph indicated. </span>
<span sid='53946' title='53946'>It was headed, 'A Gruesome Packet.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53947' title='53947'>'Miss Susan Cushing, living at Cross Street, Croydon, has been made the victim of what must be regarded as a peculiarly revolting practical joke, unless some more sinister meaning should prove to be attached to the incident. </span>
<span sid='53948' title='53948'>At two o'clock yesterday afternoon a small packet, wrapped in brown paper, was handed in by the postman. </span>
<span sid='53949' title='53949'>A cardboard box was inside, which was filled with coarse salt. </span>
<span sid='53950' title='53950'>On emptying this, Miss Cushing was horrified to find two human ears, apparently quite freshly severed. </span>
<span sid='53951' title='53951'>The box had been sent by parcel post from Belfast upon the morning before. </span>
<span sid='53952' title='53952'>There is no indication as to the sender, and the matter is the more mysterious as Miss Cushing, who is a maiden lady of fifty, has led a most retired life, and has so few acquaintances or correspondents that it is a rare event for her to receive anything through the post. </span>
<span sid='53953' title='53953'>Some years ago, however, when she resided at Penge, she let apartments in her house to three young medical students, whom she was obliged to get rid of on account of their noisy and irregular habits. </span>
<span sid='53954' title='53954'>The police are of opinion that this outrage may have been perpetrated upon Miss Cushing by these youths, who owed her a grudge, and who hoped to frighten her by sending her these relics of the dissecting-rooms. </span>
<span sid='53955' title='53955'>Some probability is lent to the theory by the fact that one of these students came from the north of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ireland&t=h'>Ireland</a>, and, to the best of Miss Cushing's belief, from Belfast. </span>
<span sid='53956' title='53956'>In the meantime, the matter is being actively investigated, Mr Lestrade, one of the very smartest of our detective officers, being in charge of the case.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53957' title='53957'>'So much for the Daily Chronicle,' said Holmes, as I finished reading. </span>
<span sid='53958' title='53958'>'Now for our friend Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='53959' title='53959'>I had a note from him this morning, in which he says: </span>
<span sid='53960' title='53960'>"I think that this case is very much in your line. </span>
<span sid='53961' title='53961'>We have every hope of clearing the matter up, but we find a little difficulty in getting anything to work upon. </span>
<span sid='53962' title='53962'>We have, of course, wired to the Belfast postoffice, but a large number of parcels were handed in upon that day, and they have no means of identifying this particular one, or of remembering the sender. </span>
<span sid='53963' title='53963'>The box is a half-pound box of honeydew tobacco, and does not help us in any way. </span>
<span sid='53964' title='53964'>The medical student theory still appears to me to be the most feasible, but if you should have a few hours to spare, I should be very happy to see you out here. </span>
<span sid='53965' title='53965'>I shall be either at the house or in the police-station all day." </span>
<span sid='53966' title='53966'>What say you, Watson? </span>
<span sid='53967' title='53967'>Can you rise superior to the heat, and run down to Croydon with me on the off chance of a case for your annals?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53968' title='53968'>'I was longing for something to do.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53969' title='53969'>'You shall have it, then. </span>
<span sid='53970' title='53970'>Ring for our boots, and tell them to order a cab. </span>
<span sid='53971' title='53971'>I'll be back in a moment, when I have changed my dressing-gown and filled my cigar-case.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53972' title='53972'>A shower of rain fell while we were in the train, and the heat was far less oppressive in Croydon than in town. </span>
<span sid='53973' title='53973'>Holmes had sent on a wire, so that Lestrade, as wiry, as dapper, and as ferret-like as ever, was waiting for us at the station. </span>
<span sid='53974' title='53974'>A walk of five minutes took us to Cross Street, where Miss Cushing resided.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53975' title='53975'>It was a very long street of two-story brick houses, neat and prim, with whitened stone steps and little groups of aproned women gossiping at the doors. </span>
<span sid='53976' title='53976'>Half-way down, Lestrade stopped and tapped at a door, which was opened by a small servant girl. </span>
<span sid='53977' title='53977'>Miss Cushing was sitting in the front room, into which we were ushered. </span>
<span sid='53978' title='53978'>She was a placid-faced woman with large, gentle eyes, and grizzled hair curving down over her temples on each side. </span>
<span sid='53979' title='53979'>A worked antimacassar lay upon her lap and a basket of coloured silks stood upon a stool beside her.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53980' title='53980'>'They are in the outhouse, those dreadful things,' said she, as Lestrade entered. </span>
<span sid='53981' title='53981'>'I wish that you would take them away altogether.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53982' title='53982'>'So I shall, Miss Cushing. </span>
<span sid='53983' title='53983'>I only kept them here until my friend, Mr Holmes, should have seen them in your presence.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53984' title='53984'>'Why in my presence, sir?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53985' title='53985'>'In case he wished to ask any questions.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53986' title='53986'>'What is the use of asking me questions, when I tell you that I know nothing whatever about it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53987' title='53987'>'Quite so, madam,' said Holmes, in his soothing way. </span>
<span sid='53988' title='53988'>'I have no doubt that you have been annoyed more than enough already over this business.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53989' title='53989'>'Indeed, I have, sir. </span>
<span sid='53990' title='53990'>I am a quiet woman and live a retired life. </span>
<span sid='53991' title='53991'>It is something new for me to see my name in the papers and to find the police in my house. </span>
<span sid='53992' title='53992'>I won't have those things in here, Mr Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='53993' title='53993'>If you wish to see them you must go to the outhouse.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53994' title='53994'>It was a small shed in the narrow garden which ran down behind the house. </span>
<span sid='53995' title='53995'>Lestrade went in and brought out a yellow cardboard box, with a piece of brown paper and some string. </span>
<span sid='53996' title='53996'>There was a bench at the edge of the path, and we all sat down while Holmes examined, one by one, the articles which Lestrade had handed to him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53997' title='53997'>'The string is exceedingly interesting,' he remarked, holding it up to the light and sniffing at it. </span>
<span sid='53998' title='53998'>'What do you make of this string, Lestrade?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53999' title='53999'>'It has been tarred.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54000' title='54000'>'Precisely. </span>
<span sid='54001' title='54001'>It is a piece of tarred twine. </span>
<span sid='54002' title='54002'>You have also, no doubt, remarked that Miss Cushing has cut the cord with a scissors, as can be seen by the double fray on each side. </span>
<span sid='54003' title='54003'>This is of importance.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54004' title='54004'>'I cannot see the importance,' said Lestrade.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54005' title='54005'>'The importance lies in the fact that the knot is left intact, and that this knot is of a peculiar character.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54006' title='54006'>'It is very neatly tied. </span>
<span sid='54007' title='54007'>I had already made a note to that effect,' said Lestrade, complacently.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54008' title='54008'>'So much for the string then,' said Holmes, smiling; 'now for the box wrapper. </span>
<span sid='54009' title='54009'>Brown paper, with a distinct smell of coffee. </span>
<span sid='54010' title='54010'>What, you did not observe it? </span>
<span sid='54011' title='54011'>I think there can be no doubt of it. </span>
<span sid='54012' title='54012'>Address printed in rather straggling characters: </span>
<span sid='54013' title='54013'>"Miss S. Cushing, Cross Street, Croydon." </span>
<span sid='54014' title='54014'>Done with a broad pointed pen, probably a J, and with very inferior ink. </span>
<span sid='54015' title='54015'>The word Croydon has been spelt originally with an i, which has been changed to y. </span>
<span sid='54016' title='54016'>The parcel was directed, then, by a man - the printing is distinctly masculine - of limited education and unacquainted with the town of Croydon. </span>
<span sid='54017' title='54017'>So far, so good! </span>
<span sid='54018' title='54018'>The box is a yellow, half-pound honeydew box, with nothing distinctive save two thumb marks at the left bottom corner. </span>
<span sid='54019' title='54019'>It is filled with rough salt of the quality used for preserving hides and other of the coarser commercial purposes. </span>
<span sid='54020' title='54020'>And embedded in it are these very singular inclosures.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54021' title='54021'>He took out the two ears as he spoke, and laying a board across his knees, he examined them minutely, while Lestrade and I, bending forward on each side of him, glanced alternately at these dreadful relics and at the thoughtful, eager face of our companion. </span>
<span sid='54022' title='54022'>Finally he returned them to the box once more, and sat for a while in deep thought.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54023' title='54023'>'You have observed, of course,' said he at last, 'that the ears are not a pair.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54024' title='54024'>'Yes, I have noticed that. </span>
<span sid='54025' title='54025'>But if this were the practical joke of some students from the dissecting-rooms, it would be as easy for them to send two odd ears as a pair.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54026' title='54026'>'Precisely. </span>
<span sid='54027' title='54027'>But this is not a practical joke.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54028' title='54028'>'You are sure of it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54029' title='54029'>'The presumption is strongly against it. </span>
<span sid='54030' title='54030'>Bodies in the dissecting-rooms are injected with preservative fluid. </span>
<span sid='54031' title='54031'>These ears bear no signs of this. </span>
<span sid='54032' title='54032'>They are fresh, too. </span>
<span sid='54033' title='54033'>They have been cut off with a blunt instrument, which would hardly happen if a student had done it. </span>
<span sid='54034' title='54034'>Again, carbolic or rectified spirits would be the preservatives which would suggest themselves to the medical mind, certainly not rough salt. </span>
<span sid='54035' title='54035'>I repeat that there is no practical joke here, but that we are investigating a serious crime.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54036' title='54036'>A vague thrill ran through me as I listened to my companion's words and saw the stern gravity which had hardened his features. </span>
<span sid='54037' title='54037'>This brutal preliminary seemed to shadow forth some strange and inexplicable horror in the background. </span>
<span sid='54038' title='54038'>Lestrade, however, shook his head like a man who is only half convinced.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54039' title='54039'>'There are objections to the joke theory, no doubt,' said he; 'but there are much stronger reasons against the other. </span>
<span sid='54040' title='54040'>We know that this woman has led a most quiet and respectable life at Penge and here for the last twenty years. </span>
<span sid='54041' title='54041'>She has hardly been away from her home for a day during that time. </span>
<span sid='54042' title='54042'>Why on earth, then, should any criminal send her the proofs of his guilt, especially as, unless she is a most consummate actress, she understands quite as little of the matter as we do?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54043' title='54043'>'That is the problem which we have to solve,' Holmes answered, 'and for my part I shall set about it by presuming that my reasoning is correct, and that a double murder has been committed. </span>
<span sid='54044' title='54044'>One of these ears is a woman's, small, finely formed, and pierced for an earring. </span>
<span sid='54045' title='54045'>The other is a man's, sunburned, discoloured, and also pierced for an earring. </span>
<span sid='54046' title='54046'>These two people are presumably dead, or we should have heard their story before now. </span>
<span sid='54047' title='54047'>To-day is Friday. </span>
<span sid='54048' title='54048'>The packet was posted on Thursday morning. </span>
<span sid='54049' title='54049'>The tragedy, then, occurred on Wednesday or Tuesday, or earlier. </span>
<span sid='54050' title='54050'>If the two people were murdered, who but their murderer would have sent this sign of his work to Miss Cushing? </span>
<span sid='54051' title='54051'>We may take it that the sender of the packet is the man whom we want. </span>
<span sid='54052' title='54052'>But he must have some strong reason for sending Miss Cushing this packet. </span>
<span sid='54053' title='54053'>What reason, then? </span>
<span sid='54054' title='54054'>It must have been to tell her that the deed was done; or to pain her, perhaps. </span>
<span sid='54055' title='54055'>But in that case she knows who it is. </span>
<span sid='54056' title='54056'>Does she know? </span>
<span sid='54057' title='54057'>I doubt it. </span>
<span sid='54058' title='54058'>If she knew, why should she call the police in? </span>
<span sid='54059' title='54059'>She might have buried the ears, and no one would have been the wiser. </span>
<span sid='54060' title='54060'>That is what she would have done if she had wished to shield the criminal. </span>
<span sid='54061' title='54061'>But if she does not wish to shield him she would give his name. </span>
<span sid='54062' title='54062'>There is a tangle here which needs straightening out.' </span>
<span sid='54063' title='54063'>He had been talking in a high, quick voice, staring blankly up over the garden fence, but now he sprang briskly to his feet and walked towards the house.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54064' title='54064'>'I have a few questions to ask Miss Cushing,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54065' title='54065'>'In that case I may leave you here,' said Lestrade, 'for I have another small business on hand. </span>
<span sid='54066' title='54066'>I think that I have nothing further to learn from Miss Cushing. </span>
<span sid='54067' title='54067'>You will find me at the police-station.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54068' title='54068'>'We shall look in on our way to the train,' answered Holmes. </span>
<span sid='54069' title='54069'>A moment later he and I were back in the front room, where the impassive lady was still quietly working away at her antimacassar. </span>
<span sid='54070' title='54070'>She put it down on her lap as we entered, and looked at us with her frank, searching blue eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54071' title='54071'>'I am convinced, sir,' she said, 'that this matter is a mistake, and that the parcel was never meant for me at all. </span>
<span sid='54072' title='54072'>I have said this several times to the gentleman from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>, but he simply laughs at me. </span>
<span sid='54073' title='54073'>I have not an enemy in the world, as far as I know, so why should anyone play me such a trick?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54074' title='54074'>'I am coming to be of the same opinion, Miss Cushing,' said Holmes, taking a seat beside her. </span>
<span sid='54075' title='54075'>'I think that it is more than probable-' he paused, and I was surprised on glancing round to see that he was staring with singular intentness at the lady's profile. </span>
<span sid='54076' title='54076'>Surprise and satisfaction were both for an instant to be read upon his eager face, though when she glanced round to find out the cause of his silence he had become as demure as ever. </span>
<span sid='54077' title='54077'>I stared hard myself at her flat, grizzled hair, her trim cap, her little gilt earrings, her placid features; but I could see nothing which could account for my companion's evident excitement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54078' title='54078'>'There were one or two questions-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54079' title='54079'>'Oh, I am weary of questions!' cried Miss Cushing, impatiently.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54080' title='54080'>'You have two sisters, I believe.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54081' title='54081'>'How could you know that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54082' title='54082'>'I observed the very instant that I entered the room that you have a portrait group of three ladies upon the mantelpiece, one of whom is undoubtedly yourself, while the others are so exceedingly like you that there could be no doubt of the relationship.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54083' title='54083'>'Yes, you are quite right. </span>
<span sid='54084' title='54084'>Those are my sisters, Sarah and Mary.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54085' title='54085'>'And here at my elbow is another portrait, taken at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Liverpool&t=h'>Liverpool</a>, of your younger sister, in the company of a man who appears to be a steward by his uniform. </span>
<span sid='54086' title='54086'>I observe that she was unmarried at the time.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54087' title='54087'>'You are very quick at observing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54088' title='54088'>'That is my trade.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54089' title='54089'>'Well, you are quite right. </span>
<span sid='54090' title='54090'>But she was married to Mr Browner a few days afterwards. </span>
<span sid='54091' title='54091'>He was on the South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n line when that was taken, but he was so fond of her that he couldn't abide to leave her for so long, and he got into the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Liverpool&t=h'>Liverpool</a> and <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> boats.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54092' title='54092'>'Ah, the Conqueror, perhaps?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54093' title='54093'>'No, the May Day, when last I heard. </span>
<span sid='54094' title='54094'>Jim came down here to see me once. </span>
<span sid='54095' title='54095'>That was before he broke the pledge; but afterwards he would always take drink when he was ashore, and a little drink would send him stark, staring mad. </span>
<span sid='54096' title='54096'>Ah! it was a bad day that ever he took a glass in his hand again. </span>
<span sid='54097' title='54097'>First he dropped me, and then he quarrelled with Sarah, and now that Mary has stopped writing we don't know how things are going with them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54098' title='54098'>It was evident that Miss Cushing had come upon a subject on which she felt very deeply. </span>
<span sid='54099' title='54099'>Like most people who lead a lonely life, she was shy at first, but ended by becoming extremely communicative. </span>
<span sid='54100' title='54100'>She told us many details about her brother-in-law the steward, and then wandering off on to the subject of her former lodgers, the medical students, she gave us a long account of their delinquencies, with their names and those of their hospitals. </span>
<span sid='54101' title='54101'>Holmes listened attentively to everything, throwing in a question from time to time.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54102' title='54102'>'About your second sister, Sarah,' said he. </span>
<span sid='54103' title='54103'>'I wonder, since you are both maiden ladies, that you do not keep house together.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54104' title='54104'>'Ah! you don't know Sarah's temper, or you would wonder no more. </span>
<span sid='54105' title='54105'>I tried it when I came to Croydon, and we kept on until about two months ago, when we had to part. </span>
<span sid='54106' title='54106'>I don't want to say a word against my own sister, but she was always meddlesome and hard to please, was Sarah.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54107' title='54107'>'You say that she quarrelled with your <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Liverpool&t=h'>Liverpool</a> relations.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54108' title='54108'>'Yes, and they were the best of friends at one time. </span>
<span sid='54109' title='54109'>Why, she went up there to live just in order to be near them. </span>
<span sid='54110' title='54110'>And now she has no word hard enough for Jim Browner. </span>
<span sid='54111' title='54111'>The last six months that she was here she would speak of nothing but his drinking and his ways. </span>
<span sid='54112' title='54112'>He had caught her meddling, I suspect, and given her a bit of his mind, and that was the start of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54113' title='54113'>'Thank you, Miss Cushing,' said Holmes, rising and bowing. </span>
<span sid='54114' title='54114'>'Your sister Sarah lives, I think you said, at New Street, Wallington? </span>
<span sid='54115' title='54115'>Good-bye, and I am very sorry that you should have been troubled over a case with which, as you say, you have nothing whatever to do.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54116' title='54116'>There was a cab passing as we came out, and Holmes hailed it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54117' title='54117'>'How far to Wallington?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54118' title='54118'>'Only about a mile, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54119' title='54119'>'Very good. </span>
<span sid='54120' title='54120'>Jump in, Watson. </span>
<span sid='54121' title='54121'>We must strike while the iron is hot. </span>
<span sid='54122' title='54122'>Simple as the case is, there have been one or two very instructive details in connection with it. </span>
<span sid='54123' title='54123'>Just pull up at a telegraph office as you pass, cabby.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54124' title='54124'>Holmes sent off a short wire, and for the rest of the drive lay back in the cab with his hat tilted over his nose to keep the sun from his face. </span>
<span sid='54125' title='54125'>Our driver pulled up at a house which was not unlike the one which we had just quitted. </span>
<span sid='54126' title='54126'>My companion ordered him to wait, and had his hand upon the knocker, when the door opened and a grave young gentleman in black, with a very shiny hat, appeared on the step.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54127' title='54127'>'Is Miss Sarah Cushing at home?' asked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54128' title='54128'>'Miss Sarah Cushing is extremely ill,' said he. </span>
<span sid='54129' title='54129'>'She has been suffering since yesterday from brain symptoms of great severity. </span>
<span sid='54130' title='54130'>As her medical adviser, I cannot possibly take the responsibility of allowing anyone to see her. </span>
<span sid='54131' title='54131'>I should recommend you to call again in ten days.' </span>
<span sid='54132' title='54132'>He drew on his gloves, closed the door, and marched off down the street.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54133' title='54133'>'Well, if we can't, we can't,' said Holmes, cheerfully.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54134' title='54134'>'Perhaps she could not, or would not have told you much.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54135' title='54135'>'I did not wish her to tell me anything. </span>
<span sid='54136' title='54136'>I only wanted to look at her. </span>
<span sid='54137' title='54137'>However, I think that I have got all that I want. </span>
<span sid='54138' title='54138'>Drive us to some decent hotel, cabby, where we may have some lunch, and afterwards we shall drop down upon friend Lestrade at the police-station.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54139' title='54139'>We had a pleasant little meal together, during which Holmes would talk about nothing but violins, narrating with great exultation how he had purchased his own Stradivarius, which was worth at least five hundred guineas, at a Jew broker's in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Tottenham Court Road&t=h'>Tottenham Court Road</a> for fifty-five shillings. </span>
<span sid='54140' title='54140'>This led him to Paganini, and we sat for an hour over a bottle of claret while he told me anecdote after anecdote of that extraordinary man. </span>
<span sid='54141' title='54141'>The afternoon was far advanced and the hot glare had softened into a mellow glow before we found ourselves at the police-station. </span>
<span sid='54142' title='54142'>Lestrade was waiting for us at the door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54143' title='54143'>'A telegram for you, Mr Holmes,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54144' title='54144'>'Ha! </span>
<span sid='54145' title='54145'>It is the answer!' </span>
<span sid='54146' title='54146'>He tore it open, glanced his eyes over it, and crumpled it into his pocket. </span>
<span sid='54147' title='54147'>'That's all right,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54148' title='54148'>'Have you found out anything?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54149' title='54149'>'I have found out everything!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54150' title='54150'>'What!' Lestrade stared at him in amazement. </span>
<span sid='54151' title='54151'>'You are joking.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54152' title='54152'>'I was never more serious in my life. </span>
<span sid='54153' title='54153'>A shocking crime has been committed, and I think that I have now laid bare every detail of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54154' title='54154'>'And the criminal?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54155' title='54155'>Holmes scribbled a few words upon the back of one of his visiting cards and threw it over to Lestrade.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54156' title='54156'>'That is it,' he said; 'you cannot effect an arrest until to-morrow night at the earliest. </span>
<span sid='54157' title='54157'>I should prefer that you would not mention my name at all in connection with the case, as I choose to be associated only with those crimes which present some difficulty in their solution. </span>
<span sid='54158' title='54158'>Come on, Watson.' </span>
<span sid='54159' title='54159'>We strode off together to the station, leaving Lestrade still staring with a delighted face at the card which Holmes had thrown him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54160' title='54160'>'The case,' said Sherlock Holmes, as we chatted over our cigars that night in our rooms at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>, 'is one where, as in the investigations which you have chronicled under the names of the 'Study in Scarlet' and of the 'Sign of Four,' we have been compelled to reason backward from effects to causes. </span>
<span sid='54161' title='54161'>I have written to Lestrade asking him to supply us with the details which are now wanting, and which he will only get after he has secured his man. </span>
<span sid='54162' title='54162'>That he may be safely trusted to do, for although he is absolutely devoid of reason, he is as tenacious as a bull-dog when he once understands what he has to do, and indeed it is just this tenacity which has brought him to the top at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54163' title='54163'>'Your case is not complete, then?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54164' title='54164'>'It is fairly complete in essentials. </span>
<span sid='54165' title='54165'>We know who the author of the revolting business is, although one of the victims still escapes us. </span>
<span sid='54166' title='54166'>Of course, you have formed your own conclusions.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54167' title='54167'>'I presume that this Jim Browner, the steward of a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Liverpool&t=h'>Liverpool</a> boat, is the man whom you suspect?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54168' title='54168'>'Oh! it is more than a suspicion.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54169' title='54169'>'And yet I cannot see anything save very vague indications.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54170' title='54170'>'On the contrary, to my mind nothing could be more clear. </span>
<span sid='54171' title='54171'>Let me run over the principal steps. </span>
<span sid='54172' title='54172'>We approached the case, you remember, with an absolutely blank mind, which is always an advantage. </span>
<span sid='54173' title='54173'>We had formed no theories.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54174' title='54174'>We were simply there to observe and to draw inferences from our observations. </span>
<span sid='54175' title='54175'>What did we see first? </span>
<span sid='54176' title='54176'>A very placid and respectable lady, who seemed quite innocent of any secret, and a portrait which showed me that she had two younger sisters. </span>
<span sid='54177' title='54177'>It instantly flashed across my mind that the box might have been meant for one of these. </span>
<span sid='54178' title='54178'>I set the idea aside as one which could be disproved or confirmed at our leisure. </span>
<span sid='54179' title='54179'>Then we went to the garden, as you remember, and we saw the very singular contents of the little yellow box.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54180' title='54180'>'The string was of the quality which is used by sail-makers aboard ship, and at once a whiff of the sea was perceptible in our investigation. </span>
<span sid='54181' title='54181'>When I observed that the knot was one which is popular with sailors, that the parcel had been posted at a port, and that the male ear was pierced for an earring which is so much more common among sailors than landsmen, I was quite certain that all the actors in the tragedy were to be found among our seafaring classes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54182' title='54182'>'When I came to examine the address of the packet I observed that it was to Miss S. Cushing. </span>
<span sid='54183' title='54183'>Now, the oldest sister would, of course, be Miss Cushing, and although her initial was "S.," it might belong to one of the others as well. </span>
<span sid='54184' title='54184'>In that case we should have to commence our investigation from a fresh basis altogether. </span>
<span sid='54185' title='54185'>I therefore went into the house with the intention of clearing up this point. </span>
<span sid='54186' title='54186'>I was about to assure Miss Cushing that I was convinced that a mistake had been made, when you may remember that I came suddenly to a stop. </span>
<span sid='54187' title='54187'>The fact was that I had just seen something which filled me with surprise, and at the same time narrowed the field of our inquiry immensely.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54188' title='54188'>'As a medical man, you are aware, Watson, that there is no part of the body which varies so much as the human ear. </span>
<span sid='54189' title='54189'>Each ear is as a rule quite distinctive, and differs from an other ones. </span>
<span sid='54190' title='54190'>In last year's Anthropological Journal you will find two short monographs from my pen upon the subject. </span>
<span sid='54191' title='54191'>I had therefore examined the ears in the box with the eyes of an expert, and had carefully noted their anatomical peculiarities. </span>
<span sid='54192' title='54192'>Imagine my surprise then, when, on looking at Miss Cushing, I perceived that her ear corresponded exactly with the female ear which I had just inspected. </span>
<span sid='54193' title='54193'>The matter was entirely beyond coincidence. </span>
<span sid='54194' title='54194'>There was the same shortening of the pinna, the same broad curve of the upper lobe, the same convolution of the inner cartilage. </span>
<span sid='54195' title='54195'>In all essentials it was the same ear.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54196' title='54196'>'Of course, I at once saw the enormous importance of the observation. </span>
<span sid='54197' title='54197'>It was evident that the victim was a blood relation, and probably a very close one. </span>
<span sid='54198' title='54198'>I began to talk to her about her family, and you remember that she at once gave us some exceedingly valuable details.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54199' title='54199'>'In the first place, her sister's name was Sarah, and her address had, until recently, been the same, so that it was quite obvious how the mistake had occurred, and whom the packet was meant for. </span>
<span sid='54200' title='54200'>Then we heard of this steward, married to the third sister, and learned that he had at one time been so intimate with Miss Sarah that she had actually gone up to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Liverpool&t=h'>Liverpool</a> to be near the Browners, but a quarrel had afterwards divided them. </span>
<span sid='54201' title='54201'>This quarrel had put a stop to all communications for some months, so that if Browner had occasion to address a packet to Miss Sarah, he would undoubtedly have done so to her old address.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54202' title='54202'>'And now the matter had begun to straighten itself out wonderfully. </span>
<span sid='54203' title='54203'>We had learned of the existence of this steward, an impulsive man, of strong passions - you remember that he threw up what must have been a very superior berth, in order to be nearer to his wife - subject, too, to occasional fits of hard drinking. </span>
<span sid='54204' title='54204'>We had reason to believe that his wife had been murdered, and that a man - presumably a seafaring man - had been murdered at the same time. </span>
<span sid='54205' title='54205'>Jealousy, of course, at once suggests itself as the motive for the crime. </span>
<span sid='54206' title='54206'>And why should these proofs of the deed be sent to Miss Sarah Cushing? </span>
<span sid='54207' title='54207'>Probably because during her residence in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Liverpool&t=h'>Liverpool</a> she had some hand in bringing about the events which led to the tragedy. </span>
<span sid='54208' title='54208'>You will observe that this line of boats calls at Belfast, Dublin, and Waterford; so that, presuming that Browner had committed the deed, and had embarked at once upon his steamer, the May Day, Belfast would be the first place at which he could post his terrible packet.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54209' title='54209'>'A second solution was at this stage obviously possible, and although I thought it exceedingly unlikely, I was determined to elucidate it before going further. </span>
<span sid='54210' title='54210'>An unsuccessful lover might have killed Mr and Mrs Browner, and the male ear might have belonged to the husband. </span>
<span sid='54211' title='54211'>There were many grave objections to this theory, but it was conceivable. </span>
<span sid='54212' title='54212'>I therefore sent off a telegram to my friend Algar, of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Liverpool&t=h'>Liverpool</a> force, and asked him to find out if Mrs Browner were at home, and if Browner had departed in the May Day. </span>
<span sid='54213' title='54213'>Then we went on to Wallington to visit Miss Sarah.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54214' title='54214'>'I was curious, in the first place, to see how far the family ear had been reproduced in her. </span>
<span sid='54215' title='54215'>Then, of course, she might give us very important information, but I was not sanguine that she would. </span>
<span sid='54216' title='54216'>She must have heard of the business the day before, since all Croydon was ringing with it, and she alone could have understood whom the packet was meant for. </span>
<span sid='54217' title='54217'>If she had been willing to help justice she would probably have communicated with the police already. </span>
<span sid='54218' title='54218'>However, it was clearly our duty to see her, so we went. </span>
<span sid='54219' title='54219'>We found that the news of the arrival of the packet - for her illness dated from that time - had such an effect upon her as to bring on brain fever. </span>
<span sid='54220' title='54220'>It was clearer than ever that she understood its full significance, but equally clear that we should have to wait some time for any assistance from her.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54221' title='54221'>'However, we were really independent of her help. </span>
<span sid='54222' title='54222'>Our answers were waiting for us at the police-station, where I had directed Algar to send them. </span>
<span sid='54223' title='54223'>Nothing could be more conclusive. </span>
<span sid='54224' title='54224'>Mrs Browner's house had been closed for more than three days, and the neighbours were of opinion that she had gone south to see her relatives. </span>
<span sid='54225' title='54225'>It had been ascertained at the shipping offices that Browner had left aboard of the May Day, and I calculate that she is due in the Thames tomorrow night. </span>
<span sid='54226' title='54226'>When he arrives he will be met by the obtuse but resolute Lestrade, and I have no doubt that we shall have all our details filled in.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54227' title='54227'>Sherlock Holmes was not disappointed in his expectations. </span>
<span sid='54228' title='54228'>Two days later he received a bulky envelope, which contained a short note from the detective, and a type-written document, which covered several pages of foolscap.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54229' title='54229'>'Lestrade has got him all right,' said Holmes, glancing up at me. </span>
<span sid='54230' title='54230'>'Perhaps it would interest you to hear what he says.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54231' title='54231'>'My dear Mr. Holmes, - In accordance with the scheme which we had formed in order to test our theories' - 'the "we" is rather fine, Watson, is it not?' - 'I went down to the Albert Dock yesterday at 6 p.m., and boarded the ss. </span>
<span sid='54232' title='54232'>May Day, belonging to the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Liverpool&t=h'>Liverpool</a>, Dublin, and <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> Steam Packet Company. </span>
<span sid='54233' title='54233'>On inquiry, I found that there was a steward on board of the name of James Browner, and that he had acted during the voyage in such an extraordinary manner that the captain had been compelled to relieve him of his duties. </span>
<span sid='54234' title='54234'>On descending to his berth, I found him seated upon a chest with his head sunk upon his hands, rocking himself to and fro. </span>
<span sid='54235' title='54235'>He is a big, powerful chap, clean-shaven, and very swarthy - something like Aldridge, who helped us in the bogus laundry affair. </span>
<span sid='54236' title='54236'>He jumped up when he heard my business, and I had my whistle to my lips to call a couple of river police, who were round the corner, but he seemed to have no heart in him, and he held out his hands quietly enough for the darbies. </span>
<span sid='54237' title='54237'>We brought him along to the cells, and his box as well, for we thought there might be something incriminating; but, bar a big sharp knife, such as most sailors have, we got nothing for our trouble. </span>
<span sid='54238' title='54238'>However, we find that we shall want no more evidence, for, on being brought before the inspector at the station, he asked leave to make a statement, which was, of course, taken down, just as he made it, by our shorthand man. </span>
<span sid='54239' title='54239'>We had three copies type-written, one of which I inclose. </span>
<span sid='54240' title='54240'>The affair proves, as I always thought it would, to be an extremely simple one, but I am obliged to you for assisting me in my investigation. </span>
<span sid='54241' title='54241'>With kind regards, yours very truly, </span>
<span sid='54242' title='54242'>- G. LESTRADE.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54243' title='54243'>'Hum! </span>
<span sid='54244' title='54244'>The investigation really was a very simple one,' remarked Holmes; 'but I don't think it struck him in that light when he first called us in. </span>
<span sid='54245' title='54245'>However, let us see what Jim Browner has to say for himself. </span>
<span sid='54246' title='54246'>This is his statement, as made before Inspector Montgomery at the Shadwell Police Station, and it has the advantage of being verbatim.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54247' title='54247'>'Have I anything to say? </span>
<span sid='54248' title='54248'>Yes, I have a deal to say. </span>
<span sid='54249' title='54249'>I have to make a clean breast of it all. </span>
<span sid='54250' title='54250'>You can hang me, or you can leave me alone. </span>
<span sid='54251' title='54251'>I don't care a plug which you do. </span>
<span sid='54252' title='54252'>I tell you I've not shut an eye in sleep since I did it, and I don't believe I ever will again until I get past all waking. </span>
<span sid='54253' title='54253'>Sometimes it's his face, but most generally it's hers. </span>
<span sid='54254' title='54254'>I'm never without one or the other before me. </span>
<span sid='54255' title='54255'>He looks frowning and black-like, but she has a kind o' surprise upon her face. </span>
<span sid='54256' title='54256'>Aye, the white lamb, she might well be surprised when she read death on a face that had seldom looked anything but love upon her before.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54257' title='54257'>'But it was Sarah's fault, and may the curse of a broken man put a blight on her and set the blood rotting in her veins! </span>
<span sid='54258' title='54258'>It's not that I want to clear myself. </span>
<span sid='54259' title='54259'>I know that I went back to drink, like the beast that I was. </span>
<span sid='54260' title='54260'>But she would have forgiven me; she would have stuck as close to me as a rope to a block if that woman had never darkened our door. </span>
<span sid='54261' title='54261'>For Sarah Cushing loved me - that's the root of the business-she loved me, until all her love turned to poisonous hate when she knew that I thought more of my wife's footmark in the mud than I did of her whole body and soul.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54262' title='54262'>'There were three sisters altogether. </span>
<span sid='54263' title='54263'>The old one was just a good woman, the second was a devil, and the third was an angel. </span>
<span sid='54264' title='54264'>Sarah was thirty-three, and Mary was twenty-nine when I married. </span>
<span sid='54265' title='54265'>We were just as happy as the day was long when we set up house together, and in all <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Liverpool&t=h'>Liverpool</a> there was no better woman than my Mary. </span>
<span sid='54266' title='54266'>And then we asked Sarah up for a week, and the week grew into a month, and one thing led to another, until she was just one of ourselves.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54267' title='54267'>'I was blue ribbon at that time, and we were putting a little money by, and all was as bright as a new dollar. </span>
<span sid='54268' title='54268'>My God, whoever would have thought that it could have come to this? </span>
<span sid='54269' title='54269'>Whoever would have dreamed it?</span>
<p>
<span sid='54270' title='54270'>'I used to be home for the week-ends very often, and sometimes if the ship were held back for cargo I would have a whole week at a time, and in this way I saw a deal of my sister-in-law, Sarah. </span>
<span sid='54271' title='54271'>She was a fine tall woman, black and quick and fierce, with a proud way of carrying her head, and a glint from her eye like the spark from a flint. </span>
<span sid='54272' title='54272'>But when little Mary was there I had never a thought for her, and that I swear as I hope for God's mercy.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54273' title='54273'>'It had seemed to me sometimes that she liked to be alone with me, or to coax me out for a walk with her, but I had never thought anything of that. </span>
<span sid='54274' title='54274'>But one evening my eyes were opened. </span>
<span sid='54275' title='54275'>I had come up from the ship and found my wife out, but Sarah at home. </span>
<span sid='54276' title='54276'>"Where's Mary?" I asked. </span>
<span sid='54277' title='54277'>"Oh, she has gone to pay some accounts." </span>
<span sid='54278' title='54278'>I was impatient and paced up and down the room. </span>
<span sid='54279' title='54279'>"Can't you be happy for five minutes without Mary, Jim?" says she. </span>
<span sid='54280' title='54280'>"It's a bad compliment to me that you can't be contented with my society for so short a time." </span>
<span sid='54281' title='54281'>"That's all right, my lass," said I, putting out my hand towards her in a kindly way, but she had it in both hers in an instant, and they burned as if they were in a fever. </span>
<span sid='54282' title='54282'>I looked into her eyes and I read it all there. </span>
<span sid='54283' title='54283'>There was no need for her to speak, nor for me either. </span>
<span sid='54284' title='54284'>I frowned and drew my hand away. </span>
<span sid='54285' title='54285'>Then she stood by my side in silence for a bit, and then put up her hand and patted me on the shoulder. </span>
<span sid='54286' title='54286'>"Steady old Jim!" said she; and, with a kind o' mocking laugh, she ran out of the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54287' title='54287'>'Well, from that time Sarah hated me with her whole heart and soul, and she is a woman who can hate, too. </span>
<span sid='54288' title='54288'>I was a fool to let her go on biding with us - a besotted fool - but I never said a word to Mary, for I knew it would grieve her. </span>
<span sid='54289' title='54289'>Things went on much as before, but after a time I began to find that there was a bit of a change in Mary herself. </span>
<span sid='54290' title='54290'>She had always been so trusting and so innocent, but now she became queer and suspicious, wanting to know where I had been and what I had been doing, and whom my letters were from, and what I had in my pockets, and a thousand such follies. </span>
<span sid='54291' title='54291'>Day by day she grew queerer and more irritable, and we had causeless rows about nothing. </span>
<span sid='54292' title='54292'>I was fairly puzzled by it all. </span>
<span sid='54293' title='54293'>Sarah avoided me now, but she and Mary were just inseparable. </span>
<span sid='54294' title='54294'>I can see now how she was plotting and scheming and poisoning my wife's mind against me, but I was such a blind beetle that I could not understand it at the time. </span>
<span sid='54295' title='54295'>Then I broke my blue ribbon and began to drink again, but I think I should not have done it if Mary had been the same as ever. </span>
<span sid='54296' title='54296'>She had some reason to be disgusted with me now, and the gap between us began to be wider and wider. </span>
<span sid='54297' title='54297'>And then this Alec Fairbairn chipped in, and things became a thousand times blacker.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54298' title='54298'>'It was to see Sarah that he came to my house first, but soon it was to see us, for he was a man with winning ways, and he made friends wherever he went. </span>
<span sid='54299' title='54299'>He was a dashing, swaggering chap, smart and curled, who had seen half the world, and could talk of what he had seen. </span>
<span sid='54300' title='54300'>He was good company, I won't deny it, and he had wonderful polite ways with him for a sailor man, so that I think there must have been a time when he knew more of the poop than the forecastle. </span>
<span sid='54301' title='54301'>For a month he was in and out of my house, and never once did it cross my mind that harm might come of his soft, tricky ways. </span>
<span sid='54302' title='54302'>And then at last something made me suspect, and from that day my peace was gone for ever.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54303' title='54303'>'It was only a little thing, too. </span>
<span sid='54304' title='54304'>I had come into the parlour unexpected, and as I walked in at the door I saw a light of welcome on my wife's face. </span>
<span sid='54305' title='54305'>But as she saw who it was it faded again, and she turned away with a look of disappointment. </span>
<span sid='54306' title='54306'>That was enough for me. </span>
<span sid='54307' title='54307'>There was no one but Alec Fairbairn whose step she could have mistaken for mine. </span>
<span sid='54308' title='54308'>If I could have seen him then I should have killed him, for I have always been like a madman when my temper gets loose. </span>
<span sid='54309' title='54309'>Mary saw the devil's light in my eyes, and she ran forward with her hands on my sleeve. </span>
<span sid='54310' title='54310'>"Don't, Jim, don't!" says she. </span>
<span sid='54311' title='54311'>"Where's Sarah?" I asked. </span>
<span sid='54312' title='54312'>"In the kitchen," says she. </span>
<span sid='54313' title='54313'>"Sarah," says I, as I went in, "this man Fairbairn is never to darken my door again.""Why not?" says she. </span>
<span sid='54314' title='54314'>"Because I order it." </span>
<span sid='54315' title='54315'>"Oh!" says she, "if my friends are not good enough for this house, then I am not good enough for it either.""You can do what you like," says I, "but if Fairbairn shows his face here again, I'll send you one of his ears for a keepsake." </span>
<span sid='54316' title='54316'>She was frightened by my face, I think, for she never answered a word, and the same evening she left my house.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54317' title='54317'>'Well, I don't know now whether it was pure devilry on the part of this woman, or whether she thought that she could turn me against my wife by encouraging her to misbehave. </span>
<span sid='54318' title='54318'>Anyway, she took a house just two streets off, and let lodgings to sailors. </span>
<span sid='54319' title='54319'>Fairbairn used to stay there, and Mary would go round to have tea with her sister and him. </span>
<span sid='54320' title='54320'>How often she went I don't know, but I followed her one day, and as I broke in at the door Fairbairn got away over the back garden wall, like the cowardly skunk that he was. </span>
<span sid='54321' title='54321'>I swore to my wife that I would kill her if I found her in his company again, and I led her back with me, sobbing and trembling, and as white as a piece of paper. </span>
<span sid='54322' title='54322'>There was no trace of love between us any longer. </span>
<span sid='54323' title='54323'>I could see that she hated me and feared me, and when the thought of it drove me to drink, then she despised me as well.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54324' title='54324'>'Well, Sarah found that she could not make a living in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Liverpool&t=h'>Liverpool</a>, so she went back, as I understand, to live with her sister in Croydon, and things jogged on much the same as ever at home. </span>
<span sid='54325' title='54325'>And then came this last week and all the misery and ruin.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54326' title='54326'>'It was in this way. </span>
<span sid='54327' title='54327'>We had gone on the May Day for a round voyage of seven days, but a hogshead got loose and started one of our plates, so that we had to put back into port for twelve hours. </span>
<span sid='54328' title='54328'>I left the ship and came home, thinking what a surprise it would be for my wife, and hoping that maybe she would be glad to see me so soon. </span>
<span sid='54329' title='54329'>The thought was in my head as I turned into my own street, and at that moment a cab passed me, and there she was, sitting by the side of Fairbairn, the two chatting and laughing, with never a thought for me as I stood watching them from the footpath.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54330' title='54330'>'I tell you, and I give you my word on it, that from that moment I was not my own master, and it is all like a dim dream when I look back on it. </span>
<span sid='54331' title='54331'>I had been drinking hard of late, and the two things together fairly turned my brain. </span>
<span sid='54332' title='54332'>There's something throbbing in my head now, like a docker's hammer, but that morning I seemed to have all <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Niagara&t=h'>Niagara</a> whizzing and buzzing in my ears.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54333' title='54333'>'Well, I took to my heels, and I ran after the cab. </span>
<span sid='54334' title='54334'>I had a heavy oak stick in my hand, and I tell you that I saw red from the first; but as I ran I got cunning, too, and hung back a little to see them without being seen. </span>
<span sid='54335' title='54335'>They pulled up soon at the railway station. </span>
<span sid='54336' title='54336'>There was a good crowd round the booking-office, so I got quite close to them without being seen. </span>
<span sid='54337' title='54337'>They took tickets for New Brighton. </span>
<span sid='54338' title='54338'>So did I, but I got in three carriages behind them. </span>
<span sid='54339' title='54339'>When we reached it they walked along the Parade, and I was never more than a hundred yards from them. </span>
<span sid='54340' title='54340'>At last I saw them hire a boat and start for a row, for it was a very hot day, and they thought no doubt that it would be cooler on the water.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54341' title='54341'>'It was just as if they had been given into my hands. </span>
<span sid='54342' title='54342'>There was a bit of a haze, and you could not see more than a few hundred yards. </span>
<span sid='54343' title='54343'>I hired a boat for myself, and I pulled after them. </span>
<span sid='54344' title='54344'>I could see the blurr of their craft, but they were going nearly as fast as I, and they must have been a long mile from the shore before I caught them up. </span>
<span sid='54345' title='54345'>The haze was like a curtain all round us, and there were we three in the middle of it. </span>
<span sid='54346' title='54346'>My God, shall I ever forget their faces when they saw who was in the boat that was closing in upon them? </span>
<span sid='54347' title='54347'>She screamed out. </span>
<span sid='54348' title='54348'>He swore like a madman, and jabbed at me with an oar, for he must have seen death in my eyes. </span>
<span sid='54349' title='54349'>I got past it and got one in with my stick, that crushed his head like an egg. </span>
<span sid='54350' title='54350'>I would have spared her, perhaps, for all my madness, but she threw her arms round him, crying out to him, and calling him "Alec." </span>
<span sid='54351' title='54351'>I struck again, and she lay stretched beside him. </span>
<span sid='54352' title='54352'>I was like a wild beast then that had tasted blood. </span>
<span sid='54353' title='54353'>If Sarah had been there, by the Lord, she should have joined them. </span>
<span sid='54354' title='54354'>I pulled out my knife, and - well, there! </span>
<span sid='54355' title='54355'>I've said enough. </span>
<span sid='54356' title='54356'>It gave me a kind of savage joy when I thought how Sarah would feel when she had such signs as these of what her meddling had brought about. </span>
<span sid='54357' title='54357'>Then I tied the bodies into the boat, stove a plank, and stood by until they had sunk. </span>
<span sid='54358' title='54358'>I knew very well that the owner would think that they had lost their bearings in the haze, and had drifted off out to sea. </span>
<span sid='54359' title='54359'>I cleaned myself up, got back to land, and joined my ship without a soul having a suspicion of what had passed. </span>
<span sid='54360' title='54360'>That night I made up the packet for Sarah Cushing, and next day I sent it from Belfast.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54361' title='54361'>'There you have the whole truth of it. </span>
<span sid='54362' title='54362'>You can hang me, or do what you like with me, but you cannot punish me as I have been punished already. </span>
<span sid='54363' title='54363'>I cannot shut my eyes but I see those two faces staring at me - staring at me as they stared when my boat broke through the haze. </span>
<span sid='54364' title='54364'>I killed them quick, but they are killing me slow; and if I have another night of it I shall be either mad or dead before morning. </span>
<span sid='54365' title='54365'>You won't put me alone into a cell, sir? </span>
<span sid='54366' title='54366'>For pity's sake don't, and may you be treated in your day of agony as you treat me now.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54367' title='54367'>'What is the meaning of it, Watson?' said Holmes, solemnly, as he laid down the paper. </span>
<span sid='54368' title='54368'>'What object is served by this circle of misery and violence and fear? </span>
<span sid='54369' title='54369'>It must tend to some end, or else our universe is ruled by chance, which is unthinkable. </span>
<span sid='54370' title='54370'>But what end? </span>
<span sid='54371' title='54371'>There is the great standing perennial problem to which human reason is as far from an answer as ever.'</span>
