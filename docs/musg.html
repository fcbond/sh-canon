<h1><span sid='38918' title='38918'>The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual</span></h1>
<p class="subtitle">Arthur Conan Doyle<label for="sn-meta-musg" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-meta-musg" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><!--googleoff: all--><b>Story Number</b>: 20<br><b>Published in</b>: The Strand Magazine in May 1893<br><b>Collected in</b>: The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes<!--googleon: all--></span></p>
<p>
<span sid='38919' title='38919'>An anomaly which often struck me in the character of my friend Sherlock Holmes was that, although in his methods of thought he was the neatest and most methodical of mankind, and although also he affected a certain quiet primness of dress, he was none the less in his personal habits one of the most untidy men that ever drove a fellow-lodger to distraction. </span>
<span sid='38920' title='38920'>Not that I am in the least conventional in that respect myself. </span>
<span sid='38921' title='38921'>The rough-and-tumble work in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Afghanistan&t=h'>Afghanistan</a>, coming on the top of a natural <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bohemia&t=h'>Bohemia</a>nism of disposition, has made me rather more lax than befits a medical man. </span>
<span sid='38922' title='38922'>But with me there is a limit, and when I find a man who keeps his cigars in the coal-scuttle, his tobacco in the toe end of a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Persia&t=h'>Persia</a>n slipper, and his unanswered correspondence transfixed by a jack-knife into the very centre of his wooden mantelpiece, then I begin to give myself virtuous airs. </span>
<span sid='38923' title='38923'>I have always held, too, that pistol practice should distinctly be an open-air pastime; and when Holmes in one of his queer humours would sit in an arm-chair, with his hair-trigger and a hundred Boxer cartridges, and proceed to adorn the opposite wall with a patriotic V.R. done in bullet-pocks, I felt strongly that neither the atmosphere nor the appearance of our room was improved by it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38924' title='38924'>Our chambers were always full of chemicals and of criminal relics, which had a way of wandering into unlikely positions, and of turning up in the butter-dish, or in even less desirable places. </span>
<span sid='38925' title='38925'>But his papers were my great crux. </span>
<span sid='38926' title='38926'>He had a horror of destroying documents, especially those which were connected with his past cases, and yet it was only once in every year or two that he would muster energy to docket and arrange them, for, as I have mentioned somewhere in these incoherent memoirs, the outbursts of passionate energy when he performed the remarkable feats with which his name is associated were followed by reactions of lethargy, during which he would lie about with his violin and his books, hardly moving, save from the sofa to the table. </span>
<span sid='38927' title='38927'>Thus month after month his papers accumulated, until every corner of the room was stacked with bundles of manuscript which were on no account to be burned, and which could not be put away save by their owner.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38928' title='38928'>One winter's night, as we sat together by the fire, I ventured to suggest to him that as he had finished pasting extracts into his commonplace book he might employ the next two hours in making our room a little more habitable. </span>
<span sid='38929' title='38929'>He could not deny the justice of my request, so with a rather rueful face he went off to his bedroom, from which he returned presently pulling a large tin box behind him. </span>
<span sid='38930' title='38930'>This he placed in the middle of the floor, and squatting down upon a stool in front of it he threw back the lid. </span>
<span sid='38931' title='38931'>I could see that it was already a third full of bundles of paper tied up with red tape into separate packages.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38932' title='38932'>'There are cases enough here, Watson,' said he, looking at me with mischievous eyes. </span>
<span sid='38933' title='38933'>'I think that if you knew all that I have in this box you would ask me to pull some out instead of putting others in.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38934' title='38934'>'These are the records of your early work, then?' I asked. </span>
<span sid='38935' title='38935'>'I have often wished that I had notes of those cases.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38936' title='38936'>'Yes, my boy; these were all done prematurely before my biographer had come to glorify me.' </span>
<span sid='38937' title='38937'>He lifted bundle after bundle in a tender, caressing sort of way. </span>
<span sid='38938' title='38938'>'They are not all successes, Watson,' said he, 'but there are some pretty little problems among them. </span>
<span sid='38939' title='38939'>Here's the record of the Tarleton murders and the case of Vamberry, the wine merchant, and the adventure of the old <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Russia&t=h'>Russia</a>n woman, and the singular affair of the aluminium crutch, as well as a full account of Ricoletti of the club foot and his abominable wife. </span>
<span sid='38940' title='38940'>And here - ah, now! this really is something a little recherché.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38941' title='38941'>He dived his arm down to the bottom of the chest, and brought up a small wooden box, with a sliding lid, such as children's toys are kept in. </span>
<span sid='38942' title='38942'>From within he produced a crumpled piece of paper, an old-fashioned brass key, a peg of wood with a ball of string attached to it, and three rusty old discs of metal.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38943' title='38943'>'Well, my boy, what do you make of this lot?' he asked, smiling at my expression.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38944' title='38944'>'It is a curious collection.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38945' title='38945'>'Very curious; and the story that hangs round it will strike you as being more curious still.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38946' title='38946'>'These relics have a history, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38947' title='38947'>'So much so that they are history.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38948' title='38948'>'What do you mean by that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38949' title='38949'>Sherlock Holmes picked them up one by one, and laid them along the edge of the table. </span>
<span sid='38950' title='38950'>Then he re-seated himself in his chair, and looked them over with a gleam of satisfaction in his eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38951' title='38951'>'These,' said he, 'are all that I have left to remind me of the episode of the Musgrave Ritual.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38952' title='38952'>I had heard him mention the case more than once, though I had never been able to gather the details.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38953' title='38953'>'I should be so glad,' said I, 'if you would give me an account of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38954' title='38954'>'And leave the litter as it is?' he cried, mischievously. </span>
<span sid='38955' title='38955'>'Your tidiness won't bear much strain, after all, Watson. </span>
<span sid='38956' title='38956'>But I should be glad that you should add this case to your annals, for there are points in it which make it quite unique in the criminal records of this or, I believe, of any other country. </span>
<span sid='38957' title='38957'>A collection of my trifling achievements would certainly be incomplete which contained no account of this very singular business.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38958' title='38958'>'You may remember how the affair of the Gloria Scott, and my conversation with the unhappy man whose fate I told you of, first turned my attention in the direction of the profession which has become my life's work. </span>
<span sid='38959' title='38959'>You see me now when my name has become known far and wide, and when I am generally recognised both by the public and by the official force as being a final court of appeal in doubtful cases. </span>
<span sid='38960' title='38960'>Even when you knew me first, at the time of the affair which you have commemorated in A Study in Scarlet, I had already established a considerable, though not a very lucrative, connection. </span>
<span sid='38961' title='38961'>You can hardly realize, then, how difficult I found it at first, and how long I had to wait before I succeeded in making any headway.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38962' title='38962'>'When I first came up to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> I had rooms in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Montague Street&t=h'>Montague Street</a>, just round the corner from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the British Museum&t=h'>the British Museum</a>, and there I waited, filling in my too abundant leisure time by studying all those branches of science which might make me more efficient. </span>
<span sid='38963' title='38963'>Now and again cases came in my way, principally through the introduction of old fellow students, for during my last years at the university there was a good deal of talk there about myself and my methods. </span>
<span sid='38964' title='38964'>The third of these cases was that of the Musgrave Ritual, and it is to the interest which was aroused by that singular chain of events, and the large issues which proved to be at stake, that I trace my first stride towards the position which I now hold.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38965' title='38965'>'Reginald Musgrave had been in the same college as myself, and I had some slight acquaintance with him. </span>
<span sid='38966' title='38966'>He was not generally popular among the undergraduates, though it always seemed to me that what was set down as pride was really an attempt to cover extreme natural diffidence. </span>
<span sid='38967' title='38967'>In appearance he was a man of an exceedingly aristocratic type, thin, high-nosed, and large-eyed, with languid and yet courtly manners. </span>
<span sid='38968' title='38968'>He was indeed a scion of one of the very oldest families in the kingdom, though his branch was a cadet one which had separated from the northern Musgraves some time in the sixteenth century, and had established itself in western <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sussex&t=h'>Sussex</a>, where the manor house of Hurlstone is perhaps the oldest inhabited building in the county. </span>
<span sid='38969' title='38969'>Something of his birthplace seemed to cling to the man, and I never looked at his pale, keen face, or the poise of his head, without associating him with grey archways and mullioned windows and all the venerable wreckage of a feudal keep. </span>
<span sid='38970' title='38970'>Now and again we drifted into talk, and I can remember that more than once he expressed a keen interest in my methods of observation and inference.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38971' title='38971'>'For four years I had seen nothing of him, until one morning he walked into my room in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Montague Street&t=h'>Montague Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='38972' title='38972'>He had changed little, was dressed like a young man of fashion - he was always a bit of a dandy - and preserved the same quiet, suave manner which had formerly distinguished him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38973' title='38973'>'"How has all gone with you, Musgrave?" I asked, after we had cordially shaken hands.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38974' title='38974'>'"You probably heard of my poor father's death," said he. </span>
<span sid='38975' title='38975'>"He was carried off about two years ago. </span>
<span sid='38976' title='38976'>Since then I have, of course, had the Hurlstone estates to manage, and as I am member for the district as well, my life has been a busy one; but I understand, Holmes, that you are turning to practical ends those powers with which you used to amaze us."</span>
<p>
<span sid='38977' title='38977'>"Yes," said I, "I have taken to living by my wits."</span>
<p>
<span sid='38978' title='38978'>"I am delighted to hear it, for your advice at present would be exceedingly valuable to me. </span>
<span sid='38979' title='38979'>We have had some very strange doings at Hurlstone, and the police have been able to throw no light upon the matter. </span>
<span sid='38980' title='38980'>It is really the most extraordinary and inexplicable business."</span>
<p>
<span sid='38981' title='38981'>'You can imagine with what eagerness I listened to him, Watson, for the very chance for which I had been panting during all those months of inaction seemed to have come within my reach. </span>
<span sid='38982' title='38982'>In my inmost heart I believed that I could succeed where others failed, and now I had the opportunity to test myself.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38983' title='38983'>'"Pray let me have the details," I cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38984' title='38984'>'Reginald Musgrave sat down opposite to me, and lit the cigarette which I had pushed towards him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38985' title='38985'>'"You must know," said he, "that though I am a bachelor I have to keep up a considerable staff of servants at Hurlstone, for it is a rambling old place, and takes a good deal of looking after. </span>
<span sid='38986' title='38986'>I preserve, too, and in the pheasant months I usually have a house party, so that it would not do to be short-handed. </span>
<span sid='38987' title='38987'>Altogether there are eight maids, the cook, the butler, two footmen, and a boy. </span>
<span sid='38988' title='38988'>The garden and the stables, of course, have a separate staff.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38989' title='38989'>'"Of these servants the one who had been longest in our service was Brunton, the butler. </span>
<span sid='38990' title='38990'>He was a young schoolmaster out of place when he was first taken up by my father, but he was a man of great energy and character, and he soon became quite invaluable in the household. </span>
<span sid='38991' title='38991'>He was a well-grown, handsome man, with a splendid forehead, and though he has been with us for twenty years he cannot be more than forty now. </span>
<span sid='38992' title='38992'>With his personal advantages and his extraordinary gifts, for he can speak several languages and play nearly every musical instrument, it is wonderful that he should have been satisfied so long in such a position, but I suppose that he was comfortable and lacked energy to make any change. </span>
<span sid='38993' title='38993'>The butler of Hurlstone is always a thing that is remembered by all who visit us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38994' title='38994'>'"But this paragon has one fault. </span>
<span sid='38995' title='38995'>He is a bit of a Don Juan, and you can imagine that for a man like him it is not a very difficult part to play in a quiet country district.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38996' title='38996'>'"When he was married it was all right, but since he has been a widower we have had no end of trouble with him. </span>
<span sid='38997' title='38997'>A few months ago we were in hopes that he was about to settle down again, for he became engaged to Rachel Howells, our second housemaid, but he has thrown her over since then and taken up with Janet Tregellis, the daughter of the head gamekeeper. </span>
<span sid='38998' title='38998'>Rachel, who is a very good girl, but of an excitable Welsh temperament, had a sharp touch of brain fever, and goes about the house now - or did until yesterday - like a black-eyed shadow of her former self. </span>
<span sid='38999' title='38999'>That was our first drama at Hurlstone, but a second one came to drive it from our minds, and it was prefaced by the disgrace and dismissal of butler Brunton.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39000' title='39000'>'"This is how it came about. </span>
<span sid='39001' title='39001'>I have said that the man was intelligent, and this very intelligence has caused his ruin, for it seems to have led to an insatiable curiosity about things which did not in the least concern him. </span>
<span sid='39002' title='39002'>I had no idea of the lengths to which this would carry him until the merest accident opened my eyes to it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39003' title='39003'>'"I have said that the house is a rambling one. </span>
<span sid='39004' title='39004'>One night last week - on Thursday night, to be more exact - I found that I could not sleep, having foolishly taken a cup of strong café noir after my dinner. </span>
<span sid='39005' title='39005'>After struggling against it until two in the morning I felt that it was quite hopeless, so I rose and lit the candle with the intention of continuing a novel which I was reading. </span>
<span sid='39006' title='39006'>The book, however, had been left in the billiard-room, so I pulled on my dressing-gown and started off to get it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39007' title='39007'>'"In order to reach the billiard-room I had to descend a flight of stairs, and then to cross the head of the passage which led to the library and the gun-room. </span>
<span sid='39008' title='39008'>You can imagine my surprise when as I looked down this corridor I saw a glimmer of light coming from the open door of the library. </span>
<span sid='39009' title='39009'>I had myself extinguished the lamp and closed the door before coming to bed. </span>
<span sid='39010' title='39010'>Naturally, my first thought was of burglars. </span>
<span sid='39011' title='39011'>The corridors at Hurlstone have their walls largely decorated with trophies of old weapons. </span>
<span sid='39012' title='39012'>From one of these I picked a battle-axe, and then, leaving my candle behind me, I crept on tip-toe down the passage and peeped in at the open door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39013' title='39013'>'" Brunton, the butler, was in the library. </span>
<span sid='39014' title='39014'>He was sitting, fully dressed, in an easy chair, with a slip of paper, which looked like a map, upon his knee, and his forehead sunk forward upon his hand in deep thought. </span>
<span sid='39015' title='39015'>I stood, dumb with astonishment, watching him from the darkness. </span>
<span sid='39016' title='39016'>A small taper on the edge of the table shed a feeble light, which sufficed to show me that he was fully dressed. </span>
<span sid='39017' title='39017'>Suddenly, as I looked, he rose from his chair, and walking over to a bureau at the side, he unlocked it and drew out one of the drawers. </span>
<span sid='39018' title='39018'>From this he took a paper, and, returning to his seat, he flattened it out beside the taper on the edge of the table, and began to study it with minute attention. </span>
<span sid='39019' title='39019'>My indignation at this calm examination of our family documents overcame me so far that I took a step forward, and Brunton looking up saw me standing in the doorway. </span>
<span sid='39020' title='39020'>He sprang to his feet, his face turned livid with fear, and he thrust into his breast the chart-like paper which he had been originally studying.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39021' title='39021'>'"'So!' said I, 'this is how you repay the trust which we have reposed in you! </span>
<span sid='39022' title='39022'>You will leave my service tomorrow.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39023' title='39023'>'"He bowed with the look of a man who is utterly crushed, and slunk past me without a word. </span>
<span sid='39024' title='39024'>The taper was still on the table, and by its light I glanced to see what the paper was which Brunton had taken from the bureau. </span>
<span sid='39025' title='39025'>To my surprise it was nothing of any importance at all, but simply a copy of the questions and answers in the singular old observance called the Musgrave Ritual. </span>
<span sid='39026' title='39026'>It is a sort of ceremony peculiar to our family, which each Musgrave for centuries past has gone through upon his coming of age - a thing of private interest, and perhaps of some little importance to the archaeologist, like our own blazonings and charges, but of no practical use whatever."</span>
<p>
<span sid='39027' title='39027'>'"We had better come back to the paper afterwards," said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39028' title='39028'>'"If you think it really necessary," he answered, with some hesitation. </span>
<span sid='39029' title='39029'>"To continue my statement, however, I re-locked the bureau, using the key which Brunton had left, and I had turned to go, when I was surprised to find that the butler had returned and was standing before me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39030' title='39030'>'"'Mr Musgrave, sir,' he cried, in a voice which was hoarse with emotion, 'I can't bear disgrace, sir. </span>
<span sid='39031' title='39031'>I've always been proud above my station in life, and disgrace would kill me. </span>
<span sid='39032' title='39032'>My blood will be on your head, sir - it will, indeed - if you drive me to despair. </span>
<span sid='39033' title='39033'>If you cannot keep me after what has passed, then for God's sake let me give you notice and leave in a month, as if of my own free will. </span>
<span sid='39034' title='39034'>I could stand that, Mr Musgrave, but not to be cast out before all the folk that I know so well.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39035' title='39035'>'"'You don't deserve much consideration, Brunton,' I answered. </span>
<span sid='39036' title='39036'>'Your conduct has been most infamous. </span>
<span sid='39037' title='39037'>However, as you have been a long time in the family, I have no wish to bring public disgrace upon you. </span>
<span sid='39038' title='39038'>A month, however, is too long. </span>
<span sid='39039' title='39039'>Take yourself away in a week, and give what reason you like for going.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39040' title='39040'>"'Only a week, sir?" he cried in a despairing voice. </span>
<span sid='39041' title='39041'>'A fortnight - say at least a fortnight.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39042' title='39042'>'"'A week,' I repeated, 'and you may consider yourself to have been very leniently dealt with.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39043' title='39043'>'"He crept away, his face sunk upon his breast, like a broken man, while I put out the light and returned to my room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39044' title='39044'>'"For two days after this Brunton was most assiduous in his attention to his duties. </span>
<span sid='39045' title='39045'>I made no allusion to what had passed, and waited with some curiosity to see how he would cover his disgrace. </span>
<span sid='39046' title='39046'>On the third morning, however, he did not appear, as was his custom, after breakfast to receive my instructions for the day. </span>
<span sid='39047' title='39047'>As I left the dining-room I happened to meet Rachel Howells, the maid. </span>
<span sid='39048' title='39048'>I have told you that she had only recently recovered from an illness, and was looking so wretchedly pale and wan that I remonstrated with her for being at work.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39049' title='39049'>'"'You should be in bed,' I said. </span>
<span sid='39050' title='39050'>'Come back to your duties when you are stronger.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39051' title='39051'>'"She looked at me with so strange an expression that I began to suspect that her brain was affected.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39052' title='39052'>'"'I am strong enough, Mr Musgrave,' said she.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39053' title='39053'>'"'We will see what the doctor says,' I answered. </span>
<span sid='39054' title='39054'>'You must stop work now, and when you go downstairs just say that I wish to see Brunton.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39055' title='39055'>'"'The butler is gone,' said she.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39056' title='39056'>'"'Gone! </span>
<span sid='39057' title='39057'>Gone where?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39058' title='39058'>'"'He is gone. </span>
<span sid='39059' title='39059'>No one has seen him. </span>
<span sid='39060' title='39060'>He is not in his room. </span>
<span sid='39061' title='39061'>Oh, yes, he is gone - he is gone!' </span>
<span sid='39062' title='39062'>She fell back against the wall with shriek after shriek of laughter, while I, horrified at this sudden hysterical attack, rushed to the bell to summon help. </span>
<span sid='39063' title='39063'>The girl was taken to her room, still screaming and sobbing, while I made inquiries about Brunton. </span>
<span sid='39064' title='39064'>There was no doubt about it that he had disappeared. </span>
<span sid='39065' title='39065'>His bed had not been slept in; he had been seen by no one since he had retired to his room the night before; and yet it was difficult to see how he could have left the house, as both windows and doors were found to be fastened in the morning. </span>
<span sid='39066' title='39066'>His clothes, his watch, and even his money were in his room - but the black suit which he usually wore was missing. </span>
<span sid='39067' title='39067'>His slippers, too, were gone, but his boots were left behind. </span>
<span sid='39068' title='39068'>Where, then, could butler Brunton have gone in the night, and what could have become of him now?</span>
<p>
<span sid='39069' title='39069'>'"Of course we searched the house and the outhouses, but there was no trace of him. </span>
<span sid='39070' title='39070'>It is, as I have said, a labyrinth of an old building, especially the original wing, which is now practically uninhabited, but we ransacked every room and attic without discovering the least sign of the missing man. </span>
<span sid='39071' title='39071'>It was incredible to me that he could have gone away leaving all his property behind him, and yet where could he be? </span>
<span sid='39072' title='39072'>I called in the local police, but without success. </span>
<span sid='39073' title='39073'>Rain had fallen on the night before, and we examined the lawn and the paths all round the house, but in vain. </span>
<span sid='39074' title='39074'>Matters were in this state when a new development quite drew our attention away from the original mystery.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39075' title='39075'>'"For two days Rachel Howells had been so ill, sometimes delirious, sometimes hysterical, that a nurse had been employed to sit up with her at night. </span>
<span sid='39076' title='39076'>On the third night after Brunton's disappearance, the nurse, finding her patient sleeping nicely, had dropped into a nap in the arm-chair, when she woke in the early morning to find the bed empty, the window open, and no signs of the invalid. </span>
<span sid='39077' title='39077'>I was instantly aroused, and with the two footmen started off at once in search of the missing girl. </span>
<span sid='39078' title='39078'>It was not difficult to tell the direction which she had taken, for, starting from under her window, we could follow her footmarks easily across the lawn to the edge of the mere, where they vanished, close to the gravel path which leads out of the grounds. </span>
<span sid='39079' title='39079'>The lake there is 8 ft. deep, and you can imagine our feelings when we saw that the trail of the poor demented girl came to an end at the edge of it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39080' title='39080'>'"Of course, we had the drags at once, and set to work to recover the remains; but no trace of the body could we find. </span>
<span sid='39081' title='39081'>On the other hand, we brought to the surface an object of a most unexpected kind. </span>
<span sid='39082' title='39082'>It was a linen bag, which contained within it a mass of old rusted and discoloured metal and several dull-coloured pieces of pebble or glass. </span>
<span sid='39083' title='39083'>This strange find was all that we could get from the mere, and although we made every possible search and inquiry yesterday, we know nothing of the fate either of Rachel Howells or Richard Brunton. </span>
<span sid='39084' title='39084'>The county police are at their wits' end, and I have come up to you as a last resource."</span>
<p>
<span sid='39085' title='39085'>'You can imagine, Watson, with what eagerness I listened to this extraordinary sequence of events, and endeavoured to piece them together, and to devise some common thread upon which they might all hang.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39086' title='39086'>'The butler was gone. </span>
<span sid='39087' title='39087'>The maid was gone. </span>
<span sid='39088' title='39088'>The maid had loved the butler, but had afterwards had cause to hate him. </span>
<span sid='39089' title='39089'>She was of Welsh blood, fiery and passionate. </span>
<span sid='39090' title='39090'>She had been terribly excited immediately after his disappearance. </span>
<span sid='39091' title='39091'>She had flung into the lake a bag containing some curious contents. </span>
<span sid='39092' title='39092'>These were all factors which had to be taken into consideration, and yet none of them got quite to the heart of the matter. </span>
<span sid='39093' title='39093'>What was the starting-point of this chain of events? </span>
<span sid='39094' title='39094'>There lay the end of this tangled line.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39095' title='39095'>'"I must see that paper, Musgrave," said I, "which this butler of yours thought it worth his while to consult, even at the risk of the loss of his place."</span>
<p>
<span sid='39096' title='39096'>'"It is rather an absurd business, this Ritual of ours," he answered, "but it has at least the saving grace of antiquity to excuse it. </span>
<span sid='39097' title='39097'>I have a copy of the questions and answers here, if you care to run your eye over them."</span>
<p>
<span sid='39098' title='39098'>'He handed me the very paper which I have here, Watson, and this is the strange catechism to which each Musgrave had to submit when he came to man's estate. </span>
<span sid='39099' title='39099'>I will read you the questions and answers as they stand:</span>
<p>
<span sid='39100' title='39100'>'"Whose was it?</span>
<p>
<span sid='39101' title='39101'>'"His who is gone.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39102' title='39102'>'"Who shall have it?</span>
<p>
<span sid='39103' title='39103'>'"He who will come.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39104' title='39104'>'"What was the month?</span>
<p>
<span sid='39105' title='39105'>'"The sixth from the first.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39106' title='39106'>'"Where was the sun?</span>
<p>
<span sid='39107' title='39107'>'"Over the oak.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39108' title='39108'>'"Where was the shadow?</span>
<p>
<span sid='39109' title='39109'>'"Under the elm.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39110' title='39110'>'"How was it stepped?</span>
<p>
<span sid='39111' title='39111'>'"North by ten and by ten, east by five and by five, south by two and by two, west by one and by one, and so under.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39112' title='39112'>'"What shall we give for it?</span>
<p>
<span sid='39113' title='39113'>'"All that is ours.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39114' title='39114'>'"Why should we give it?</span>
<p>
<span sid='39115' title='39115'>"For the sake of the trust."</span>
<p>
<span sid='39116' title='39116'>"The original has no date, but is in the spelling of the middle of the seventeenth century," remarked Musgrave. </span>
<span sid='39117' title='39117'>"I am afraid, however, that it can be of little help to you in solving this mystery."</span>
<p>
<span sid='39118' title='39118'>'"At least," said I, "it gives us another mystery, and one which is even more interesting than the first. </span>
<span sid='39119' title='39119'>It may be that the solution of the one may prove to be the solution of the other. </span>
<span sid='39120' title='39120'>You will excuse me, Musgrave, if I say that your butler appears to me to have been a very clever man, and to have had a clearer insight than ten generations of his masters."</span>
<p>
<span sid='39121' title='39121'>'"I hardly follow you," said Musgrave. </span>
<span sid='39122' title='39122'>"The paper seems to me to be of no practical importance."</span>
<p>
<span sid='39123' title='39123'>'"But to me it seems immensely practical, and I fancy that Brunton took the same view. </span>
<span sid='39124' title='39124'>He had probably seen it before that night on which you caught him."</span>
<p>
<span sid='39125' title='39125'>'"It is very possible. </span>
<span sid='39126' title='39126'>We took no pains to hide it."</span>
<p>
<span sid='39127' title='39127'>'"He simply wished, I should imagine, to refresh his memory upon that last occasion. </span>
<span sid='39128' title='39128'>He had, as I understand, some sort of map or chart which he was comparing with the manuscript, and which he thrust into his pocket when you appeared?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='39129' title='39129'>'"That is true. </span>
<span sid='39130' title='39130'>But what could he have to do with this old family custom of ours, and what does this rigmarole mean?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='39131' title='39131'>'"I don't think that we should have much difficulty in determining that," said I. </span>
<span sid='39132' title='39132'>"With your permission we will take the first train down to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sussex&t=h'>Sussex</a> and go a little more deeply into the matter upon the spot."</span>
<p>
<span sid='39133' title='39133'>'The same afternoon saw us both at Hurlstone. </span>
<span sid='39134' title='39134'>Possibly you have seen pictures and read descriptions of the famous old building, so I will confine my account of it to saying that it is built in the shape of an L, the long arm being the more modern portion, and the shorter the ancient nucleus from which the other has developed. </span>
<span sid='39135' title='39135'>Over the low, heavy-lintelled door, in the centre of this old part, is chiselled the date 1607, but experts are agreed that the beams and stonework are really much older than this. </span>
<span sid='39136' title='39136'>The enormously thick walls and tiny windows of this part had in the last century driven the family into building the new wing, and the old one was used now as a storehouse and a cellar when it was used at all. </span>
<span sid='39137' title='39137'>A splendid park, with fine old timber, surrounded the house, and the lake, to which my client had referred, lay close to the avenue, about two hundred yards from the building.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39138' title='39138'>'I was already firmly convinced, Watson, that there were not three separate mysteries here, but one only, and that if I could read the Musgrave Ritual aright, I should hold in my hand the clue which would lead me to the truth concerning both the butler Brunton, and the maid Howells. </span>
<span sid='39139' title='39139'>To that, then, I turned all my energies. </span>
<span sid='39140' title='39140'>Why should this servant be so anxious to master this old formula? </span>
<span sid='39141' title='39141'>Evidently because he saw something in it which had escaped all those generations of country squires, and from which he expected some personal advantage. </span>
<span sid='39142' title='39142'>What was it, then, and how had it affected his fate?</span>
<p>
<span sid='39143' title='39143'>'It was perfectly obvious to me on reading the Ritual that the measurements must refer to some spot to which the rest of the document alluded, and that if we could find that spot we should be in a fair way towards knowing what the secret was which the old Musgraves had thought it necessary to embalm in so curious a fashion. </span>
<span sid='39144' title='39144'>There were two guides given us to start with, an oak and an elm. </span>
<span sid='39145' title='39145'>As to the oak, there could be no question at all. </span>
<span sid='39146' title='39146'>Right in front of the house, upon the left-hand side of the drive, there stood a patriarch among oaks, one of the most magnificent trees that I have ever seen.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39147' title='39147'>'"That was there when your Ritual was drawn up?" said I, as we drove past it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39148' title='39148'>'"It was there at the Norman Conquest, in all probability," he answered. </span>
<span sid='39149' title='39149'>"It has a girth of 23 ft."</span>
<p>
<span sid='39150' title='39150'>'Here was one of my fixed points secured.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39151' title='39151'>'"Have you any old elms?" I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39152' title='39152'>'"There used to be a very old one over yonder, but it was struck by lightning ten years ago, and we cut down the stump."</span>
<p>
<span sid='39153' title='39153'>'"You can see where it used to be?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='39154' title='39154'>'"Oh, yes."</span>
<p>
<span sid='39155' title='39155'>'"There are no other elms?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='39156' title='39156'>'"No old ones, but plenty of beeches."</span>
<p>
<span sid='39157' title='39157'>'"I should like to see where it grew."</span>
<p>
<span sid='39158' title='39158'>'We had driven up in a dog-cart, and my client led me away at once, without our entering the house, to the scar on the lawn where the elm had stood. </span>
<span sid='39159' title='39159'>It was nearly midway between the oak and the house. </span>
<span sid='39160' title='39160'>My investigation seemed to be progressing.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39161' title='39161'>'"I suppose it is impossible to find out how high the elm was?" I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39162' title='39162'>'"I can give you it at once. </span>
<span sid='39163' title='39163'>It was 64 ft."</span>
<p>
<span sid='39164' title='39164'>'"How do you come to know it?" I asked in surprise.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39165' title='39165'>'"When my old tutor used to give me an exercise in trigonometry it always took the shape of measuring heights. </span>
<span sid='39166' title='39166'>When I was a lad I worked out every tree and building on the estate."</span>
<p>
<span sid='39167' title='39167'>'This was an unexpected piece of luck. </span>
<span sid='39168' title='39168'>My data were coming more quickly than I could have reasonably hoped.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39169' title='39169'>'"Tell me," I asked, "did your butler ever ask you such a question?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='39170' title='39170'>'Reginald Musgrave looked at me in astonishment. </span>
<span sid='39171' title='39171'>"Now that you call it to my mind," he answered, " Brunton did ask me about the height of the tree some months ago, in connection with some little argument with the groom."</span>
<p>
<span sid='39172' title='39172'>'This was excellent news, Watson, for it showed me that I was on the right road. </span>
<span sid='39173' title='39173'>I looked up at the sun. </span>
<span sid='39174' title='39174'>It was low in the heavens, and I calculated that in less than an hour it would lie just above the topmost branches of the old oak. </span>
<span sid='39175' title='39175'>One condition mentioned in the Ritual would then be fulfilled. </span>
<span sid='39176' title='39176'>And the shadow of the elm must mean the further end of the shadow, otherwise the trunk would have been chosen as the guide. </span>
<span sid='39177' title='39177'>I had then to find where the far end of the shadow would fall when the sun was just clear of the oak.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39178' title='39178'>'That must have been difficult, Holmes, when the elm was no longer there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39179' title='39179'>'Well, at least, I knew that if Brunton could do it, I could also. </span>
<span sid='39180' title='39180'>Besides, there was no real difficulty. </span>
<span sid='39181' title='39181'>I went with Musgrave to his study and whittled myself this peg, to which I tied this long string, with a knot at each yard. </span>
<span sid='39182' title='39182'>Then I took two lengths of a fishing-rod, which came to just six feet, and I went back with my client to where the elm had been. </span>
<span sid='39183' title='39183'>The sun was just grazing the top of the oak. </span>
<span sid='39184' title='39184'>I fastened the rod on end, marked out the direction of the shadow, and measured it. </span>
<span sid='39185' title='39185'>It was 9 ft. in length.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39186' title='39186'>'Of course, the calculation was now a simple one. </span>
<span sid='39187' title='39187'>If a rod of 6 ft. threw a shadow of 9 ft., a tree of 64 ft. </span>
<span sid='39188' title='39188'>would throw one of 96 ft., and the line of one would of course be the line of the other. </span>
<span sid='39189' title='39189'>I measured out the distance, which brought me almost to the wall of the house, and I thrust a peg into the spot. </span>
<span sid='39190' title='39190'>You can imagine my exultation, Watson, when within 2 in. of my peg I saw a conical depression in the ground. </span>
<span sid='39191' title='39191'>I knew that it was the mark made by Brunton in his measurements, and that I was still upon his trail.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39192' title='39192'>'From this starting point I proceeded to step, having first taken the cardinal points by my pocket compass. </span>
<span sid='39193' title='39193'>Ten steps with each foot took me along parallel with the wall of the house, and again I marked my spot with a peg. </span>
<span sid='39194' title='39194'>Then I carefully paced off five to the east and two to the south. </span>
<span sid='39195' title='39195'>It brought me to the very threshold of the old door. </span>
<span sid='39196' title='39196'>Two steps to the west meant now that I was to go two paces down the stone-flagged passage, and this was the place indicated by the Ritual.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39197' title='39197'>'Never have I felt such a cold chill of disappointment, Watson. </span>
<span sid='39198' title='39198'>For a moment it seemed to me that there must be some radical mistake in my calculations. </span>
<span sid='39199' title='39199'>The setting sun shone full upon the passage floor, and I could see that the old foot-worn grey stones, with which it was paved, were firmly cemented together, and had certainly not been moved for many a long year. </span>
<span sid='39200' title='39200'>Brunton had not been at work here. </span>
<span sid='39201' title='39201'>I tapped upon the floor, but it sounded the same all over, and there was no sign of any crack or crevice. </span>
<span sid='39202' title='39202'>But fortunately, Musgrave, who had begun to appreciate the meaning of my proceedings, and who was now as excited as myself, took out his manuscript to check my calculations.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39203' title='39203'>'"And under," he cried: "you have omitted the 'and under'."</span>
<p>
<span sid='39204' title='39204'>'I had thought that it meant that we were to dig, but now, of course, I saw at once that I was wrong. </span>
<span sid='39205' title='39205'>"There is a cellar under this, then?" I cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39206' title='39206'>'"Yes, and as old as the house. </span>
<span sid='39207' title='39207'>Down here, through this door."</span>
<p>
<span sid='39208' title='39208'>'We went down a winding stone stair, and my companion, striking a match, lit a large lantern which stood on a barrel in the corner. </span>
<span sid='39209' title='39209'>In an instant it was obvious that we had at last come upon the true place, and that we had not been the only people to visit the spot recently.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39210' title='39210'>'It had been used for the storage of wood, but the billets, which had evidently been littered over the floor, were now piled at the sides so as to leave a clear space in the middle. </span>
<span sid='39211' title='39211'>In this space lay a large and heavy flagstone, with a rusted iron ring in the centre, to which a thick shepherd's check muffler was attached.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39212' title='39212'>'"By Jove!" cried my client, "that's Brunton's muffler. </span>
<span sid='39213' title='39213'>I have seen it on him, and could swear to it. </span>
<span sid='39214' title='39214'>What has the villain been doing here?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='39215' title='39215'>'At my suggestion a couple of the county police were summoned to be present, and I then endeavoured to raise the stone by pulling on the cravat. </span>
<span sid='39216' title='39216'>I could only move it slightly, and it was with the aid of one of the constables that I succeeded at last in carrying it to one side. </span>
<span sid='39217' title='39217'>A black hole yawned beneath, into which we all peered, while Musgrave, kneeling at the side, pushed down the lantern.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39218' title='39218'>'A small chamber about 7 ft. deep and 4 ft. square lay open to us. </span>
<span sid='39219' title='39219'>At one side of this was a squat, brass-bound, wooden box, the lid of which was hinged upwards, with this curious, old-fashioned key projecting from the lock. </span>
<span sid='39220' title='39220'>It was furred outside by a thick layer of dust, and damp and worms had eaten through the wood so that a crop of livid fungi was growing on the inside of it. </span>
<span sid='39221' title='39221'>Several discs of metal - old coins apparently - such as I hold here, were scattered over the bottom of the box, but it contained nothing else.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39222' title='39222'>'At that moment, however, we had no thought for the old chest, for our eyes were riveted upon that which crouched beside it. </span>
<span sid='39223' title='39223'>It was the figure of a man, clad in a suit of black, who squatted down upon his hams with his forehead sunk upon the edge of the box and his two arms thrown out on each side of it. </span>
<span sid='39224' title='39224'>The attitude had drawn all the stagnant blood to his face, and no man could have recognised that distorted, liver-coloured countenance; but his height, his dress, and his hair were all sufficient to show my client, when we had drawn the body up, that it was indeed his missing butler. </span>
<span sid='39225' title='39225'>He had been dead some days, but there was no wound or bruise upon his person to show how he had met his dreadful end. </span>
<span sid='39226' title='39226'>When his body had been carried from the cellar we found ourselves still confronted with a problem which was almost as formidable as that with which we had started.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39227' title='39227'>'I confess that so far, Watson, I had been disappointed in my investigation. </span>
<span sid='39228' title='39228'>I had reckoned upon solving the matter when once I had found the place referred to in the Ritual; but now I was there, and was apparently as far as ever from knowing what it was which the family had concealed with such elaborate precautions. </span>
<span sid='39229' title='39229'>It is true that I had thrown a light upon the fate of Brunton, but now I had to ascertain how that fate had come upon him, and what part had been played in the matter by the woman who had disappeared. </span>
<span sid='39230' title='39230'>I sat down upon a keg in the corner and thought the whole matter carefully over.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39231' title='39231'>'You know my methods in such cases, Watson: I put myself in the man's place, and having first gauged his intelligence, I try to imagine how I should myself have proceeded under the same circumstances. </span>
<span sid='39232' title='39232'>In this case the matter was simplified by Brunton's intelligence being quite first rate, so that it was unnecessary to make any allowance for the personal equation, as the astronomers have dubbed it. </span>
<span sid='39233' title='39233'>He knew that something valuable was concealed. </span>
<span sid='39234' title='39234'>He had spotted the place. </span>
<span sid='39235' title='39235'>He found that the stone which covered it was just too heavy for a man to move unaided. </span>
<span sid='39236' title='39236'>What would he do next? </span>
<span sid='39237' title='39237'>He could not get help from outside, even if he had someone whom he could trust, without the unbarring of doors, and considerable risk of detection. </span>
<span sid='39238' title='39238'>It was better, if he could, to have his helpmate inside the house. </span>
<span sid='39239' title='39239'>But whom could he ask? </span>
<span sid='39240' title='39240'>This girl had been devoted to him. </span>
<span sid='39241' title='39241'>A man always finds it hard to realize that he may have finally lost a woman's love, however badly he may have treated her. </span>
<span sid='39242' title='39242'>He would try by a few attentions to make his peace with the girl Howells, and then would engage her as his accomplice. </span>
<span sid='39243' title='39243'>Together they would come at night to the cellar, and their united force would suffice to raise the stone. </span>
<span sid='39244' title='39244'>So far I could follow their actions as if I had actually seen them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39245' title='39245'>'But for two of them, and one a woman, it must have been heavy work, the raising of that stone. </span>
<span sid='39246' title='39246'>A burly <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sussex&t=h'>Sussex</a> policeman and I had found it no light job. </span>
<span sid='39247' title='39247'>What would they do to assist them? </span>
<span sid='39248' title='39248'>Probably what I should have done myself. </span>
<span sid='39249' title='39249'>I rose and examined carefully the different billets of wood which were scattered round the floor. </span>
<span sid='39250' title='39250'>Almost at once I came upon what I expected. </span>
<span sid='39251' title='39251'>One piece, about 3 ft. in length, had a marked indentation at one end, while several were flattened at the sides as if they had been compressed by some considerable weight. </span>
<span sid='39252' title='39252'>Evidently, as they had dragged the stone up they had thrust the chunks of wood into the chink, until at last, when the opening was large enough to crawl through, they would hold it open by a billet placed lengthwise, which might very well become indented at the lower end, since the whole weight of the stone would press it down on to the edge of the other slab. </span>
<span sid='39253' title='39253'>So far I was still on safe ground.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39254' title='39254'>'And now, how was I to proceed to reconstruct this midnight drama? </span>
<span sid='39255' title='39255'>Clearly only one could get into the hole, and that one was Brunton. </span>
<span sid='39256' title='39256'>The girl must have waited above. </span>
<span sid='39257' title='39257'>Brunton then unlocked the box, handed up the contents, presumably - since they were not to be found - and then-and then what happened?</span>
<p>
<span sid='39258' title='39258'>'What smouldering fire of vengeance had suddenly sprung into flame in this passionate Celtic woman's soul when she saw the man who had wronged her - wronged her, perhaps, far more than we suspected - in her power? </span>
<span sid='39259' title='39259'>Was it a chance that the wood had slipped and that the stone had shut Brunton into what had become his sepulchre? </span>
<span sid='39260' title='39260'>Had she only been guilty of silence as to his fate? </span>
<span sid='39261' title='39261'>Or had some sudden blow from her hand dashed the support away and sent the slab crashing down into its place. </span>
<span sid='39262' title='39262'>Be that as it might, I seemed to see that woman's figure, still clutching at her treasure-trove, and flying wildly up the winding stair with her ears ringing perhaps with the muffled screams from behind her, and with the drumming of frenzied hands against the slab of stone which was choking her faithless lover's life out.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39263' title='39263'>'Here was the secret of her blanched face, her shaken nerves, her peals of hysterical laughter on the next morning. </span>
<span sid='39264' title='39264'>But what had been in the box? </span>
<span sid='39265' title='39265'>What had she done with that? </span>
<span sid='39266' title='39266'>Of course, it must have been the old metal and pebbles which my client had dragged from the mere. </span>
<span sid='39267' title='39267'>She had thrown them in there at the first opportunity, to remove the last trace of her crime.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39268' title='39268'>'For twenty minutes I had sat motionless thinking the matter out. </span>
<span sid='39269' title='39269'>Musgrave still stood with a very pale face swinging his lantern and peering down into the hole.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39270' title='39270'>'"These are coins of Charles I," said he, holding out the few which had been left in the box. </span>
<span sid='39271' title='39271'>"You see we were right in fixing our date for the Ritual."</span>
<p>
<span sid='39272' title='39272'>'"We may find something else of Charles I," I cried, as the probable meaning of the first two questions of the Ritual broke suddenly upon me. </span>
<span sid='39273' title='39273'>"Let me see the contents of the bag you fished from the mere."</span>
<p>
<span sid='39274' title='39274'>'We ascended to his study, and he laid the débris before me. </span>
<span sid='39275' title='39275'>I could understand his regarding it as of small importance when I looked at it, for the metal was almost black, and the stones lustreless and dull. </span>
<span sid='39276' title='39276'>I rubbed one of them on my sleeve, however, and it glowed afterwards like a spark, in the dark hollow of my hand. </span>
<span sid='39277' title='39277'>The metal-work was in the form of a double-ring, but it had been bent and twisted out of its original shape.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39278' title='39278'>'"You must bear in mind," said I, "that the Royal party made head in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> even after the death of the King, and that when they at last fled they probably left many of their most precious possessions buried behind them, with the intention of returning for them in more peaceful times."</span>
<p>
<span sid='39279' title='39279'>'"My ancestor, Sir Ralph Musgrave, was a prominent Cavalier, and the right-hand man of Charles II in his wanderings," said my friend.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39280' title='39280'>'"Ah, indeed!" I answered. </span>
<span sid='39281' title='39281'>"Well, now, I think that really should give us the last link that we wanted. </span>
<span sid='39282' title='39282'>I must congratulate you on coming into possession, though in rather a tragic manner, of a relic which is of great intrinsic value, but even of greater importance as an historical curiosity."</span>
<p>
<span sid='39283' title='39283'>'"What is it, then?" he gasped in astonishment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39284' title='39284'>'"It is nothing less than the ancient crown of the Kings of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>."</span>
<p>
<span sid='39285' title='39285'>'"The crown!"</span>
<p>
<span sid='39286' title='39286'>'"Precisely. </span>
<span sid='39287' title='39287'>Consider what the Ritual says. </span>
<span sid='39288' title='39288'>How does it run? </span>
<span sid='39289' title='39289'>'Whose was it?' </span>
<span sid='39290' title='39290'>'His who is gone.' </span>
<span sid='39291' title='39291'>That was after the execution of Charles. </span>
<span sid='39292' title='39292'>Then, 'Who shall have it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39293' title='39293'>'He who will come.' </span>
<span sid='39294' title='39294'>That was Charles II, whose advent was already foreseen. </span>
<span sid='39295' title='39295'>There can, I think, be no doubt that this battered and shapeless diadem once encircled the brows of the Royal Stuarts."</span>
<p>
<span sid='39296' title='39296'>'"And how came it in the pond?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='39297' title='39297'>'"Ah, that is a question which will take some time to answer," and with that I sketched out the whole long chain of surmise and of proof which I had constructed. </span>
<span sid='39298' title='39298'>The twilight had closed in and the moon was shining brightly in the sky before my narrative was finished.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39299' title='39299'>'"And how was it, then, that Charles did not get his crown when he returned?" asked Musgrave, pushing back the relic into its linen bag.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39300' title='39300'>'"Ah, there you lay your finger upon the one point which we shall probably never be able to clear up. </span>
<span sid='39301' title='39301'>It is likely that the Musgrave who held the secret died in the interval, and by some oversight left this guide to his descendant without explaining the meaning of it. </span>
<span sid='39302' title='39302'>From that day to this it has been handed down from father to son, until at last it came within reach of a man who tore its secret out of it and lost his life in the venture."</span>
<p>
<span sid='39303' title='39303'>'And that's the story of the Musgrave Ritual, Watson. </span>
<span sid='39304' title='39304'>They have the crown down at Hurlstone - though they had some legal bother, and a considerable sum to pay before they were allowed to retain it. </span>
<span sid='39305' title='39305'>I am sure that if you mentioned my name they would be happy to show it to you. </span>
<span sid='39306' title='39306'>Of the woman nothing was ever heard, and the probability is that she got away out of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, and carried herself, and the memory of her crime, to some land beyond the seas.'</span>
