<p>
<span sid='38243' title='38243'>We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid brought in a telegram. </span>
<span sid='38244' title='38244'>It was from Sherlock Holmes, and ran in this way:</span>
<p>
<span sid='38245' title='38245'>'Have you a couple of days to spare? </span>
<span sid='38246' title='38246'>Have just been wired for from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the West&t=h'>the West</a> of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. </span>
<span sid='38247' title='38247'>Shall be glad if you will come with me. </span>
<span sid='38248' title='38248'>Air and scenery perfect. </span>
<span sid='38249' title='38249'>Leave Paddington by the 11.15.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38250' title='38250'>'What do you say, dear?' said my wife, looking across at me. </span>
<span sid='38251' title='38251'>'Will you go?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38252' title='38252'>'I really don't know what to say. </span>
<span sid='38253' title='38253'>I have a fairly long list at present.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38254' title='38254'>'Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. </span>
<span sid='38255' title='38255'>You have been looking a little pale lately. </span>
<span sid='38256' title='38256'>I think that the change would do you good, and you are always so interested in Mr Sherlock Holmes's cases.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38257' title='38257'>'I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one of them,' I answered. </span>
<span sid='38258' title='38258'>'But if I am to go I must pack at once, for I have only half an hour.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38259' title='38259'>My experience of camp life in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Afghanistan&t=h'>Afghanistan</a> had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. </span>
<span sid='38260' title='38260'>My wants were few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my valise, rattling away to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Paddington Station&t=h'>Paddington Station</a>. </span>
<span sid='38261' title='38261'>Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38262' title='38262'>'It is really very good of you to come, Watson,' said he. </span>
<span sid='38263' title='38263'>'It makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely. </span>
<span sid='38264' title='38264'>Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed. </span>
<span sid='38265' title='38265'>If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38266' title='38266'>We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which Holmes had brought with him. </span>
<span sid='38267' title='38267'>Among these he rummaged and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Reading&t=h'>Reading</a>. </span>
<span sid='38268' title='38268'>Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball, and tossed them up on to the rack.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38269' title='38269'>'Have you heard anything of the case?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38270' title='38270'>'Not a word. </span>
<span sid='38271' title='38271'>I have not seen a paper for some days.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38272' title='38272'>'The <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> press has not had very full accounts. </span>
<span sid='38273' title='38273'>I have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars. </span>
<span sid='38274' title='38274'>It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38275' title='38275'>'That sounds a little paradoxical.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38276' title='38276'>'But it is profoundly true. </span>
<span sid='38277' title='38277'>Singularity is almost invariably a clue. </span>
<span sid='38278' title='38278'>The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home. </span>
<span sid='38279' title='38279'>In this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38280' title='38280'>'It is a murder, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38281' title='38281'>'Well, it is conjectured to be so. </span>
<span sid='38282' title='38282'>I shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. </span>
<span sid='38283' title='38283'>I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few words.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38284' title='38284'>'Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a>, in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Hereford&t=h'>Hereford</a>shire. </span>
<span sid='38285' title='38285'>The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr John Turner, who made his money in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Australia&t=h'>Australia</a>, and returned some years ago to the old country. </span>
<span sid='38286' title='38286'>One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Australia&t=h'>Australia</a>n. </span>
<span sid='38287' title='38287'>The men had known each other in the Colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible. </span>
<span sid='38288' title='38288'>Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant, but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were frequently together. </span>
<span sid='38289' title='38289'>McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living. </span>
<span sid='38290' title='38290'>They appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring English families, and to have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of sport, and were frequently seen at the race meetings of the neighbourhood. </span>
<span sid='38291' title='38291'>McCarthy kept two servants - a man and a girl. </span>
<span sid='38292' title='38292'>Turner had a considerable household, some half dozen at the least. </span>
<span sid='38293' title='38293'>That is as much as I have been able to gather about the families. </span>
<span sid='38294' title='38294'>Now for the facts.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38295' title='38295'>'On June 3 - that is, on Monday last - McCarthy left his house at Hatherley about three in the afternoon, and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. </span>
<span sid='38296' title='38296'>He had been out with his serving-man in the morning at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a>, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three. </span>
<span sid='38297' title='38297'>From that appointment he never came back alive.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38298' title='38298'>'From Hatherley Farm-house to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. </span>
<span sid='38299' title='38299'>One was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder, a gamekeeper in the employ of Mr Turner. </span>
<span sid='38300' title='38300'>Both these witnesses depose that Mr McCarthy was walking alone. </span>
<span sid='38301' title='38301'>The gamekeeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr James McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. </span>
<span sid='38302' title='38302'>To the best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was following him. </span>
<span sid='38303' title='38303'>He thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38304' title='38304'>'The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the gamekeeper, lost sight of them. </span>
<span sid='38305' title='38305'>The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. </span>
<span sid='38306' title='38306'>A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley Estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. </span>
<span sid='38307' title='38307'>She states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. </span>
<span sid='38308' title='38308'>She heard Mr McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. </span>
<span sid='38309' title='38309'>She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away, and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to fight. </span>
<span sid='38310' title='38310'>She had hardly said the words when young Mr McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. </span>
<span sid='38311' title='38311'>He was much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. </span>
<span sid='38312' title='38312'>On following him they found the dead body of his father stretched out upon the grass beside the Pool. </span>
<span sid='38313' title='38313'>The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. </span>
<span sid='38314' title='38314'>The injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son's gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. </span>
<span sid='38315' title='38315'>Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of "Wilful Murder" having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a>, who have referred the case to the next Assizes. </span>
<span sid='38316' title='38316'>Those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and at the police-court.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38317' title='38317'>'I could hardly imagine a more damning case,' I remarked. </span>
<span sid='38318' title='38318'>'If ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38319' title='38319'>'Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,' answered Holmes, thoughtfully; 'it may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. </span>
<span sid='38320' title='38320'>It must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit. </span>
<span sid='38321' title='38321'>There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may remember in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in his interest. </span>
<span sid='38322' title='38322'>Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour, instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38323' title='38323'>'I am afraid,' said I, 'that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38324' title='38324'>'There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,' he answered, laughing. </span>
<span sid='38325' title='38325'>'Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to Mr Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='38326' title='38326'>You know me too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of understanding. </span>
<span sid='38327' title='38327'>To take the first example to hand, I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38328' title='38328'>'How on earth-!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38329' title='38329'>'My dear fellow, I know you well. </span>
<span sid='38330' title='38330'>I know the military neatness which characterizes you. </span>
<span sid='38331' title='38331'>You shave every morning, and in this season you shave by the sunlight, but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get further back on the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that side is less well illuminated than the other. </span>
<span sid='38332' title='38332'>I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light, and being satisfied with such a result. </span>
<span sid='38333' title='38333'>I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference. </span>
<span sid='38334' title='38334'>Therein lies my mÃ©tier, and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us. </span>
<span sid='38335' title='38335'>There are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38336' title='38336'>'What are they?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38337' title='38337'>'It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the return to Hatherley Farm. </span>
<span sid='38338' title='38338'>On the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. </span>
<span sid='38339' title='38339'>This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which , might have remained in the minds of the coroner's jury.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38340' title='38340'>'It was a confession,' I ejaculated.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38341' title='38341'>'No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38342' title='38342'>'Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a most suspicious remark.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38343' title='38343'>'On the contrary,' said Holmes, 'it is the brightest rift which I can at present see in the clouds. </span>
<span sid='38344' title='38344'>However innocent he might be, he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him. </span>
<span sid='38345' title='38345'>Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. </span>
<span sid='38346' title='38346'>His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness. </span>
<span sid='38347' title='38347'>As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood by the dead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. </span>
<span sid='38348' title='38348'>The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind, rather than of a guilty one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38349' title='38349'>I shook my head. </span>
<span sid='38350' title='38350'>'Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,' I remarked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38351' title='38351'>'So they have. </span>
<span sid='38352' title='38352'>And many men have been wrongfully hanged.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38353' title='38353'>'What is the young man's own account of the matter?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38354' title='38354'>'It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. </span>
<span sid='38355' title='38355'>You will find it here, and may read it for yourself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38356' title='38356'>He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Hereford&t=h'>Hereford</a>shire paper, and having turned down the sheet, he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred. </span>
<span sid='38357' title='38357'>I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage, and read it very, carefully. </span>
<span sid='38358' title='38358'>It ran in this way:</span>
<p>
<span sid='38359' title='38359'>'Mr James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called, and gave evidence as follows: "I had been away from home for three days at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bristol&t=h'>Bristol</a>, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the 3rd. </span>
<span sid='38360' title='38360'>My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a> with John Cobb, the groom. </span>
<span sid='38361' title='38361'>Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was going. </span>
<span sid='38362' title='38362'>I then took my gun, and strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side. </span>
<span sid='38363' title='38363'>On my way I saw William Crowder, the gamekeeper, as he has stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. </span>
<span sid='38364' title='38364'>I had no idea that he was in front of me. </span>
<span sid='38365' title='38365'>When about a hundred yards from the Pool I heard a cry of 'Cooee!' </span>
<span sid='38366' title='38366'>which was a usual signal between my father and myself. </span>
<span sid='38367' title='38367'>I then hurried forward, and found him standing by the Pool. </span>
<span sid='38368' title='38368'>He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me, and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. </span>
<span sid='38369' title='38369'>A conversation ensued, which led to high words, and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. </span>
<span sid='38370' title='38370'>Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him, and returned towards Hatherley Farm. </span>
<span sid='38371' title='38371'>I had not gone more than one hundred and fifty yards, however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. </span>
<span sid='38372' title='38372'>I found my father expiring on the ground, with his head terribly injured. </span>
<span sid='38373' title='38373'>I dropped my gun, and held him in my arms, but he almost instantly expired. </span>
<span sid='38374' title='38374'>I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my way to Mr Turner's lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. </span>
<span sid='38375' title='38375'>I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by his injuries. </span>
<span sid='38376' title='38376'>He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners; but he had, as far as I know, no active enemies. </span>
<span sid='38377' title='38377'>I know nothing further of the matter."</span>
<p>
<span sid='38378' title='38378'>'The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?</span>
<p>
<span sid='38379' title='38379'>'Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to a rat.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38380' title='38380'>'The Coroner: What did you understand by that?</span>
<p>
<span sid='38381' title='38381'>'Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. </span>
<span sid='38382' title='38382'>I thought that he was delirious.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38383' title='38383'>'The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel?</span>
<p>
<span sid='38384' title='38384'>'Witness: I should prefer not to answer.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38385' title='38385'>'The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38386' title='38386'>'Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. </span>
<span sid='38387' title='38387'>I can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38388' title='38388'>'The Coroner: That is for the Court to decide. </span>
<span sid='38389' title='38389'>I need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38390' title='38390'>'Witness: I must still refuse.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38391' title='38391'>'The Coroner: I understand that the cry of "Cooee" was a common signal between you and your father?</span>
<p>
<span sid='38392' title='38392'>'Witness: It was.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38393' title='38393'>'The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and before he even knew that you had returned from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bristol&t=h'>Bristol</a>?</span>
<p>
<span sid='38394' title='38394'>'Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38395' title='38395'>'A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry, and found your father fatally injured?</span>
<p>
<span sid='38396' title='38396'>'Witness: Nothing definite.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38397' title='38397'>'The Coroner: What do you mean?</span>
<p>
<span sid='38398' title='38398'>'Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open, that I could think of nothing except my father. </span>
<span sid='38399' title='38399'>Yet I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me. </span>
<span sid='38400' title='38400'>It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps. </span>
<span sid='38401' title='38401'>When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was gone.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38402' title='38402'>'Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?</span>
<p>
<span sid='38403' title='38403'>'Yes, it was gone.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38404' title='38404'>'You cannot say what it was?</span>
<p>
<span sid='38405' title='38405'>'No, I had a feeling something was there.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38406' title='38406'>'How far from the body?</span>
<p>
<span sid='38407' title='38407'>'A dozen yards or so.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38408' title='38408'>'And how far from the edge of the wood?</span>
<p>
<span sid='38409' title='38409'>'About the same.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38410' title='38410'>'Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?</span>
<p>
<span sid='38411' title='38411'>'Yes, but with my back towards it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38412' title='38412'>'This concluded the examination of the witness.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38413' title='38413'>'I see,' said I, as I glanced down the column, 'that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. </span>
<span sid='38414' title='38414'>He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his father's dying words. </span>
<span sid='38415' title='38415'>They are all, as he remarks, very much against the son.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38416' title='38416'>Holmes laughed softly to himself, and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat. </span>
<span sid='38417' title='38417'>'Both you and the coroner have been at some pains,' said he, 'to single out the very strongest points in the young man's favour. </span>
<span sid='38418' title='38418'>Don't you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little? </span>
<span sid='38419' title='38419'>Too little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outrÃ© as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. </span>
<span sid='38420' title='38420'>No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. </span>
<span sid='38421' title='38421'>And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of action. </span>
<span sid='38422' title='38422'>We lunch at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Swindon&t=h'>Swindon</a>, and I see that we shall be there in twenty minutes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38423' title='38423'>It was nearly four o'clock when we at last, after passing through the beautiful <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Stroud Valley&t=h'>Stroud Valley</a> and over the broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at the pretty little country town of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a>. </span>
<span sid='38424' title='38424'>A lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. </span>
<span sid='38425' title='38425'>In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognizing Lestrade, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>. </span>
<span sid='38426' title='38426'>With him we drove to the '<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Hereford&t=h'>Hereford</a> Arms', where a room had already been engaged for us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38427' title='38427'>'I have ordered a carriage,' said Lestrade, as we sat over a cup of tea. </span>
<span sid='38428' title='38428'>'I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38429' title='38429'>'It was very nice and complimentary of you,' Holmes answered. </span>
<span sid='38430' title='38430'>'It is entirely a question of barometric pressure.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38431' title='38431'>Lestrade looked startled. </span>
<span sid='38432' title='38432'>'I do not quite follow,' he said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38433' title='38433'>'How is the glass? </span>
<span sid='38434' title='38434'>Twenty-nine, I see. </span>
<span sid='38435' title='38435'>No wind, and not a cloud in the sky. </span>
<span sid='38436' title='38436'>I have a easeful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. </span>
<span sid='38437' title='38437'>I do not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38438' title='38438'>Lestrade laughed indulgently. </span>
<span sid='38439' title='38439'>'You have, no doubt, already formed your conclusions from the newspapers,' he said. </span>
<span sid='38440' title='38440'>'The case is as plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. </span>
<span sid='38441' title='38441'>Still, of course, one can't refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too. </span>
<span sid='38442' title='38442'>She had heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done. </span>
<span sid='38443' title='38443'>Why, bless my soul! </span>
<span sid='38444' title='38444'>here is her carriage at the door.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38445' title='38445'>He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. </span>
<span sid='38446' title='38446'>Her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38447' title='38447'>'Oh, Mr Sherlock Holmes!' she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a woman's quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, 'I am so glad that you have come. </span>
<span sid='38448' title='38448'>I have driven down to tell you so. </span>
<span sid='38449' title='38449'>I know that James didn't do it. </span>
<span sid='38450' title='38450'>I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it, too. </span>
<span sid='38451' title='38451'>Never let yourself doubt upon that point. </span>
<span sid='38452' title='38452'>We have known each other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. </span>
<span sid='38453' title='38453'>Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38454' title='38454'>'I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,' said Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='38455' title='38455'>'You may rely upon my doing all that I can.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38456' title='38456'>'But you have read the evidence. </span>
<span sid='38457' title='38457'>You have formed some conclusion? </span>
<span sid='38458' title='38458'>Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? </span>
<span sid='38459' title='38459'>Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38460' title='38460'>'I think that it is very probable.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38461' title='38461'>'There now!' she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly at Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='38462' title='38462'>'You hear! </span>
<span sid='38463' title='38463'>He gives me hope.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38464' title='38464'>Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. </span>
<span sid='38465' title='38465'>'I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions,' he said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38466' title='38466'>'But he is right. </span>
<span sid='38467' title='38467'>Oh! </span>
<span sid='38468' title='38468'>I know that he is right. </span>
<span sid='38469' title='38469'>James never did it. </span>
<span sid='38470' title='38470'>And about his quarrel with his father. </span>
<span sid='38471' title='38471'>I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38472' title='38472'>'In what way?' asked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38473' title='38473'>'It is no time for me to hide anything. </span>
<span sid='38474' title='38474'>James and his father had many disagreements about me. </span>
<span sid='38475' title='38475'>Mr McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us. </span>
<span sid='38476' title='38476'>James and I have always loved each other as brother and sister, but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet, and - and - well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. </span>
<span sid='38477' title='38477'>So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38478' title='38478'>'And your father?' asked Holmes. </span>
<span sid='38479' title='38479'>'Was he in favour of such a union?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38480' title='38480'>'No, he was averse to it also. </span>
<span sid='38481' title='38481'>No one but Mr McCarthy was in favour of it.' </span>
<span sid='38482' title='38482'>A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38483' title='38483'>'Thank you for this information,' said he. </span>
<span sid='38484' title='38484'>'May I see your father if I call to-morrow?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38485' title='38485'>'I am afraid the doctor won't allow it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38486' title='38486'>'The doctor?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38487' title='38487'>'Yes, have you not heard? </span>
<span sid='38488' title='38488'>Poor father has never been strong for years back, but this has broken him down completely. </span>
<span sid='38489' title='38489'>He has taken to his bed, and Dr Willows says that he is a wreck, and that his nervous system is shattered. </span>
<span sid='38490' title='38490'>Mr McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Victoria&t=h'>Victoria</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38491' title='38491'>'Ha! </span>
<span sid='38492' title='38492'>In <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Victoria&t=h'>Victoria</a>! </span>
<span sid='38493' title='38493'>That is important.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38494' title='38494'>'Yes, at the mines.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38495' title='38495'>'Quite so; at the gold mines, where, as I understand, Mr Turner made his money.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38496' title='38496'>'Yes, certainly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38497' title='38497'>'Thank you, Miss Turner. </span>
<span sid='38498' title='38498'>You have been of material assistance to me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38499' title='38499'>'You will tell me if you have any news tomorrow. </span>
<span sid='38500' title='38500'>No doubt you will go to the prison to see James. </span>
<span sid='38501' title='38501'>Oh, if you do, Mr Holmes, do tell him that I know him to be innocent.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38502' title='38502'>'I will, Miss Turner.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38503' title='38503'>'I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave him. </span>
<span sid='38504' title='38504'>Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.' </span>
<span sid='38505' title='38505'>She hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38506' title='38506'>'I am ashamed of you, Holmes,' said Lestrade with dignity, after a few minutes' silence. </span>
<span sid='38507' title='38507'>'Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint? </span>
<span sid='38508' title='38508'>I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38509' title='38509'>'I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='38510' title='38510'>'Have you an order to see him in prison?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38511' title='38511'>'Yes, but only for you and me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38512' title='38512'>'Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. </span>
<span sid='38513' title='38513'>We have still time to take a train, to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Hereford&t=h'>Hereford</a> and see him to-night?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38514' title='38514'>'Ample.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38515' title='38515'>'Then let us do so. </span>
<span sid='38516' title='38516'>Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38517' title='38517'>I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. </span>
<span sid='38518' title='38518'>The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention wander so constantly from the fiction to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room, and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day. </span>
<span sid='38519' title='38519'>Supposing that this unhappy young man's story was absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity, could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father and the moment when, drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? </span>
<span sid='38520' title='38520'>It was something terrible and deadly. </span>
<span sid='38521' title='38521'>What could it be? </span>
<span sid='38522' title='38522'>Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts? </span>
<span sid='38523' title='38523'>I rang the bell, and called for the weekly country paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest. </span>
<span sid='38524' title='38524'>In the surgeon's deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. </span>
<span sid='38525' title='38525'>I marked the spot upon my own head. </span>
<span sid='38526' title='38526'>Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind. </span>
<span sid='38527' title='38527'>That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. </span>
<span sid='38528' title='38528'>Still, it did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell. </span>
<span sid='38529' title='38529'>Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes's attention to it. </span>
<span sid='38530' title='38530'>Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. </span>
<span sid='38531' title='38531'>What could that mean? </span>
<span sid='38532' title='38532'>It could not be delirium. </span>
<span sid='38533' title='38533'>A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. </span>
<span sid='38534' title='38534'>No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. </span>
<span sid='38535' title='38535'>But what could it indicate? </span>
<span sid='38536' title='38536'>I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. </span>
<span sid='38537' title='38537'>And then the incident of the grey cloth, seen by young McCarthy. </span>
<span sid='38538' title='38538'>If that were true, the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. </span>
<span sid='38539' title='38539'>What a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! </span>
<span sid='38540' title='38540'>I did not wonder at Lestrade's opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes's insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy's innocence.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38541' title='38541'>It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. </span>
<span sid='38542' title='38542'>He came back alone, for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38543' title='38543'>'The glass still keeps very high,' he remarked, as he sat down. </span>
<span sid='38544' title='38544'>'It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground. </span>
<span sid='38545' title='38545'>On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. </span>
<span sid='38546' title='38546'>I have seen young McCarthy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38547' title='38547'>'And what did you learn from him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38548' title='38548'>'Nothing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38549' title='38549'>'Could lie throw no light?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38550' title='38550'>'None at all. </span>
<span sid='38551' title='38551'>I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it, and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. </span>
<span sid='38552' title='38552'>He is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at, and, I should think, sound at heart.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38553' title='38553'>'I cannot admire his taste,' I remarked, 'if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss Turner.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38554' title='38554'>'Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. </span>
<span sid='38555' title='38555'>This fellow is madly, insanely in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bristol&t=h'>Bristol</a>, and marry her at a registry office! </span>
<span sid='38556' title='38556'>No one knows a word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. </span>
<span sid='38557' title='38557'>It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss Turner. </span>
<span sid='38558' title='38558'>On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. </span>
<span sid='38559' title='38559'>It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bristol&t=h'>Bristol</a>, and his father did not know where he was. </span>
<span sid='38560' title='38560'>Mark that point. </span>
<span sid='38561' title='38561'>It is of importance. </span>
<span sid='38562' title='38562'>Good has come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble, and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly, and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bermuda&t=h'>Bermuda</a> Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. </span>
<span sid='38563' title='38563'>I think that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all that he has suffered.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38564' title='38564'>'But if he is innocent, who has done it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38565' title='38565'>'Ah! who? </span>
<span sid='38566' title='38566'>I would call your attention very particularly to two points. </span>
<span sid='38567' title='38567'>One is that the murdered man had an appointment with some one at the Pool, and that the some one could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would return. </span>
<span sid='38568' title='38568'>The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry "Cooee!" before he knew that his son had returned. </span>
<span sid='38569' title='38569'>Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. </span>
<span sid='38570' title='38570'>And now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave minor points until tomorrow.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38571' title='38571'>There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. </span>
<span sid='38572' title='38572'>At nine o'clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38573' title='38573'>'There is serious news this morning,' Lestrade observed. </span>
<span sid='38574' title='38574'>'It is said that Mr Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38575' title='38575'>'An elderly man, I presume?' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38576' title='38576'>'About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. </span>
<span sid='38577' title='38577'>This business has had a very bad effect upon him. </span>
<span sid='38578' title='38578'>He was an old friend of McCarthy's, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38579' title='38579'>'Indeed! </span>
<span sid='38580' title='38580'>That is interesting,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38581' title='38581'>'Oh, yes! </span>
<span sid='38582' title='38582'>In a hundred other ways he has helped him. </span>
<span sid='38583' title='38583'>Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38584' title='38584'>'Really! </span>
<span sid='38585' title='38585'>Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son to Turner's daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it was merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow? </span>
<span sid='38586' title='38586'>It is the more strange since we know that Turner himself was averse to the idea. </span>
<span sid='38587' title='38587'>The daughter told us as much. </span>
<span sid='38588' title='38588'>Do you not deduce something from that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38589' title='38589'>'We have got to the deductions and the inferences,' said Lestrade, winking at me. </span>
<span sid='38590' title='38590'>'I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38591' title='38591'>'You are right,' said Holmes demurely; 'you do find it very hard to tackle the facts.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38592' title='38592'>'Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of,' replied Lestrade with some warmth.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38593' title='38593'>'And that is?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38594' title='38594'>'That McCarthy, senior, met his death from McCarthy, junior, and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38595' title='38595'>'Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,' said Holmes, laughing. </span>
<span sid='38596' title='38596'>'But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38597' title='38597'>'Yes, that is it.' </span>
<span sid='38598' title='38598'>It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls. </span>
<span sid='38599' title='38599'>The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it. </span>
<span sid='38600' title='38600'>We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes's request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the son's, though not the pair which he had then had. </span>
<span sid='38601' title='38601'>Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes desired to be led to the courtyard, from which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38602' title='38602'>Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this. </span>
<span sid='38603' title='38603'>Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> would have failed to recognize him. </span>
<span sid='38604' title='38604'>His face flushed and darkened. </span>
<span sid='38605' title='38605'>His brows were drawn into two hard, black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. </span>
<span sid='38606' title='38606'>His face was bent downwards, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. </span>
<span sid='38607' title='38607'>His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him, that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply. </span>
<span sid='38608' title='38608'>Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool. </span>
<span sid='38609' title='38609'>It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. </span>
<span sid='38610' title='38610'>Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow. </span>
<span sid='38611' title='38611'>Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38612' title='38612'>The Boscombe Pool, which is a reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr Turner. </span>
<span sid='38613' title='38613'>Above the woods which lined it upon the further side we could see the red jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner's dwelling. </span>
<span sid='38614' title='38614'>On the Hatherley side of the Pool, the woods grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. </span>
<span sid='38615' title='38615'>Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found, and indeed, so moist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man. </span>
<span sid='38616' title='38616'>To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass. </span>
<span sid='38617' title='38617'>He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38618' title='38618'>'What did you go into the Pool for?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38619' title='38619'>'I fished about with a rake. </span>
<span sid='38620' title='38620'>I thought there might be some weapon or other trace. </span>
<span sid='38621' title='38621'>But how on earth?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38622' title='38622'>'Oh, tut, tut! </span>
<span sid='38623' title='38623'>I have no time. </span>
<span sid='38624' title='38624'>That left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place. </span>
<span sid='38625' title='38625'>A mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among the reeds. </span>
<span sid='38626' title='38626'>Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo, and wallowed all over it. </span>
<span sid='38627' title='38627'>Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. </span>
<span sid='38628' title='38628'>But here are three separate tracks of the same feet.' </span>
<span sid='38629' title='38629'>He drew out a lens, and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. </span>
<span sid='38630' title='38630'>'These are young McCarthy's feet. </span>
<span sid='38631' title='38631'>Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly so that the soles are deeply marked, and the heels hardly visible. </span>
<span sid='38632' title='38632'>That bears out his story. </span>
<span sid='38633' title='38633'>He ran when he saw his father on the ground. </span>
<span sid='38634' title='38634'>Then here are the father's feet as he paced up and down. </span>
<span sid='38635' title='38635'>What is this, then? </span>
<span sid='38636' title='38636'>It is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. </span>
<span sid='38637' title='38637'>And this? </span>
<span sid='38638' title='38638'>Ha, ha! </span>
<span sid='38639' title='38639'>What have we here? </span>
<span sid='38640' title='38640'>Tip-toes, tip-toes! </span>
<span sid='38641' title='38641'>Square, too, quite unusual boots! </span>
<span sid='38642' title='38642'>They come, they go, they come again - of course that was for the cloak. </span>
<span sid='38643' title='38643'>Now where did they come from?' </span>
<span sid='38644' title='38644'>He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track, until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. </span>
<span sid='38645' title='38645'>Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this, and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction. </span>
<span sid='38646' title='38646'>For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope, and examining with his lens not only the ground, but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach. </span>
<span sid='38647' title='38647'>A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. </span>
<span sid='38648' title='38648'>Then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the high-road, where all traces were lost.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38649' title='38649'>'It has been a case of considerable interest,' he remarked, returning to his natural manner. </span>
<span sid='38650' title='38650'>'I fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge. </span>
<span sid='38651' title='38651'>I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. </span>
<span sid='38652' title='38652'>Having done that, we may drive back to our luncheon. </span>
<span sid='38653' title='38653'>You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38654' title='38654'>It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab, and drove back into <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a>, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38655' title='38655'>'This may interest you, Lestrade,' he remarked, holding it out. </span>
<span sid='38656' title='38656'>'The murder was done with it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38657' title='38657'>'I see no marks.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38658' title='38658'>'There are none.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38659' title='38659'>'How do you know, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38660' title='38660'>'The grass was growing under it. </span>
<span sid='38661' title='38661'>It had only lain there a few days. </span>
<span sid='38662' title='38662'>There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. </span>
<span sid='38663' title='38663'>It corresponds with the injuries. </span>
<span sid='38664' title='38664'>There is no sign of any other weapon.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38665' title='38665'>'And the murderer?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38666' title='38666'>'Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt penknife in his pocket. </span>
<span sid='38667' title='38667'>There are several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38668' title='38668'>Lestrade laughed. </span>
<span sid='38669' title='38669'>'I am afraid that I am still a sceptic,' he said. </span>
<span sid='38670' title='38670'>'Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed British jury.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38671' title='38671'>'Nous verrons,' answered Holmes calmly. </span>
<span sid='38672' title='38672'>'You work your own method, and I shall work mine. </span>
<span sid='38673' title='38673'>I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall probably return to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> by the evening train.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38674' title='38674'>'And leave your case unfinished?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38675' title='38675'>'No, finished.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38676' title='38676'>'But the mystery?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38677' title='38677'>'It is solved.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38678' title='38678'>'Who was the criminal, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38679' title='38679'>'The gentleman I describe.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38680' title='38680'>'But who is he?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38681' title='38681'>'Surely it would not be difficult to find out. </span>
<span sid='38682' title='38682'>This is not such a populous neighbourhood.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38683' title='38683'>Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. </span>
<span sid='38684' title='38684'>'I am a practical man,' he said, 'and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. </span>
<span sid='38685' title='38685'>I should become the laughing-stock of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38686' title='38686'>'All right,' said Holmes quietly. </span>
<span sid='38687' title='38687'>'I have given you the chance. </span>
<span sid='38688' title='38688'>Here are your lodgings. </span>
<span sid='38689' title='38689'>Good-bye. </span>
<span sid='38690' title='38690'>I shall drop you a line before I leave.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38691' title='38691'>Having left Lestrade at his rooms we drove to our hotel, where we found lunch upon the table. </span>
<span sid='38692' title='38692'>Holmes was silent and buried in thought, with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38693' title='38693'>'Look here, Watson,' he said, when the cloth was cleared; just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. </span>
<span sid='38694' title='38694'>I don't quite know what to do, and I should value your advice. </span>
<span sid='38695' title='38695'>Light a cigar, and let me expound.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38696' title='38696'>'Pray do so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38697' title='38697'>'Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young McCarthy's narrative which struck us both instantly, although they impressed me in his favour and you against him. </span>
<span sid='38698' title='38698'>One was the fact that his father should, according to his account, cry "Cooee!" before seeing him. </span>
<span sid='38699' title='38699'>The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. </span>
<span sid='38700' title='38700'>He mumbled several words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son's ear. </span>
<span sid='38701' title='38701'>Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38702' title='38702'>'What of this "Cooee!" then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38703' title='38703'>'Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. </span>
<span sid='38704' title='38704'>The son, as far as he knew, was in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bristol&t=h'>Bristol</a>. </span>
<span sid='38705' title='38705'>It was mere chance that he was within earshot. </span>
<span sid='38706' title='38706'>The "Cooee!" was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. </span>
<span sid='38707' title='38707'>But "Cooee" is a distinctly <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Australia&t=h'>Australia</a>n cry, and one which is used between <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Australia&t=h'>Australia</a>ns. </span>
<span sid='38708' title='38708'>There is a strong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet at Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Australia&t=h'>Australia</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38709' title='38709'>'What of the rat, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38710' title='38710'>Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table. </span>
<span sid='38711' title='38711'>'This is a map of the Colony of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Victoria&t=h'>Victoria</a>,' he said. </span>
<span sid='38712' title='38712'>'I wired to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bristol&t=h'>Bristol</a> for it last night.' </span>
<span sid='38713' title='38713'>He put his hand over part of the map. </span>
<span sid='38714' title='38714'>'What do you read?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38715' title='38715'>'ARAT,' I read.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38716' title='38716'>'And now?' he raised his hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38717' title='38717'>'BALLARAT.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38718' title='38718'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='38719' title='38719'>That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only caught the last two syllables. </span>
<span sid='38720' title='38720'>He was trying to utter the name of his murderer. </span>
<span sid='38721' title='38721'>So-and-so of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ballarat&t=h'>Ballarat</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38722' title='38722'>'It is wonderful!' I exclaimed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38723' title='38723'>'It is obvious. </span>
<span sid='38724' title='38724'>And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down considerably. </span>
<span sid='38725' title='38725'>The possession of a grey garment was a third point which, granting the son's statement to be correct, was a certainty. </span>
<span sid='38726' title='38726'>We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Australia&t=h'>Australia</a>n from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ballarat&t=h'>Ballarat</a> with a grey cloak.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38727' title='38727'>'Certainly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38728' title='38728'>'And one who was at home in the district, for the Pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly wander.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38729' title='38729'>'Quite so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38730' title='38730'>'Then comes our expedition of to-day. </span>
<span sid='38731' title='38731'>By an examination of the ground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38732' title='38732'>'But how did you gain them?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38733' title='38733'>'You know my method. </span>
<span sid='38734' title='38734'>It is founded upon the observance of trifles.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38735' title='38735'>'His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride. </span>
<span sid='38736' title='38736'>His boots, too, might be told from their traces.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38737' title='38737'>'Yes, they were peculiar boots.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38738' title='38738'>'But his lameness?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38739' title='38739'>'The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left. </span>
<span sid='38740' title='38740'>He put less weight upon it. </span>
<span sid='38741' title='38741'>Why? </span>
<span sid='38742' title='38742'>Because he limped - he was lame.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38743' title='38743'>'But his left-handedness?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38744' title='38744'>'You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest. </span>
<span sid='38745' title='38745'>The blow was struck from immediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. </span>
<span sid='38746' title='38746'>Now, how can that be unless it were by a left-handed man? </span>
<span sid='38747' title='38747'>He had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son. </span>
<span sid='38748' title='38748'>He had even smoked there. </span>
<span sid='38749' title='38749'>I found the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enabled me to pronounce as an Indian cigar. </span>
<span sid='38750' title='38750'>I have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. </span>
<span sid='38751' title='38751'>Having found the ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it. </span>
<span sid='38752' title='38752'>It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which are rolled in Rotterdam.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38753' title='38753'>And the cigar-holder?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38754' title='38754'>'I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. </span>
<span sid='38755' title='38755'>Therefore he used a holder. </span>
<span sid='38756' title='38756'>The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt penknife.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38757' title='38757'>'Holmes,' I said, 'you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him. </span>
<span sid='38758' title='38758'>I see the direction in which all this points. </span>
<span sid='38759' title='38759'>The culprit is-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38760' title='38760'>'Mr John Turner,' cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38761' title='38761'>The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. </span>
<span sid='38762' title='38762'>His slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character. </span>
<span sid='38763' title='38763'>His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. </span>
<span sid='38764' title='38764'>It was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38765' title='38765'>'Pray sit down on the sofa,' said Holmes gently. </span>
<span sid='38766' title='38766'>'You had my note?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38767' title='38767'>'Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. </span>
<span sid='38768' title='38768'>You said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38769' title='38769'>'I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38770' title='38770'>'And why did you wish to see me?' </span>
<span sid='38771' title='38771'>He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question were already answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38772' title='38772'>'Yes,' said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. </span>
<span sid='38773' title='38773'>'It is so. </span>
<span sid='38774' title='38774'>I know all about McCarthy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38775' title='38775'>The old man sank his face in his hands. </span>
<span sid='38776' title='38776'>'God help me!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='38777' title='38777'>'But I would not have let the young man come to harm. </span>
<span sid='38778' title='38778'>I give you my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38779' title='38779'>'I am glad to hear you say so,' said Holmes, gravely.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38780' title='38780'>'I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. </span>
<span sid='38781' title='38781'>It would break her heart - it will break her heart when she hears that I am arrested.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38782' title='38782'>'It may not come to that,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38783' title='38783'>'What!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38784' title='38784'>'I am no official agent. </span>
<span sid='38785' title='38785'>I understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests. </span>
<span sid='38786' title='38786'>Young McCarthy must be got off, however.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38787' title='38787'>'I am a dying man,' said old Turner. </span>
<span sid='38788' title='38788'>'I have had diabetes for years. </span>
<span sid='38789' title='38789'>My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. </span>
<span sid='38790' title='38790'>Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38791' title='38791'>Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him. </span>
<span sid='38792' title='38792'>Just tell us the truth,' he said. </span>
<span sid='38793' title='38793'>'I shall jot down the facts. </span>
<span sid='38794' title='38794'>You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it. </span>
<span sid='38795' title='38795'>Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy. </span>
<span sid='38796' title='38796'>I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38797' title='38797'>'It's as well,' said the old man; 'it's a question whether I shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare Alice the shock. </span>
<span sid='38798' title='38798'>And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38799' title='38799'>'You didn't know this dead man, McCarthy. </span>
<span sid='38800' title='38800'>He was a devil incarnate. </span>
<span sid='38801' title='38801'>I tell you that. </span>
<span sid='38802' title='38802'>God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he. </span>
<span sid='38803' title='38803'>His grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life. </span>
<span sid='38804' title='38804'>I'll tell you first how I came to be in his power.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38805' title='38805'>'It was in the early 'sixties at the diggings. </span>
<span sid='38806' title='38806'>I was a young chap then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand to anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to the bush, and, in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber. </span>
<span sid='38807' title='38807'>There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings. </span>
<span sid='38808' title='38808'>Black Jack of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ballarat&t=h'>Ballarat</a> was the name I went under, and our party is still remembered in the colony as the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ballarat&t=h'>Ballarat</a> Gang.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38809' title='38809'>'One day a gold convoy came down from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ballarat&t=h'>Ballarat</a> to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Melbourne&t=h'>Melbourne</a>, and we lay in wait for it and attacked it. </span>
<span sid='38810' title='38810'>There were six troopers and six of us, so it was a dose thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley. </span>
<span sid='38811' title='38811'>Three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag. </span>
<span sid='38812' title='38812'>I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. </span>
<span sid='38813' title='38813'>I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature. </span>
<span sid='38814' title='38814'>We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made our way over to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> without being suspected. </span>
<span sid='38815' title='38815'>There I parted from my old pals, and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life. </span>
<span sid='38816' title='38816'>I bought this estate, which chanced to be in the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to make up for the way in which I had earned it. </span>
<span sid='38817' title='38817'>I married, too, and though my wife died young, she left me my dear little Alice. </span>
<span sid='38818' title='38818'>Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done. </span>
<span sid='38819' title='38819'>In a word, I turned over a new leaf, and did my best to make up for the past. </span>
<span sid='38820' title='38820'>Ali was going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38821' title='38821'>'I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Regent Street&t=h'>Regent Street</a> with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38822' title='38822'>'"Here we are, Jack," says he, touching me on the arm; "we'll be as good as a family to you. </span>
<span sid='38823' title='38823'>There's two of us, me and my son, and you can have the keeping of us. </span>
<span sid='38824' title='38824'>If you don't - it's a fine, law-abiding country is <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, and there's always a policeman within hail."</span>
<p>
<span sid='38825' title='38825'>'Well', down they came to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the West&t=h'>the West</a> Country, there was no shaking them off', and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since. </span>
<span sid='38826' title='38826'>There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. </span>
<span sid='38827' title='38827'>It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. </span>
<span sid='38828' title='38828'>Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked for a thing which I could not give. </span>
<span sid='38829' title='38829'>He asked for Alice.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38830' title='38830'>'His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property. </span>
<span sid='38831' title='38831'>But there I was firm. </span>
<span sid='38832' title='38832'>I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. </span>
<span sid='38833' title='38833'>I stood firm. </span>
<span sid='38834' title='38834'>McCarthy threatened. </span>
<span sid='38835' title='38835'>I braved him to do his worst. </span>
<span sid='38836' title='38836'>We were to meet at the Pool midway between our houses to talk it over.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38837' title='38837'>'When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a cigar, and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. </span>
<span sid='38838' title='38838'>But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost. </span>
<span sid='38839' title='38839'>He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets. </span>
<span sid='38840' title='38840'>It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this. </span>
<span sid='38841' title='38841'>Could I not snap the bond? </span>
<span sid='38842' title='38842'>I was already a dying and a desperate man. </span>
<span sid='38843' title='38843'>Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. </span>
<span sid='38844' title='38844'>But my memory and my girl! </span>
<span sid='38845' title='38845'>Both could be saved, if I could but silence that foul tongue. </span>
<span sid='38846' title='38846'>I did it, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='38847' title='38847'>I would do it again. </span>
<span sid='38848' title='38848'>Deeply as I have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. </span>
<span sid='38849' title='38849'>But that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than I could suffer. </span>
<span sid='38850' title='38850'>I struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast. </span>
<span sid='38851' title='38851'>His cry brought back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. </span>
<span sid='38852' title='38852'>That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that occurred.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38853' title='38853'>'Well, it is not for me to judge you,' said Holmes, as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out. </span>
<span sid='38854' title='38854'>'I pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38855' title='38855'>'I pray not, sir. </span>
<span sid='38856' title='38856'>And what do you intend to do?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38857' title='38857'>'In view of your health, nothing. </span>
<span sid='38858' title='38858'>You are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes. </span>
<span sid='38859' title='38859'>I will keep your confession, and, if McCarthy is condemned, I shall be forced to use it. </span>
<span sid='38860' title='38860'>If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38861' title='38861'>'Farewell! then,' said the old man solemnly. </span>
<span sid='38862' title='38862'>'Your own death-beds, when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine.' </span>
<span sid='38863' title='38863'>Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='38864' title='38864'>'God help us!' said Holmes, after a long silence. </span>
<span sid='38865' title='38865'>'Why does Fate play such tricks with poor helpless worms? </span>
<span sid='38866' title='38866'>I never hear of such a case as this that I do not think of Baxter's words, and say: "There, but for the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes."'</span>
<p>
<span sid='38867' title='38867'>James McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes, on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes, and submitted to the defending counsel. </span>
<span sid='38868' title='38868'>Old Turner lived for seven months after our interviews, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together, in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past.</span>
