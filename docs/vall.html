<span sid='21261' title='21261'>PART 1 : The Tragedy of Birlstone</span>
<p>
<span sid='21262' title='21262'>CHAPTER 1 : The Warning</span>
<p>
<span sid='21263' title='21263'>'I am inclined to think-' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21264' title='21264'>'I should do so,' Sherlock Holmes remarked, impatiently.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21265' title='21265'>I believe that I am one of the most long-suffering of mortals, but I admit that I was annoyed at the sardonic interruption.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21266' title='21266'>'Really, Holmes,' said I, severely, 'you are a little trying at times.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21267' title='21267'>He was too much absorbed with his own thoughts to give any immediate answer to my remonstrance. </span>
<span sid='21268' title='21268'>He leaned upon his hand, with his untasted breakfast before him, and he stared at the slip of paper which he had just drawn from its envelope. </span>
<span sid='21269' title='21269'>Then he took the envelope itself, held it up to the light, and very carefully studied both the exterior and the flap.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21270' title='21270'>'It is Porlock's writing,' said he, thoughtfully. </span>
<span sid='21271' title='21271'>'I can hardly doubt that it is Porlock's writing, though I have only seen it twice before. </span>
<span sid='21272' title='21272'>The Greek "e" with the peculiar top flourish is distinctive. </span>
<span sid='21273' title='21273'>But if it is from Porlock, then it must be something of the very first importance.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21274' title='21274'>He was speaking to himself rather than to me, but my vexation disappeared in the interest which the words awakened.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21275' title='21275'>'Who, then, is Porlock?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21276' title='21276'>'Porlock, Watson, is a nom de plume, a mere identification mark, but behind it lies a shifty and evasive personality. </span>
<span sid='21277' title='21277'>In a former letter he frankly informed me that the name was not his own, and defied me ever to trace him among the teeming millions of this great city. </span>
<span sid='21278' title='21278'>Porlock is important, not for himself, but for the great man with whom he is in touch. </span>
<span sid='21279' title='21279'>Picture to yourself the pilot-fish with the shark, the jackal with the lion - anything that is insignificant in companionship with what is formidable. </span>
<span sid='21280' title='21280'>Not only formidable, Watson, but sinister - in the highest degree sinister. </span>
<span sid='21281' title='21281'>That is where he comes within my purview. </span>
<span sid='21282' title='21282'>You have heard me speak of Professor Moriarty?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21283' title='21283'>'The famous scientific criminal, as famous among crooks as-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21284' title='21284'>'My blushes, Watson,' Holmes murmured, in a deprecating voice.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21285' title='21285'>'I was about to say "as he is unknown to the public":</span>
<p>
<span sid='21286' title='21286'>'A touch - a distinct touch!' cried Holmes. </span>
<span sid='21287' title='21287'>'You are developing a certain unexpected vein of pawky humour, Watson, against which I must learn to guard myself. </span>
<span sid='21288' title='21288'>But in calling Moriarty a criminal you are uttering libel in the eyes of the law, and there lies the glory and the wonder of it. </span>
<span sid='21289' title='21289'>The greatest schemer of all time, the organizer of every devilry, the controlling brain of the underworld - a brain which might have made or marred the destiny of nations. </span>
<span sid='21290' title='21290'>That's the man. </span>
<span sid='21291' title='21291'>But so aloof is he from general suspicion -  so immune from criticism - so admirable in his management and self-effacement, that for those very words that you have uttered he could hale you to a court and emerge with your year's pension as a solatium for his wounded character. </span>
<span sid='21292' title='21292'>Is he not the celebrated author of The Dynamics of an Asteroid - a book which ascends to such rarefied heights of pure mathematics that it is said that there was no man in the scientific press capable of criticizing it? </span>
<span sid='21293' title='21293'>Is this a man to traduce? </span>
<span sid='21294' title='21294'>Foul-mouthed doctor and slandered professor -  such would be your respective roles. </span>
<span sid='21295' title='21295'>That's genius, Watson. </span>
<span sid='21296' title='21296'>But if I am spared by lesser men our day will surely come.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21297' title='21297'>'May I be there to seer I exclaimed, devoutly. </span>
<span sid='21298' title='21298'>'But you were speaking of this man Porlock.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21299' title='21299'>'Ah, yes - the so-called Porlock is a link in the chain some little way from its great attachment. </span>
<span sid='21300' title='21300'>Porlock is not quite a sound link, between ourselves. </span>
<span sid='21301' title='21301'>He is the only flaw in that chain so far as I have been able to test it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21302' title='21302'>'But no chain is stronger than its weakest link.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21303' title='21303'>'Exactly, my dear Watson. </span>
<span sid='21304' title='21304'>Hence the extreme importance of Porlock. </span>
<span sid='21305' title='21305'>Led on by some rudimentary aspirations towards right, and encouraged by the judicious stimulation of an occasional ten-pound note sent to him by devious methods, he has once or twice given me advance information which has been of value - that highest value which anticipates and prevents rather than avenges crime. </span>
<span sid='21306' title='21306'>I cannot doubt that if we had the cipher we should find that this communication is of the nature that I indicate.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21307' title='21307'>Again Holmes flattened out the paper upon his unused plate. </span>
<span sid='21308' title='21308'>I rose and, leaning over him, stared down at the curious inscription, which ran as follows:</span>
<p>
<span sid='21309' title='21309'>534 C2 13 127 36 31 4 17 21 41</span>
<p>
<span sid='21310' title='21310'>DOUGLAS 109 293 5 37 BIRLSTONE</span>
<p>
<span sid='21311' title='21311'>26 BIRLSTONE 9 127 171</span>
<p>
<span sid='21312' title='21312'>'What do you make of it, Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21313' title='21313'>'It is obviously an attempt to convey secret information.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21314' title='21314'>'But what is the use of a cipher message without the cipher?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21315' title='21315'>'In this instance, none at all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21316' title='21316'>'Why do you say "in this instance"?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21317' title='21317'>'Because there are many ciphers which I would read as easily as I do the apocrypha of the agony column. </span>
<span sid='21318' title='21318'>Such crude devices amuse the intelligence without fatiguing it. </span>
<span sid='21319' title='21319'>But this is different. </span>
<span sid='21320' title='21320'>It is clearly a reference to the words in a page of some book. </span>
<span sid='21321' title='21321'>Until I am told which page and which book I am powerless.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21322' title='21322'>'But why "Douglas" and "Birlstone"?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21323' title='21323'>'Clearly because those are words which were not contained in the page in question.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21324' title='21324'>'Then why has he not indicated the book?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21325' title='21325'>'Your native shrewdness, my dear Watson, that innate cunning which is the delight of your friends, would surely prevent you from enclosing cipher and message in the same envelope. </span>
<span sid='21326' title='21326'>Should it miscarry you are undone. </span>
<span sid='21327' title='21327'>As it is, both have to go wrong before any harm comes from it. </span>
<span sid='21328' title='21328'>Our second post is now overdue, and I shall be surprised if it does not bring us either a further letter of explanation or, as is more probable, the very volume to which these figures refer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21329' title='21329'>Holmes's calculation was fulfilled within a very few minutes by the appearance of Billy, the page, with the very letter which we were expecting.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21330' title='21330'>'The same writing,' remarked Holmes, as he opened the envelope, 'and actually signed,' he added, in an exultant voice, as he unfolded the epistle. </span>
<span sid='21331' title='21331'>'Come, we are getting on, Watson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21332' title='21332'>His brow clouded, however, as he glanced over the contents.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21333' title='21333'>'Dear me, this is very disappointing! </span>
<span sid='21334' title='21334'>I fear, Watson, that all our expectations come to nothing. </span>
<span sid='21335' title='21335'>I trust that the man Porlock will come to no harm.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21336' title='21336'>'"Dear Mr Holmes," he says, "I will go no further in this matter. </span>
<span sid='21337' title='21337'>It is too dangerous. </span>
<span sid='21338' title='21338'>He suspects me. </span>
<span sid='21339' title='21339'>I can see that he suspects me. </span>
<span sid='21340' title='21340'>He came to me quite unexpectedly after I had actually addressed this envelope with the intention of sending you the key to the cipher. </span>
<span sid='21341' title='21341'>I was able to cover it up. </span>
<span sid='21342' title='21342'>If he had seen it, it would have gone hard with me. </span>
<span sid='21343' title='21343'>But I read suspicion in his eyes. </span>
<span sid='21344' title='21344'>Please burn the cipher message, which can now be of no use to you. </span>
<span sid='21345' title='21345'>- Fred Porlock."'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21346' title='21346'>Holmes sat for some little time twisting this letter between his fingers, and frowning, as he stared into the fire.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21347' title='21347'>'After all,' he said at last, 'there may be nothing in it. </span>
<span sid='21348' title='21348'>It may be only his guilty conscience. </span>
<span sid='21349' title='21349'>Knowing himself to be a traitor, he may have read the accusation in the other's eyes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21350' title='21350'>'The other being, I presume, Professor Moriarty?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21351' title='21351'>'No less. </span>
<span sid='21352' title='21352'>When any of that party talk about "he", you know whom they mean. </span>
<span sid='21353' title='21353'>There is one predominant "he" for all of them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21354' title='21354'>'But what can he do?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21355' title='21355'>'Hum! </span>
<span sid='21356' title='21356'>That's a large question. </span>
<span sid='21357' title='21357'>When you have one of the first brains of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a> up against you and all the powers of darkness at his back, there are infinite possibilities. </span>
<span sid='21358' title='21358'>Anyhow, friend Porlock is evidently scared out of his senses. </span>
<span sid='21359' title='21359'>Kindly compare the writing in the note with that upon its envelope, which was done, he tells us, before this ill-omened visit. </span>
<span sid='21360' title='21360'>The one is clear and firm; the other hardly legible.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21361' title='21361'>'Why did he write at all? </span>
<span sid='21362' title='21362'>Why did he not simply drop it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21363' title='21363'>'Because he feared I would make some inquiry after him in that case, and possibly bring trouble on him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21364' title='21364'>'No doubt,' said I. </span>
<span sid='21365' title='21365'>'Of course' - I had picked up the original cipher message and was bending my brows over it - 'it's pretty maddening to think that an important secret may lie here on this slip of paper, and that it is beyond human power to penetrate it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21366' title='21366'>Sherlock Holmes had pushed away his untasted breakfast and lit the unsavoury pipe which was the companion of his deepest meditations.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21367' title='21367'>'I wonder!' said he, leaning back and staring at the ceiling. </span>
<span sid='21368' title='21368'>'Perhaps there are points which have escaped your Machiavellian intellect. </span>
<span sid='21369' title='21369'>Let us consider the problem in the light of pure reason. </span>
<span sid='21370' title='21370'>This man's reference is to a book. </span>
<span sid='21371' title='21371'>That is our point of departure.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21372' title='21372'>'A somewhat vague one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21373' title='21373'>'Let us see, then, if we can narrow it down. </span>
<span sid='21374' title='21374'>As I focus my mind upon it, it seems rather less impenetrable. </span>
<span sid='21375' title='21375'>What indications have we as to this book?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21376' title='21376'>'None.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21377' title='21377'>'Well, well, it is surely not quite so bad as that. </span>
<span sid='21378' title='21378'>The cipher message begins with a large 534, does it not? </span>
<span sid='21379' title='21379'>We may take it as a working hypothesis that 534 is the particular page to which the cipher refers. </span>
<span sid='21380' title='21380'>So our book has already become a large book, which is surely something gained. </span>
<span sid='21381' title='21381'>What other indications have we as to the nature of this large book? </span>
<span sid='21382' title='21382'>The next sign is C2. </span>
<span sid='21383' title='21383'>What do you make of that, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21384' title='21384'>'Chapter the second, no doubt.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21385' title='21385'>'Hardly that, Watson. </span>
<span sid='21386' title='21386'>You will, I am sure, agree with me that if the page be given, the number of the chapter is immaterial. </span>
<span sid='21387' title='21387'>Also that if page 534 only finds us in the second chapter, the length of the first one must have been really intolerable.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21388' title='21388'>'Column!' I cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21389' title='21389'>'Brilliant, Watson. </span>
<span sid='21390' title='21390'>You are scintillating this morning. </span>
<span sid='21391' title='21391'>If it is not column, then I am very much deceived. </span>
<span sid='21392' title='21392'>So now, you see, we begin to visualize a large book, printed in double columns, which are each of a considerable length, since one of the words is numbered in the document as the two hundred and ninety-third. </span>
<span sid='21393' title='21393'>Have we reached the limits of what reason can supply?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21394' title='21394'>'I fear that we have.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21395' title='21395'>'Surely you do yourself an injustice. </span>
<span sid='21396' title='21396'>One more coruscation, my dear Watson. </span>
<span sid='21397' title='21397'>Yet another brain-wave. </span>
<span sid='21398' title='21398'>Had the volume been an unusual one he would have sent it to me. </span>
<span sid='21399' title='21399'>Instead of that he had intended, before his plans were nipped, to send me the clue in this envelope. </span>
<span sid='21400' title='21400'>He says so in his note. </span>
<span sid='21401' title='21401'>This would seem to indicate that the book is one which he thought that I would have no difficulty in finding for myself. </span>
<span sid='21402' title='21402'>He had it, and he imagined that I would have it too. </span>
<span sid='21403' title='21403'>In short, Watson, it is a very common book.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21404' title='21404'>'What you say certainly sounds plausible.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21405' title='21405'>'So we have contracted our field of search to a large book, printed in double columns and in common use.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21406' title='21406'>'The Bible!' I cried, triumphantly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21407' title='21407'>'Good, Watson, good! </span>
<span sid='21408' title='21408'>But not, if I may say so, quite good enough. </span>
<span sid='21409' title='21409'>Even if I accepted the compliment for myself, I could hardly name any volume which would be less likely to lie at the elbow of one of Moriarty's associates. </span>
<span sid='21410' title='21410'>Besides, the editions of Holy Writ are so numerous that he could hardly suppose that two copies would have the same pagination. </span>
<span sid='21411' title='21411'>This is clearly a book which is standardized. </span>
<span sid='21412' title='21412'>He knows for certain that his page 534 will exactly agree with my page 534:</span>
<p>
<span sid='21413' title='21413'>'But very few books would correspond with that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21414' title='21414'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='21415' title='21415'>Therein lies our salvation. </span>
<span sid='21416' title='21416'>Our search is narrowed down to standardized books which any one may be supposed to possess.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21417' title='21417'>'Bradshaw!</span>
<p>
<span sid='21418' title='21418'>'There are difficulties, Watson. </span>
<span sid='21419' title='21419'>The vocabulary of Bradshaw is nervous and terse, but limited. </span>
<span sid='21420' title='21420'>The selection of words would hardly lend itself to the sending of general messages. </span>
<span sid='21421' title='21421'>We will eliminate Bradshaw. </span>
<span sid='21422' title='21422'>The dictionary is, I fear, inadmissible for the same reason. </span>
<span sid='21423' title='21423'>What, then, is left?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21424' title='21424'>'An almanack.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21425' title='21425'>'Excellent, Watson! </span>
<span sid='21426' title='21426'>I am very much mistaken if you have not touched the spot. </span>
<span sid='21427' title='21427'>An almanack! </span>
<span sid='21428' title='21428'>Let us consider the claims of Whitaker's Almanack. </span>
<span sid='21429' title='21429'>It is in common use. </span>
<span sid='21430' title='21430'>It has the requisite number of pages. </span>
<span sid='21431' title='21431'>It is in double columns. </span>
<span sid='21432' title='21432'>Though reserved in its earlier vocabulary, it becomes, if I remember right, quite garrulous towards the end.' </span>
<span sid='21433' title='21433'>He picked up the volume from his desk. </span>
<span sid='21434' title='21434'>'Here is page 534, column two, a substantial block of print dealing, I perceive, with the trade and resources of British India. </span>
<span sid='21435' title='21435'>Jot down the words, Watson. </span>
<span sid='21436' title='21436'>Number thirteen is "<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Mahratta&t=h'>Mahratta</a>". </span>
<span sid='21437' title='21437'>Not, I fear, a very auspicious beginning. </span>
<span sid='21438' title='21438'>Number one hundred and twenty-seven is "Government", which at least makes sense, though somewhat irrelevant to ourselves and Professor Moriarty. </span>
<span sid='21439' title='21439'>Now let us try again. </span>
<span sid='21440' title='21440'>What does the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Mahratta&t=h'>Mahratta</a> Government do? </span>
<span sid='21441' title='21441'>Alas! the next word is "pigs'-bristles". </span>
<span sid='21442' title='21442'>We are undone, my good Watson! </span>
<span sid='21443' title='21443'>It is finished.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21444' title='21444'>He had spoken in jesting vein, but the twitching of his bushy eyebrows bespoke his disappointment and irritation. </span>
<span sid='21445' title='21445'>I sat helpless and unhappy, staring into the fire. </span>
<span sid='21446' title='21446'>A long silence was broken by a sudden exclamation from Holmes, who dashed at a cupboard, from which he emerged with a second yellow-covered volume in his hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21447' title='21447'>'We pay the price, Watson, for being too up-to-date,' he cried. </span>
<span sid='21448' title='21448'>'We are before our time, and suffer the usual penalties. </span>
<span sid='21449' title='21449'>Being the seventh of January, we have very properly laid in the new almanack. </span>
<span sid='21450' title='21450'>It is more than likely that Porlock took his message from the old one. </span>
<span sid='21451' title='21451'>No doubt he would have told us so had his letter of explanation been written. </span>
<span sid='21452' title='21452'>Now let us see what page 534 has in store for us. </span>
<span sid='21453' title='21453'>Number thirteen is "There", which is much more promising. </span>
<span sid='21454' title='21454'>Number one hundred and twenty-seven is "is" - "There is" ' - Holmes's eyes were gleaming with excitement, and his thin, nervous fingers twitched as he counted the words - ' "danger". </span>
<span sid='21455' title='21455'>Ha! ha! </span>
<span sid='21456' title='21456'>Capital! </span>
<span sid='21457' title='21457'>Put that down, Watson. </span>
<span sid='21458' title='21458'>"There is danger may - come - very - soon - one". </span>
<span sid='21459' title='21459'>Then we have the name "Douglas" - "rich - country - now - at - Birlstone - House - Birlstone - confidence - is - pressing". </span>
<span sid='21460' title='21460'>There, Watson! </span>
<span sid='21461' title='21461'>what do you think of pure reason and its fruits? </span>
<span sid='21462' title='21462'>If the greengrocer had such a thing as a laurel-wreath I should send Billy round for it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21463' title='21463'>I was staring at the strange message which I had scrawled, as he deciphered it, upon a sheet of foolscap on my knee.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21464' title='21464'>'What a queer, scrambling way of expressing his meaning!' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21465' title='21465'>'On the contrary, he has done quite remarkably well,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='21466' title='21466'>'When you search a single column for words with which to express your meaning, you can hardly expect to get everything you want. </span>
<span sid='21467' title='21467'>You are bound to leave something to the intelligence of your correspondent. </span>
<span sid='21468' title='21468'>The purport is perfectly clear. </span>
<span sid='21469' title='21469'>Some devilry is intended against one Douglas, whoever he may be, residing as stated, a rich country gentleman. </span>
<span sid='21470' title='21470'>He is sure - "confidence" was as near as he could get to "confident" - that it is pressing. </span>
<span sid='21471' title='21471'>There is our result, and a very workmanlike little bit of analysis it was.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21472' title='21472'>Holmes had the impersonal joy of the true artist in his better work, even as he mourned darkly when it fell below the high level to which he aspired. </span>
<span sid='21473' title='21473'>He was still chuckling over his success when Billy swung open the door and Inspector MacDonald of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a> was ushered into the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21474' title='21474'>Those were the early days at the end of the 'eighties, when Alec MacDonald was far from having attained the national fame which he has now achieved. </span>
<span sid='21475' title='21475'>He was a young but trusted member of the detective force, who had distinguished himself in several cases which had been entrusted to him. </span>
<span sid='21476' title='21476'>His tall, bony figure gave promise of exceptional physical strength, while his great cranium and deep-set, lustrous eyes spoke no less clearly of the keen intelligence which twinkled out from behind his bushy eyebrows. </span>
<span sid='21477' title='21477'>He was a silent, precise man, with a dour nature and a hard Aberdonian accent. </span>
<span sid='21478' title='21478'>Twice already in his career had Holmes helped him to attain success, his own sole reward being the intellectual joy of the problem. </span>
<span sid='21479' title='21479'>For this reason the affection and respect of the Scotchman for his amateur colleague were profound, and he showed them by the frankness with which he consulted Holmes in every difficulty. </span>
<span sid='21480' title='21480'>Mediocrity knows nothing higher than itself, but talent instantly recognizes genius, and MacDonald had talent enough for his profession to enable him to perceive that there was no humiliation in seeking the assistance of one who already stood alone in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>, both in his gifts and in his experience. </span>
<span sid='21481' title='21481'>Holmes was not prone to friendship, but he was tolerant of the big Scotchman, and smiled at the sight of him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21482' title='21482'>'You are an early bird, Mr Mac,' said he. </span>
<span sid='21483' title='21483'>'I wish you luck with your worm. </span>
<span sid='21484' title='21484'>I fear this means that there is some mischief afoot.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21485' title='21485'>'If you said "hope" instead of "fear" it would be nearer the truth, I'm thinking, Mr Holmes,' the inspector answered, with a knowing grin. </span>
<span sid='21486' title='21486'>'Well, maybe a wee nip would keep out the raw morning chill. </span>
<span sid='21487' title='21487'>No, I won't smoke, I thank you. </span>
<span sid='21488' title='21488'>I'll have to be pushing on my way, for the early hours of a case are the precious ones, as no man knows better than your own self. </span>
<span sid='21489' title='21489'>But - but-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21490' title='21490'>The inspector had stopped suddenly, and was staring with a look of absolute amazement at a paper upon the table. </span>
<span sid='21491' title='21491'>It was the sheet upon which I had scrawled the enigmatic message.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21492' title='21492'>'Douglas!' he stammered. </span>
<span sid='21493' title='21493'>'Birlstone! </span>
<span sid='21494' title='21494'>What's this, Mr Holmes? </span>
<span sid='21495' title='21495'>Man, it's witchcraft! </span>
<span sid='21496' title='21496'>Where in the name of all that is wonderful did you get those names?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21497' title='21497'>'It is a cipher that Dr Watson and I have had occasion to solve. </span>
<span sid='21498' title='21498'>But why - what's amiss with the names?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21499' title='21499'>The inspector looked from one to the other of us in dazed astonishment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21500' title='21500'>'Just this,' said he, 'that Mr Douglas, of Birlstone Manor House, was horribly murdered this morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21501' title='21501'>CHAPTER 2 : Mr Sherlock Holmes Discourses</span>
<p>
<span sid='21502' title='21502'>It was one of those dramatic moments for which my friend existed. </span>
<span sid='21503' title='21503'>It would be an over-statement to say that he was shocked or even excited by the amazing announcement. </span>
<span sid='21504' title='21504'>Without having a tinge of cruelty in his singular composition, he was undoubtedly callous from long over-stimulation. </span>
<span sid='21505' title='21505'>Yet, if his emotions were dulled, his intellectual perceptions were exceedingly active. </span>
<span sid='21506' title='21506'>There was no trace then of the horror which I had myself felt at this curt declaration, but his face showed rather the quiet and interested composure of the chemist who sees the crystals falling into position from his over-saturated solution.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21507' title='21507'>'Remarkable!' said he; 'remarkable!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21508' title='21508'>'You don't seem surprised.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21509' title='21509'>'Interested, Mr Mac, but hardly surprised. </span>
<span sid='21510' title='21510'>Why should I be surprised? </span>
<span sid='21511' title='21511'>I receive an anonymous communication from a quarter which I know to be important, warning me that danger threatens a certain person. </span>
<span sid='21512' title='21512'>Within an hour I learn that this danger has actually materialized, and that the person is dead. </span>
<span sid='21513' title='21513'>I am interested, but, as you observe, I am not surprised.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21514' title='21514'>In a few short sentences he explained to the inspector the facts about the letter and the cipher. </span>
<span sid='21515' title='21515'>MacDonald sat with his chin on his hands, and his great sandy eyebrows bunched into a yellow tangle.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21516' title='21516'>'I was going down to Birlstone this morning,' said he. </span>
<span sid='21517' title='21517'>'I had come to ask you if you cared to come with me - you and your friend here. </span>
<span sid='21518' title='21518'>But from what you say we might perhaps be doing better work in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21519' title='21519'>'I rather think not,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21520' title='21520'>'Hang it all, Mr Holmes!' cried the inspector. </span>
<span sid='21521' title='21521'>'The papers will be full of the Birlstone Mystery in a day or two, but where's the mystery if there is a man in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> who prophesied the crime before ever it occurred? </span>
<span sid='21522' title='21522'>We have only to lay our hands on that man and the rest will follow.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21523' title='21523'>'No doubt, Mr Mac. </span>
<span sid='21524' title='21524'>But how did you propose to lay your hands on the so-called Porlock?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21525' title='21525'>MacDonald turned over the letter which Holmes had handed him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21526' title='21526'>'Posted in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Camberwell&t=h'>Camberwell</a> - that doesn't help us much. </span>
<span sid='21527' title='21527'>Name, you say, is assumed. </span>
<span sid='21528' title='21528'>Not much to go on, certainly. </span>
<span sid='21529' title='21529'>Didn't you say that you have sent him money?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21530' title='21530'>'Twice.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21531' title='21531'>'And how?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21532' title='21532'>'In notes to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Camberwell&t=h'>Camberwell</a> post-office.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21533' title='21533'>'Did you never trouble to see who called for them?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21534' title='21534'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21535' title='21535'>The inspector looked surprised and a little shocked. </span>
<span sid='21536' title='21536'>'Why not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21537' title='21537'>'Because I always keep faith. </span>
<span sid='21538' title='21538'>I had promised when he first wrote that I would not try to trace him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21539' title='21539'>'You think there is some one behind him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21540' title='21540'>'I know there is.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21541' title='21541'>'This Professor that I have heard you mention?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21542' title='21542'>'Exactly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21543' title='21543'>Inspector MacDonald smiled, and his eyelid quivered as he glanced towards me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21544' title='21544'>'I won't conceal from you, Mr Holmes, that we think in the CID that you have a wee bit of a bee in your bonnet over this Professor. </span>
<span sid='21545' title='21545'>I made some inquiries myself about the matter. </span>
<span sid='21546' title='21546'>He seems to be a very respectable, learned, and talented sort of man.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21547' title='21547'>'I'm glad you've got as far as to recognize the talent.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21548' title='21548'>'Man, you can't but recognize it. </span>
<span sid='21549' title='21549'>After I heard your view, I made it my business to see him. </span>
<span sid='21550' title='21550'>I had a chat with him on eclipses - how the talk got that way I canna think - but he had out a reflector lantern and a globe and made it all clear in a minute. </span>
<span sid='21551' title='21551'>He lent me a book, but I don't mind saying that it was a bit above my head, though I had a good <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Aberdeen&t=h'>Aberdeen</a> upbringing. </span>
<span sid='21552' title='21552'>He'd have made a grand meenister, with his thin face and grey hair and solemn-like way of talking. </span>
<span sid='21553' title='21553'>When he put his hand on my shoulder as we were parting, it was like a father's blessing before you go out into the cold, cruel world.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21554' title='21554'>Holmes chuckled and rubbed his hands.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21555' title='21555'>'Great!' he cried; 'great! </span>
<span sid='21556' title='21556'>Tell me, friend MacDonald; this pleasing and touching interview was, I suppose, in the Professor's study?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21557' title='21557'>'That's so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21558' title='21558'>'A fine room, is it not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21559' title='21559'>'Very fine - very handsome indeed, Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21560' title='21560'>'You sat in front of his writing-desk?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21561' title='21561'>'Just so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21562' title='21562'>'Sun in your eyes and his face in the shadow?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21563' title='21563'>'Well, it was evening, but I mind that the lamp was turned on my face.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21564' title='21564'>'It would be. </span>
<span sid='21565' title='21565'>Did you happen to observe a picture over the Professor's head?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21566' title='21566'>'I don't miss much, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='21567' title='21567'>Maybe I learned that from you. </span>
<span sid='21568' title='21568'>Yes, I saw the picture - a young woman with her head on her hands, keeking at you sideways.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21569' title='21569'>'That painting was by Jean Baptiste Greuze!</span>
<p>
<span sid='21570' title='21570'>The inspector endeavoured to look interested.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21571' title='21571'>'Jean Baptiste Greuze', Holmes continued, joining his fingertips and leaning well back in his chair, 'was a French artist who flourished between the years 1750 and 1800. </span>
<span sid='21572' title='21572'>I allude, of course, to his working career. </span>
<span sid='21573' title='21573'>Modern criticism has more than endorsed the high opinion formed of him by his contemporaries.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21574' title='21574'>The inspector's eyes grew abstracted.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21575' title='21575'>'Hadn't we better-' he said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21576' title='21576'>'We are doing so,' Holmes interrupted. </span>
<span sid='21577' title='21577'>'All that I am saying has a very direct and vital bearing upon what you have called the Birlstone Mystery. </span>
<span sid='21578' title='21578'>In fact, it may in a sense be called the very centre of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21579' title='21579'>MacDonald smiled feebly, and looked appealingly to me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21580' title='21580'>'Your thoughts move a bit too quick for me, Mr Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21581' title='21581'>You leave out a link or two, and I can't get over the gap.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21582' title='21582'>What in the whole wide world can be the connection between this dead painting man and the affair at Birlstone?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21583' title='21583'>'All knowledge comes useful to the detective,' remarked Holmes. </span>
<span sid='21584' title='21584'>'Even the trivial fact that in the year 1865 a picture by Greuze, entitled "La Jeune Fille a l'agneau", fetched not less than four thousand pounds - at the Portalis sale - may start a train of reflection in your mind.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21585' title='21585'>It was clear that it did. </span>
<span sid='21586' title='21586'>The inspector looked honestly interested.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21587' title='21587'>'I may remind you,' Holmes continued, 'that the Professor's salary can be ascertained in several trustworthy books of reference. </span>
<span sid='21588' title='21588'>It is seven hundred a year:</span>
<p>
<span sid='21589' title='21589'>'Then how could he buy-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21590' title='21590'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='21591' title='21591'>How could he?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21592' title='21592'>'Aye, that's remarkable,' said the inspector, thoughtfully. </span>
<span sid='21593' title='21593'>'Talk away, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='21594' title='21594'>I'm just loving it. </span>
<span sid='21595' title='21595'>It's fine.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21596' title='21596'>Holmes smiled. </span>
<span sid='21597' title='21597'>He was always warmed by genuine admiration - the characteristic of the real artist.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21598' title='21598'>'What about Birlstone?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21599' title='21599'>'We've time yet,' said the inspector, glancing at his watch. </span>
<span sid='21600' title='21600'>'I've a cab at the door, and it won't take us twenty minutes to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Victoria&t=h'>Victoria</a>. </span>
<span sid='21601' title='21601'>But about this picture - I thought you told me once, Mr Holmes, that you had never met Professor Moriarty.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21602' title='21602'>'No, I never have.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21603' title='21603'>'Then how do you know about his rooms?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21604' title='21604'>'Ah, that's another matter. </span>
<span sid='21605' title='21605'>I have been three times in his rooms, twice waiting for him under different pretexts and leaving before he came. </span>
<span sid='21606' title='21606'>Once - well, I can hardly tell about the once to an official detective. </span>
<span sid='21607' title='21607'>It was on the last occasion that I took the liberty of running over his papers, with the most unexpected results.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21608' title='21608'>'You found something compromising?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21609' title='21609'>'Absolutely nothing. </span>
<span sid='21610' title='21610'>That was what amazed me. </span>
<span sid='21611' title='21611'>However, you have now seen the point of the picture. </span>
<span sid='21612' title='21612'>It shows him to be a very wealthy man. </span>
<span sid='21613' title='21613'>How did he acquire wealth? </span>
<span sid='21614' title='21614'>He is unmarried. </span>
<span sid='21615' title='21615'>His younger brother is a station-master in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the West&t=h'>the West</a> of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>. </span>
<span sid='21616' title='21616'>His chair is worth seven hundred a year. </span>
<span sid='21617' title='21617'>And he owns a Greuze.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21618' title='21618'>'Well?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21619' title='21619'>'Surely the inference is plain.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21620' title='21620'>'You mean that he has a great income, and that he must earn it in an illegal fashion?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21621' title='21621'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='21622' title='21622'>Of course, I have other reasons for thinking so - dozens of exiguous threads which lead vaguely up towards the centre of the web where the poisonous motionless creature is lurking. </span>
<span sid='21623' title='21623'>I only mention the Greuze because it brings the matter within the range of your own observation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21624' title='21624'>'Well, Mr Holmes, I admit that what you say is interesting. </span>
<span sid='21625' title='21625'>It's more than interesting - it's just wonderful. </span>
<span sid='21626' title='21626'>But let us have it a little clearer if you can. </span>
<span sid='21627' title='21627'>Is it forgery, coining, burglary? </span>
<span sid='21628' title='21628'>Where does the money come from?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21629' title='21629'>'Have you ever read of Jonathan Wild?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21630' title='21630'>'Well, the name has a familiar sound. </span>
<span sid='21631' title='21631'>Some one in a novel, was he not? </span>
<span sid='21632' title='21632'>I don't take much stock of detectives in novels chaps that do things and never let you see how they do them. </span>
<span sid='21633' title='21633'>That's just inspiration, not business.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21634' title='21634'>'Jonathan Wild wasn't a detective, and he wasn't in a novel. </span>
<span sid='21635' title='21635'>He was a master criminal, and he lived last century - 1750 or thereabouts.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21636' title='21636'>'Then he's no use to me. </span>
<span sid='21637' title='21637'>I'm a practical man.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21638' title='21638'>'Mr Mac, the most practical thing that ever you did in your life would be to shut yourself up for three months and read twelve hours a day at the annals of crime. </span>
<span sid='21639' title='21639'>Everything comes in circles, even Professor Moriarty. </span>
<span sid='21640' title='21640'>Jonathan Wild was the hidden force of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> criminals, to whom he sold his brains and his organization on a fifteen per cent commission. </span>
<span sid='21641' title='21641'>The old wheel turns and the same spoke comes up. </span>
<span sid='21642' title='21642'>It's all been done before and will be again. </span>
<span sid='21643' title='21643'>I'll tell you one or two things about Moriarty which may interest you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21644' title='21644'>'You'll interest me right enough.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21645' title='21645'>'I happen to know who is the first link in his chain - a chain with this Napoleon-gone-wrong at one end and a hundred broken fighting men, pickpockets, blackmailers, and card-sharpers at the other, with every sort of crime in between. </span>
<span sid='21646' title='21646'>His chief of the staff is Colonel Sebastian Moran, as aloof and guarded and inaccessible to the law as himself. </span>
<span sid='21647' title='21647'>What do you think he pays him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21648' title='21648'>'I'd like to hear.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21649' title='21649'>'Six thousand a year. </span>
<span sid='21650' title='21650'>That's paying for brains, you see - the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n business principle. </span>
<span sid='21651' title='21651'>I learned that detail quite by chance. </span>
<span sid='21652' title='21652'>It's more than the Prime Minister gets. </span>
<span sid='21653' title='21653'>That gives you an idea of Moriarty's gains and of the scale on which he works. </span>
<span sid='21654' title='21654'>Another point. </span>
<span sid='21655' title='21655'>I made it my business to hunt down some of Moriarty's cheques lately - just common innocent cheques that he pays his household bills with. </span>
<span sid='21656' title='21656'>They were drawn on six different banks. </span>
<span sid='21657' title='21657'>Does that make any impression on your mind?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21658' title='21658'>'Queer, certainly. </span>
<span sid='21659' title='21659'>But what do you gather from it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21660' title='21660'>'That he wanted no gossip about his wealth. </span>
<span sid='21661' title='21661'>No single man should know what he had. </span>
<span sid='21662' title='21662'>I have no doubt that he has twenty banking accounts - the bulk of his fortune abroad in the Deutsche Bank or the Crédit Lyonnais as likely as not. </span>
<span sid='21663' title='21663'>Some time when you have a year or two to spare I commend to you the study of Professor Moriarty.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21664' title='21664'>Inspector MacDonald had grown steadily more impressed as the conversation proceeded. </span>
<span sid='21665' title='21665'>He had lost himself in his interest. </span>
<span sid='21666' title='21666'>Now his practical Scotch intelligence brought him back with a snap to the matter in hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21667' title='21667'>'He can keep, anyhow,' said he. </span>
<span sid='21668' title='21668'>'You've got us sidetracked with your interesting anecdotes, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='21669' title='21669'>What really counts is your remark that there is some connection between the Professor and the crime. </span>
<span sid='21670' title='21670'>That you get from the warning received through the man Porlock. </span>
<span sid='21671' title='21671'>Can we for our present practical needs get any farther than that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21672' title='21672'>'We may form some conception as to the motives of the crime. </span>
<span sid='21673' title='21673'>It is, as I gather from your original remarks, an inexplicable, or at least an unexplained, murder. </span>
<span sid='21674' title='21674'>Now, presuming that the source of the crime is as we suspect it to be, there might be two different motives. </span>
<span sid='21675' title='21675'>In the first place, I may tell you that Moriarty rules with a rod of iron over his people. </span>
<span sid='21676' title='21676'>His discipline is tremendous. </span>
<span sid='21677' title='21677'>There is only one punishment in his code. </span>
<span sid='21678' title='21678'>It is death. </span>
<span sid='21679' title='21679'>Now, we might suppose that this murdered man - this Douglas, whose approaching fate was known by one of the arch-criminal's subordinates had in some way betrayed the chief. </span>
<span sid='21680' title='21680'>His punishment followed and would be known to all, if only to put the fear of death into them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21681' title='21681'>'Well, that is one suggestion, Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21682' title='21682'>'The other is that it has been engineered by Moriarty in the ordinary course of business. </span>
<span sid='21683' title='21683'>Was there any robbery?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21684' title='21684'>'I have not heard.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21685' title='21685'>'If so it would, of course, be against the first hypothesis and in favour of the second. </span>
<span sid='21686' title='21686'>Moriarty may have been engaged to engineer it on a promise of part spoils, or he may have been paid so much down to manage it. </span>
<span sid='21687' title='21687'>Either is possible. </span>
<span sid='21688' title='21688'>But, whichever it may be, or if it is some third combination, it is down at Birlstone that we must seek the solution. </span>
<span sid='21689' title='21689'>I know our man too well w suppose that he bas left anything up here which may lead us to him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21690' title='21690'>'Then to Birlstone we must go!' cried MacDonald, jumping from his chair. </span>
<span sid='21691' title='21691'>'My word! it's later than I thought. </span>
<span sid='21692' title='21692'>I can give you gentlemen five minutes for preparation, and that is all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21693' title='21693'>'And ample for us both,' said Holmes, as he sprang up and hastened to change from his dressing-gown to his coat. </span>
<span sid='21694' title='21694'>'While we are on our way, Mr Mac, I will ask you to be good enough to tell me all about it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21695' title='21695'>'All about it' proved to be disappointingly little, and yet there was enough to assure us that the case before us might well be worthy of the expert's closest attention. </span>
<span sid='21696' title='21696'>He brightened and rubbed bis thin hands together as he listened to the meagre but remarkable details. </span>
<span sid='21697' title='21697'>A long series of sterile weeks lay behind us, and here, at last, there was a fitting Object for those remarkable powers which, like all special gifts, become irksome to their owner when they are not in use. </span>
<span sid='21698' title='21698'>That razor brain blunted and rusted with inaction. </span>
<span sid='21699' title='21699'>Sherlock Holmes's eyes glistened, his pale checks took a warmer hue, and bis whole eager face shone with an inward light when the call for work reached him. </span>
<span sid='21700' title='21700'>Leaning forward in the cab, he listened intently to MacDonald's short sketch of the problem which awaited us in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sussex&t=h'>Sussex</a>. </span>
<span sid='21701' title='21701'>The inspector was himself dependent, as he explained to us, upon a scribbled account forwarded to him by the milk train in the early hours of the morning. </span>
<span sid='21702' title='21702'>White Mason, the local officer, was a personal friend, and hence MacDonald had been notified very much more promptly than is usual at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a> when provincials need their assistance. </span>
<span sid='21703' title='21703'>It is a very cold scent upon which the Metropolitan expert is generally asked to run.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21704' title='21704'>'Dear Inspector MacDonald,' said the letter which he read to us, 'official requisition for your services is in separate envelope. </span>
<span sid='21705' title='21705'>This is for your private eye. </span>
<span sid='21706' title='21706'>Wire me what train in the morning you can get for Birlstone, and I will meet it - or have it met if I am too occupied. </span>
<span sid='21707' title='21707'>This case is a snorter. </span>
<span sid='21708' title='21708'>Don't waste a moment in getting started. </span>
<span sid='21709' title='21709'>If you can bring Mr Holmes, please do so, for he will find something alter his own heart. </span>
<span sid='21710' title='21710'>You would think the whole thing had been fixed up for theatrical effect, if there wasn't a dead man in the middle of it. </span>
<span sid='21711' title='21711'>My word, it is a snorter!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21712' title='21712'>'Your friend seems to be no fool,' remarked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21713' title='21713'>'No sir; White Mason is a very live man, if I am any judge.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21714' title='21714'>'Well, have you anything more?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21715' title='21715'>'Only that he will give us every detail when we meet.' </span>
<span sid='21716' title='21716'>'Then how did you get at Mr Douglas and the fact that he had been horribly murdered?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21717' title='21717'>'That was in the enclosed official report. </span>
<span sid='21718' title='21718'>It didn't say "horrible". </span>
<span sid='21719' title='21719'>That's not a recognized official term. </span>
<span sid='21720' title='21720'>It gave the name John Douglas. </span>
<span sid='21721' title='21721'>It mentioned that his injuries had been in the head, from the discharge of a shot-gun. </span>
<span sid='21722' title='21722'>It also mentioned the hour of the alarm, which was close on to midnight last night. </span>
<span sid='21723' title='21723'>It added that the case was undoubtedly one of murder, but that no arrest had been made, and that the case was one which presented some very perplexing and extraordinary features. </span>
<span sid='21724' title='21724'>That's absolutely all we have at present, Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21725' title='21725'>'Then, with your permission, we will leave it at that, Mr Mac. </span>
<span sid='21726' title='21726'>The temptation to form premature theories upon insufficient data is the bane of our profession. </span>
<span sid='21727' title='21727'>I can only see two things for certain at present: a great brain in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> and a dead man in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sussex&t=h'>Sussex</a>. </span>
<span sid='21728' title='21728'>It's the chain between that we are going to trace.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21729' title='21729'>CHAPTER 3 : The Tragedy of Birlstone</span>
<p>
<span sid='21730' title='21730'>And now for a moment I will ask leave to remove my own insignificant personality and to describe events which occured before we arrived upon the scene by the light of knowledge which came to us afterwards. </span>
<span sid='21731' title='21731'>Only in this way can I make the reader appreciate the people concerned and the strange setting in which their fate was cast.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21732' title='21732'>The village of Birlstone is a small and very ancient cluster of half-timbered cottages on the northern border of the country of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sussex&t=h'>Sussex</a>. </span>
<span sid='21733' title='21733'>For centuries it had remained unchanged, but within the last few years its picturesque appearance and situation have attracted a number of well-to-do residents, whose villas peep out from the woods around. </span>
<span sid='21734' title='21734'>These woods are locally supposed to be the extreme fringe of the great Weald forest, which thins away until it reaches the northern chalk downs. </span>
<span sid='21735' title='21735'>A number of small shops have come into being to meet the wants of the increased population, so that there seems some prospect that Birlstone may soon grow from an ancient village into a modern town. </span>
<span sid='21736' title='21736'>It is the centre for a considerable area of country, since <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Tunbridge Wells&t=h'>Tunbridge Wells</a>, the nearest place of importance, is ten or twelve miles to the eastward, over the borders of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kent&t=h'>Kent</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21737' title='21737'>About half a mile from the town, standing in an old park famous for its huge beech trees, is the ancient Manor House of Birlstone. </span>
<span sid='21738' title='21738'>Part of this venerable building dates back to the time of the first Crusade, when Hugo de Capus built a fortalice in the centre of the estate, which had been granted to him by the Red King. </span>
<span sid='21739' title='21739'>This was destroyed by fire in 1543, and some of its smoke-blackened corner-stones were used when, in Jacobean times, a brick country house rose upon the ruins of the feudal castle. </span>
<span sid='21740' title='21740'>The Manor House, with its many gables and its small, diamond-paned windows, was still much as the builder had left it in the early seventeenth century. </span>
<span sid='21741' title='21741'>Of the double moats which had guarded its more warlike predecessor the outer had been allowed to dry up, and served the humble function of a kitchen garden. </span>
<span sid='21742' title='21742'>The inner one was still there, and lay, forty feet in breadth, though now only a few feet in depth, round the whole house. </span>
<span sid='21743' title='21743'>A small stream fed it and continued beyond it, so that the sheet of water, though turbid, was never ditch-like or unhealthy. </span>
<span sid='21744' title='21744'>The ground floor windows were within a foot of the surface of the water. </span>
<span sid='21745' title='21745'>The only approach to the house was over a drawbridge, the chains and windlass of which had long been rusted and broken. </span>
<span sid='21746' title='21746'>The latest tenants of the Manor House had, however, with characteristic energy, set this right, and the drawbridge was not only capable of being raised, but actually was raised every evening and lowered every morning. </span>
<span sid='21747' title='21747'>By thus renewing the custom of the old feudal days the Manor House was converted into an island during the night - a fact which had a very direct bearing upon the mystery which was soon to engage the attention of all <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21748' title='21748'>The house had been untenanted for some years, and was threatening to moulder into a picturesque decay when the Douglases took possession of it. </span>
<span sid='21749' title='21749'>This family consisted of only two individuals, John Douglas and his wife. </span>
<span sid='21750' title='21750'>Douglas was a remarkable man both in character and in person; in age he may have been about fifty, with a strong-jawed, rugged face, a grizzling moustache, peculiarly keen grey eyes, and a wiry, vigorous figure which had lost nothing of the strength and activity of youth. </span>
<span sid='21751' title='21751'>He was cheery and genial to all, but somewhat offhand in his manners, giving the impression that he had seen life in social strata on some far lower horizon than the county society of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sussex&t=h'>Sussex</a>. </span>
<span sid='21752' title='21752'>Yet, though looked at with some curiosity and reserve by bis more cultivated neighbours, he soon acquired a great popularity among the villagers, subscribing handsomely to all local objects, and attending their smoking concerts and other functions, where, having a remarkably rich tenor voice, he was always ready to oblige with an excellent song. </span>
<span sid='21753' title='21753'>He appeared to have plenty of money, which was said to have been gained in the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=California&t=h'>California</a>n gold-fields, and it was clear from his own talk and that of his wife that he had spent a part of lis life in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>. </span>
<span sid='21754' title='21754'>The good impression which had been produced by his generosity and by his democratic manners was increased by a reputation gained for utter indifference to danger. </span>
<span sid='21755' title='21755'>Though a wretched rider, he turned out at every meet, and took the most amazing falls in his determination to hold his own with the best. </span>
<span sid='21756' title='21756'>When the vicarage caught fire he distinguished himself also by the fearlessness with which he re-entered the building to save property, after the local fire brigade had given it up as impossible. </span>
<span sid='21757' title='21757'>Thus it came about that John Douglas, of the Manor House, had within five years won himself quite a reputation in Birlstone.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21758' title='21758'>His wife, too, was popular with those who had made her acquaintance, though, after the English fashion, the callers upon a stranger who settled in the county without introductions were few and far between. </span>
<span sid='21759' title='21759'>This mattered less to her as she was retiring by disposition and very much absorbed, to all appearance, in her husband and her domestic duties. </span>
<span sid='21760' title='21760'>It was known that she was an English lady who had met Mr Douglas in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, he being at that time a widower. </span>
<span sid='21761' title='21761'>She was a beautiful woman, tall, dark, and slender, some twenty years younger than her husband, a disparity which seemed in no wise to mar the contentment of their family life. </span>
<span sid='21762' title='21762'>It was remarked sometimes, however, by those who knew them best that the confidence between the two did not appear to be complete, since the wife was either very reticent about her husband's past life or else, as seemed more likely, was very imperfectly informed about it. </span>
<span sid='21763' title='21763'>It had also been noted and commented upon by a few observant people that there were signs sometimes of some nerve-strain upon the part of Mrs Douglas, and that she would display acute uneasiness if her absent husband should ever be particularly late in bis return.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21764' title='21764'>On a quiet countryside, where all gossip is welcome, this weakness of the lady of the Manor House did not pass without remark, and it bulked larger upon people's memory when the events arose which gave it a very special significance.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21765' title='21765'>There was yet another individual whose residence under that roof was, it is true, only an intermittent one, but whose presence at the time of the strange happenings which will now be narrated brought his name prominently before the public. </span>
<span sid='21766' title='21766'>This was Cecil James Barker, of Hales Lodge, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Hampstead&t=h'>Hampstead</a>. </span>
<span sid='21767' title='21767'>Cecil Barker's tall, loose-jointed figure was a familiar one in the main Street of Birlstone village, for he was a frequent and welcome visitor at the Manor House. </span>
<span sid='21768' title='21768'>He was the more noticed as being the only friend of the past unknown life of Mr Douglas who was ever seen in his new English surroundings. </span>
<span sid='21769' title='21769'>Barker was himself an undoubted Englishman, but by his remarks it was clear that he had first known Douglas in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>, and had there lived on intimate terms with him. </span>
<span sid='21770' title='21770'>He appeared to be a man of considerable wealth, and was reputed to be a bachelor. </span>
<span sid='21771' title='21771'>In age he was rather younger than Douglas, forty-five at the most, a tall, straight, broad-chested fellow, with a clean-shaven, prizefighter face, thick, strong, black eyebrows, and a pair of masterful black eyes which might, even without the aid of his very capable hands, clear a way for him through a hostile crowd. </span>
<span sid='21772' title='21772'>He neither rode nor shot, but spent his days in wandering round the old village with his pipe in bis mouth, or in driving with his host, or in his absence with his hostess, over the beautiful countryside. </span>
<span sid='21773' title='21773'>'An easy-going, freehanded gentleman,' said Ames, the butler. </span>
<span sid='21774' title='21774'>'But, my word, I had rather not be the man that crossed him.' </span>
<span sid='21775' title='21775'>He was cordial and intimate with Douglas, and he was no less friendly with his wife, a friendship which more than once seemed to cause some irritation to the husband, so that even the servants were able to perceive his annoyance. </span>
<span sid='21776' title='21776'>Such was the third person who was one of the family when the catastrophe occurred. </span>
<span sid='21777' title='21777'>As to the other denizens of the old building, it will suffice out of a large household to mention the prim, respectable, and capable Ames and Mrs Allen, a buxom and cheerful person, who relieved the lady of some of her household cares. </span>
<span sid='21778' title='21778'>The other six servants in the house bear no relation to the events of the night of January 6th.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21779' title='21779'>It was at eleven forty-five that the first alarm reached the small local police-station in the charge of Sergeant Wilson, of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sussex&t=h'>Sussex</a> Constabulary. </span>
<span sid='21780' title='21780'>Mr Cecil Barker, much excited, had rushed up to the door and pealed furiously upon the bell. </span>
<span sid='21781' title='21781'>A terrible tragedy had occurred at the Manor House, and Mr John Douglas had been murdered. </span>
<span sid='21782' title='21782'>That was the breathless burden of his message. </span>
<span sid='21783' title='21783'>He had hurried back to the house, followed within a few minutes by the police sergeant, who arrived at the scene of the crime a little past twelve o'clock, after taking prompt steps to warn the county authorities that something serious was afoot.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21784' title='21784'>On reaching the Manor House the sergeant had found the drawbridge down, the windows lighted up, and the whole household in a state of wild confusion and alarm. </span>
<span sid='21785' title='21785'>The white-faced servants were huddling together in the hall, with the frightened butler wringing his hands in the doorway. </span>
<span sid='21786' title='21786'>Only Cecil Barker seemed to be master of himself and his emotions. </span>
<span sid='21787' title='21787'>He had opened the door which was nearest to the entrance, and had beckoned to the sergeant to follow him. </span>
<span sid='21788' title='21788'>At that moment there arrived Dr Wood, a brisk and capable general practitioner from the village. </span>
<span sid='21789' title='21789'>The three men entered the fatal room together, while the horror-stricken butler followed at their heels, closing the door behind him to shut out the terrible scene from the maid-servants.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21790' title='21790'>The dead man lay upon his back, sprawling with outstretched limbs in the centre of the room. </span>
<span sid='21791' title='21791'>He was clad only in a pink dressing-gown, which covered his night clothes. </span>
<span sid='21792' title='21792'>There were carpet slippers upon his bare feet. </span>
<span sid='21793' title='21793'>The doctor knelt beside him, and held down the hand-lamp which had stood on the table. </span>
<span sid='21794' title='21794'>One glance at the victim was enough to show the healer that his presence could be dispensed with. </span>
<span sid='21795' title='21795'>The man had been horribly injured. </span>
<span sid='21796' title='21796'>Lying across his chest was a curious weapon, a shot-gun with the barrel sawn off a foot in front of the triggers. </span>
<span sid='21797' title='21797'>It was clear that this had been fired at dose range, and that he had received the whole charge in the face, blowing his head almost to pieces. </span>
<span sid='21798' title='21798'>The triggers had been wired together, so as to make the simultaneous discharge more destructive.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21799' title='21799'>The country policeman was unnerved and troubled by the tremendous responsibility which had come so suddenly upon him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21800' title='21800'>'We will touch nothing until my superiors arrive,' he said, in a hushed voice, staring in horror at the dreadful head.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21801' title='21801'>'Nothing has been touched up to now,' said Cecil Barker. </span>
<span sid='21802' title='21802'>'I'll answer for that. </span>
<span sid='21803' title='21803'>You see it all exactly as I found it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21804' title='21804'>'When was that?' </span>
<span sid='21805' title='21805'>The sergeant had drawn out his note-book.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21806' title='21806'>'It was just half-past eleven. </span>
<span sid='21807' title='21807'>I had not begun to undress, and I was sitting by the fire in my bedroom, when I heard the report. </span>
<span sid='21808' title='21808'>It was not very loud - it seemed to be muffled. </span>
<span sid='21809' title='21809'>I rushed down. </span>
<span sid='21810' title='21810'>I don't suppose it was thirty seconds before I was in the room.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21811' title='21811'>'Was the door open?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21812' title='21812'>'Yes, it was open. </span>
<span sid='21813' title='21813'>Poor Douglas was lying as you see him. </span>
<span sid='21814' title='21814'>His bedroom candle was burning on the table. </span>
<span sid='21815' title='21815'>It was I who lit the lamp some minutes afterwards.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21816' title='21816'>'Did you see no one?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21817' title='21817'>'No. </span>
<span sid='21818' title='21818'>I heard Mrs Douglas coming down the stair behind me, and I rushed out to prevent her from seeing this dreadful sight. </span>
<span sid='21819' title='21819'>Mrs Allen, the housekeeper, came and took her away. </span>
<span sid='21820' title='21820'>Ames had arrived, and we ran back into the room once more.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21821' title='21821'>'But surely I have heard that the drawbridge is kept up all night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21822' title='21822'>'Yes, it was up until I lowered it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21823' title='21823'>'Then how could any murderer have got away? </span>
<span sid='21824' title='21824'>It is out of the question. </span>
<span sid='21825' title='21825'>Mr Douglas must have shot himself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21826' title='21826'>'That was our first idea. </span>
<span sid='21827' title='21827'>But see.' </span>
<span sid='21828' title='21828'>Barker drew aside the curtain, and showed that the long, diamond-paned window was open to its full extent. </span>
<span sid='21829' title='21829'>'And look at this!' </span>
<span sid='21830' title='21830'>He held the lamp down and illuminated a smudge of blood like the mark of a boot-sole upon the wooden sill. </span>
<span sid='21831' title='21831'>'Some one has stood there in getting out.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21832' title='21832'>'You mean that some one waded across the moat?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21833' title='21833'>'Exactly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21834' title='21834'>'Then, if you were in the room within half a minute of the crime, he must have been in the water at that very moment.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21835' title='21835'>'I have not a doubt of it. </span>
<span sid='21836' title='21836'>I wish to Heaven that I had rushed to the window. </span>
<span sid='21837' title='21837'>But the curtain screened it, as you can see, and so it never occurred to me. </span>
<span sid='21838' title='21838'>Then I heard the step of Mrs Douglas, and I could not let her enter the room. </span>
<span sid='21839' title='21839'>It would have been too horrible.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21840' title='21840'>'Horrible enough!' said the doctor, looking at the shattered head and the terrible marks which surrounded it. </span>
<span sid='21841' title='21841'>'I've never seen such injuries since the Birlstone railway smash.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21842' title='21842'>'But, I say,' remarked the police-sergeant, whose slow, bucolic common sense was still pondering over the open window. </span>
<span sid='21843' title='21843'>'It's all very well your saying that a man escaped by wading this moat, but what I ask you is - how did he ever get into the house at all if the bridge was up?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21844' title='21844'>'Ah, that's the question,' said Barker.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21845' title='21845'>'At what o'clock was it raised?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21846' title='21846'>'It was nearly six o'clock,' said Ames, the butler.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21847' title='21847'>'I've heard,' said the sergeant, 'that it was usually raised at sunset. </span>
<span sid='21848' title='21848'>That would be nearer half-past four than six at this time of year.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21849' title='21849'>'Mrs Douglas had visitors to tea,' said Ames. </span>
<span sid='21850' title='21850'>'I couldn't raise it until they went. </span>
<span sid='21851' title='21851'>Then I wound it up myself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21852' title='21852'>'Then it comes to this,' said the sergeant. </span>
<span sid='21853' title='21853'>'If anyone came from outside - if they did - they must have got in across the bridge before six and been in hiding ever since, until Mr Douglas came into the room after eleven.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21854' title='21854'>'That is so. </span>
<span sid='21855' title='21855'>Mr Douglas went round the house every night the last thing before he turned in to see that the lights were right. </span>
<span sid='21856' title='21856'>That brought him in here. </span>
<span sid='21857' title='21857'>The man was waiting, and shot him. </span>
<span sid='21858' title='21858'>Then he got away through the window and left his gun behind him. </span>
<span sid='21859' title='21859'>That's how I read it - for nothing else will fit the facts.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21860' title='21860'>The sergeant picked up a card which lay beside the dead man upon the floor. </span>
<span sid='21861' title='21861'>The initials V.V., and under it the number 341, were rudely scrawled in ink upon it.'What's this?' he asked, holding it up.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21862' title='21862'>Barker looked at it with curiosity.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21863' title='21863'>'I never noticed it before,' he said. </span>
<span sid='21864' title='21864'>'The murderer must have left it behind him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21865' title='21865'>"V.V. 341." </span>
<span sid='21866' title='21866'>I can make no sense of that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21867' title='21867'>The sergeant kept turning it over in his big fingers. </span>
<span sid='21868' title='21868'>'What's V.V.? </span>
<span sid='21869' title='21869'>Somebody's initials, maybe. </span>
<span sid='21870' title='21870'>What have you got there, Dr Wood?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21871' title='21871'>It was a good-sized hammer which had been lying upon the rug in front of the fireplace - a substantial, workmanlike hammer. </span>
<span sid='21872' title='21872'>Cecil Barker pointed to a box of brass-headed nails upon the mantelpiece.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21873' title='21873'>'Mr. Douglas was altering the pictures yesterday,' he said. </span>
<span sid='21874' title='21874'>'I saw him myself standing upon that chair and fixing the big picture above it. </span>
<span sid='21875' title='21875'>That accounts for the hammer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21876' title='21876'>'We'd best put it back on the rug where we found it,' said the sergeant, scratching his puzzled head in his perplexity. </span>
<span sid='21877' title='21877'>'It will want the best brains in the force to get to the bottom of this thing. </span>
<span sid='21878' title='21878'>It will be a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> job before it is finished.' </span>
<span sid='21879' title='21879'>He raised the hand-lamp and walked slowly round the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21880' title='21880'>'Hullo!' he cried, excitedly, drawing the window curtain to one side. </span>
<span sid='21881' title='21881'>'What o'clock were those curtains drawn?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21882' title='21882'>'When the lamps were lit,' said the butler. </span>
<span sid='21883' title='21883'>'It would be shortly after four.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21884' title='21884'>'Some one has been hiding here, sure enough.' </span>
<span sid='21885' title='21885'>He held down the light, and the marks of muddy boots were very visible in the comer. </span>
<span sid='21886' title='21886'>'I'm bound to say this bears out your theory, Mr Barker. </span>
<span sid='21887' title='21887'>It looks as if the man got into the house after four, when the curtains were drawn, and before six, when the bridge was raised. </span>
<span sid='21888' title='21888'>He slipped into this room because it was the first that he saw. </span>
<span sid='21889' title='21889'>There was no other place where he could hide, so he popped in behind this curtain. </span>
<span sid='21890' title='21890'>That all seems clear enough. </span>
<span sid='21891' title='21891'>It is likely that his main idea was to burgle the house, but Mr Douglas chanced to come upon him, so he murdered him and escaped.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21892' title='21892'>'That's how I read it,' said Barker. </span>
<span sid='21893' title='21893'>'But, I say, aren't we wasting precious time? </span>
<span sid='21894' title='21894'>Couldn't we start out and scour the country before the fellow gets away?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21895' title='21895'>The sergeant considered for a moment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21896' title='21896'>'There are no trains before six in the morning, so he can't get away by rail. </span>
<span sid='21897' title='21897'>If he goes by road with his legs all dripping, it's odds that some one will notice him. </span>
<span sid='21898' title='21898'>Anyhow, I can't leave here myself until I am relieved. </span>
<span sid='21899' title='21899'>But I think none of you should go until we see more clearly how we all stand.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21900' title='21900'>The doctor had taken the lamp and was narrowly scrutinizing the body.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21901' title='21901'>'What's this mark?' he asked. </span>
<span sid='21902' title='21902'>'Could this have any connection with the crime?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21903' title='21903'>The dead man's right arm was thrust out from his dressing-gown and exposed as high as the elbow. </span>
<span sid='21904' title='21904'>About halfway up the forearm was a curious brown design, a triangle inside a circle, standing out in vivid relief upon the lard-coloured skin.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21905' title='21905'>'It's not tattooed,' said the doctor, peering through his glasses. </span>
<span sid='21906' title='21906'>'I never saw anything like it. </span>
<span sid='21907' title='21907'>The man has been branded at some time, as they brand cattle. </span>
<span sid='21908' title='21908'>What is the meaning of this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21909' title='21909'>'I don't profess to know the meaning of it,' said Cecil Barker; 'but I've seen the mark on Douglas any time this last ten years.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21910' title='21910'>'And so have I,' said the butler. </span>
<span sid='21911' title='21911'>'Many a time when the master has rolled up lis sleeves I have noticed that very mark. </span>
<span sid='21912' title='21912'>I've often wondered what it could be.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21913' title='21913'>'Then it has nothing to do with the crime, anyhow,' said the sergeant. </span>
<span sid='21914' title='21914'>'But it's a rum thing all the same. </span>
<span sid='21915' title='21915'>Everything about this case is rum. </span>
<span sid='21916' title='21916'>Well, what is it now?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21917' title='21917'>The butler had given an exclamation of astonishment, and was pointing at the dead man's outstretched hand. </span>
<span sid='21918' title='21918'>'They've taken his wedding-ring!' he gasped.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21919' title='21919'>'What!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21920' title='21920'>'Yes, indeed! </span>
<span sid='21921' title='21921'>Master always wore his plain gold wedding ring on the little finger of his left hand. </span>
<span sid='21922' title='21922'>That ring with the rough nugget on it was above it, and the twisted snake-ring on the third finger. </span>
<span sid='21923' title='21923'>There's the nugget, and there's the snake, but the wedding-ring is gone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21924' title='21924'>'He's right,' said Barker.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21925' title='21925'>'Do you tell me,' said the sergeant, 'that the wedding-ring was below the other?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21926' title='21926'>'Always!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21927' title='21927'>'Then the murderer, or whoever it was, first took off this you call the nugget-ring, then the wedding-ring, and afterwards put the nugget-ring back again.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21928' title='21928'>'That is so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21929' title='21929'>The worthy country policeman shook his head.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21930' title='21930'>Seems to me the sooner we get <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> on to this case the better,' said he. </span>
<span sid='21931' title='21931'>'White Mason is a smart man. </span>
<span sid='21932' title='21932'>No local job has ever been too much for White Mason. </span>
<span sid='21933' title='21933'>It won't be long now before he is here to help us. </span>
<span sid='21934' title='21934'>But I expect we'll have to look to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> before we are through. </span>
<span sid='21935' title='21935'>Anyhow, I'm not ashamed to say that it is a deal too thick for the likes of me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21936' title='21936'>CHAPTER 4 : Darkness</span>
<p>
<span sid='21937' title='21937'>At three in the morning the chief <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sussex&t=h'>Sussex</a> detective, obeying the urgent cal! </span>
<span sid='21938' title='21938'>from Sergeant Wilson, of Birlstone, arrived from headquarters in a light dog-cart behind a breathless trotter. </span>
<span sid='21939' title='21939'>By the five-forty train in the morning he had sent his message to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>, and he was at the Birlstone station at twelve o'clock to welcome us. </span>
<span sid='21940' title='21940'>Mr White Mason was a quiet, comfortable-looking person, in a loose tweed suit, with a clean-shaven, ruddy face, a stoutish body, and powerful bandy legs adorned with gaiters, looking like small farmer, a retired gamekeeper, or anything upon earth except a very favourable specimen of the provincial criminal officer.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21941' title='21941'>'A real downright snorter, Mr MacDonald,' he kept repeating. </span>
<span sid='21942' title='21942'>'We'll have the pressmen down like flies when they understand it. </span>
<span sid='21943' title='21943'>I'm hoping we will get our work done before they get poking their noses into it and messing up all the trails. </span>
<span sid='21944' title='21944'>There has been nothing like this that I can remember. </span>
<span sid='21945' title='21945'>There are some bits that will come home to you, Mr Holmes, or I am mistaken. </span>
<span sid='21946' title='21946'>And you also, Dr Watson, for the medicos will have a word to say before we finish. </span>
<span sid='21947' title='21947'>Your room is at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the West&t=h'>the West</a>ville Arms. </span>
<span sid='21948' title='21948'>There's no other place, but I hear that it is clean and good. </span>
<span sid='21949' title='21949'>The man will carry your bags. </span>
<span sid='21950' title='21950'>This way, gentlemen, if you please.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21951' title='21951'>He was a very bustling and genial person, this <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sussex&t=h'>Sussex</a> detective. </span>
<span sid='21952' title='21952'>In ten minutes we had all found our quarters. </span>
<span sid='21953' title='21953'>In ten more we were seated in the parlour of the inn and being treated to a rapid sketch of those events which have been outlined in the previous chapter. </span>
<span sid='21954' title='21954'>MacDonald made an occasional note, while Holmes sat absorbed with the expression of surprised and reverent admiration with which the botanist surveys the rare and precious bloom.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21955' title='21955'>'Remarkable!' he said, when the story was unfolded. </span>
<span sid='21956' title='21956'>'Most remarkable! </span>
<span sid='21957' title='21957'>I can hardly recall any case where the features have been more peculiar.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21958' title='21958'>'I thought you would say so, Mr Holmes,' said White Mason, in great delight. </span>
<span sid='21959' title='21959'>'We're well up with the times in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sussex&t=h'>Sussex</a>. </span>
<span sid='21960' title='21960'>I've told you now how matters were, up to the time when I took over from Sergeant Wilson between three and four this morning. </span>
<span sid='21961' title='21961'>My word, I made the old mare go! </span>
<span sid='21962' title='21962'>But I need not have been in such a hurry as it turned out, for there was nothing immediate that I could do. </span>
<span sid='21963' title='21963'>Sergeant Wilson had all the facts. </span>
<span sid='21964' title='21964'>I checked them and considered them, and maybe added a few on my own.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21965' title='21965'>'What were they?' asked Holmes, eagerly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21966' title='21966'>'Well, I first had the hammer examined. </span>
<span sid='21967' title='21967'>There was Dr Wood there to help me. </span>
<span sid='21968' title='21968'>We found no signs of violence upon it. </span>
<span sid='21969' title='21969'>I was hoping that, if Mr Douglas defended himself with the hammer, he might have left his mark upon the murderer before he dropped it on the mat. </span>
<span sid='21970' title='21970'>But there was no stain.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21971' title='21971'>'That, of course, proves nothing at all,' remarked Inspector MacDonald. </span>
<span sid='21972' title='21972'>'There has been many a hammer murder and no trace on the hammer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21973' title='21973'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='21974' title='21974'>It doesn't prove it wasn't used. </span>
<span sid='21975' title='21975'>But there might have been stains, and that would have helped us. </span>
<span sid='21976' title='21976'>As a matter of fact, there were none. </span>
<span sid='21977' title='21977'>Then I examined the gun. </span>
<span sid='21978' title='21978'>They were buck-shot cartridges, and, as Sergeant Wilson pointed out, the triggers were wired together so that if you pulled on the hinder one both barrels were discharged. </span>
<span sid='21979' title='21979'>Whoever fixed that up had made up his mind that he was going to take no chances of missing his man. </span>
<span sid='21980' title='21980'>The sawn gun was not more than two feet long; one could carry it easily under one's coat. </span>
<span sid='21981' title='21981'>There was no complete maker's name, but the printed letters "P E N" were on the fluting between the barrels, and the rest of the name had been cut off by the saw.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21982' title='21982'>'A big "P" with a flourish above it - "E" and "N" smaller?' asked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21983' title='21983'>'Exactly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21984' title='21984'>'<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pennsylvania&t=h'>Pennsylvania</a> Small Arm Company - well-known <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n firm,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21985' title='21985'>White Mason gazed at my friend as the little village practitioner looks at the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Harley Street&t=h'>Harley Street</a> specialist who by a word can solve the difficulties that perplex him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21986' title='21986'>'That is very helpful, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='21987' title='21987'>No doubt you are right. </span>
<span sid='21988' title='21988'>Wonderful - wonderful! </span>
<span sid='21989' title='21989'>Do you carry the names of all the gunmakers in the world in your memory?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21990' title='21990'>Holmes dismissed the subject with a wave.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21991' title='21991'>'No doubt it is an <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n shot-gun,' White Mason continued. </span>
<span sid='21992' title='21992'>'I seem to have read that a sawed-off shot-gun is a weapon used in some parts of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>. </span>
<span sid='21993' title='21993'>Apart from the name upon the barrel, the idea had occurred to me. </span>
<span sid='21994' title='21994'>There is some evidence, then, that this man who entered the house and killed its master was an <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21995' title='21995'>MacDonald shook his head. </span>
<span sid='21996' title='21996'>'Man, you are surely travelling over-fast,' said he. </span>
<span sid='21997' title='21997'>'I have heard no evidence yet that any stranger was ever in the house at all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21998' title='21998'>'The open window, the blood on the sill, the queer card, marks of boots in the corner, the gun.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21999' title='21999'>'Nothing there that could not have been arranged. </span>
<span sid='22000' title='22000'>Mr Douglas was an <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n, or had lived long in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>. </span>
<span sid='22001' title='22001'>So had Mr Barker. </span>
<span sid='22002' title='22002'>You don't need to import an <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n from outside in order to account for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n doings.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22003' title='22003'>'Ames, the butler-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22004' title='22004'>'What about him? </span>
<span sid='22005' title='22005'>Is he reliable?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22006' title='22006'>'Ten years with Sir Charles Chandos - as solid as a rock. </span>
<span sid='22007' title='22007'>He has been with Douglas ever since he took the Manor House five years ago. </span>
<span sid='22008' title='22008'>He has never seen a gun of this sort in the house.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22009' title='22009'>'The gun was made to conceal. </span>
<span sid='22010' title='22010'>That's why the barrels were sawn. </span>
<span sid='22011' title='22011'>It would fit into any box. </span>
<span sid='22012' title='22012'>How could he swear there was no such gun in the house?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22013' title='22013'>'Well, anyhow he had never seen one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22014' title='22014'>MacDonald shook his obstinate Scotch head. </span>
<span sid='22015' title='22015'>'I'm not convinced yet that there was ever anyone in the house,' said he. </span>
<span sid='22016' title='22016'>'I'm asking you to conseedar' - his accent became more Aberdonian as he lost himself in his argument - 'I'm asking you to conseedar what it involves if you suppose that this gun was ever brought into the house and that all these strange things were done by a person from outside. </span>
<span sid='22017' title='22017'>Oh, man, it's just inconceivable! </span>
<span sid='22018' title='22018'>It's clean against common sense. </span>
<span sid='22019' title='22019'>I put it to you, Mr Holmes, judging it by what we have heard.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22020' title='22020'>'Well, state your case, Mr Mac,' said Holmes, in his most judicial style.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22021' title='22021'>'The man is not a burglar, supposing that he ever existed. </span>
<span sid='22022' title='22022'>The ring business and the card point to premeditated murder for some private reason. </span>
<span sid='22023' title='22023'>Very good. </span>
<span sid='22024' title='22024'>Here is a man who slips into a house with the deliberate intention of committing murder. </span>
<span sid='22025' title='22025'>He knows, if he knows anything, that he will have a deeficulty in making his escape, as the house is surrounded with water. </span>
<span sid='22026' title='22026'>What weapon would he choose? </span>
<span sid='22027' title='22027'>You would say the most silent in the world. </span>
<span sid='22028' title='22028'>Then he could hope, when the deed was done, to slip quickly from the window, to wade the moat, and to get away at his leisure. </span>
<span sid='22029' title='22029'>That's understandable. </span>
<span sid='22030' title='22030'>But is it understandable that he should go out of his way to bring with him the most noisy weapon he could select, knowing well that it will fetch every human being in the house to the spot as quick as they can run, and that it is all odds that he will be seen before he can get across the moat? </span>
<span sid='22031' title='22031'>Is that credible, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22032' title='22032'>'Well, you put your case strongly,' my friend replied, thoughtfully. </span>
<span sid='22033' title='22033'>'It certainly needs a good deal of justification. </span>
<span sid='22034' title='22034'>May I ask, Mr White Mason, whether you examined the farther side of the moat at once, to see if there were any signs of the man having climbed out from the water?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22035' title='22035'>'There were no signs, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='22036' title='22036'>But it is a stone ledge, and one could hardly expect them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22037' title='22037'>'No tracks or marks?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22038' title='22038'>'None.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22039' title='22039'>'Ha! </span>
<span sid='22040' title='22040'>Would there be any objection, Mr White Mason, to our going down to the house at once? </span>
<span sid='22041' title='22041'>There may possibly be some small point which might be suggestive.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22042' title='22042'>'I was going to propose it, Mr Holmes, but I thought it well to put you in touch with all the facts before we go. </span>
<span sid='22043' title='22043'>I suppose, if anything should strike you - ' White Mason looked doubtfully at the amateur.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22044' title='22044'>'I have worked with Mr Holmes before,' said Inspector MacDonald. </span>
<span sid='22045' title='22045'>'He plays the game.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22046' title='22046'>'My own idea of the game, at any rate,' said Holmes, with a smile. </span>
<span sid='22047' title='22047'>'I go into a case to help the ends of justice and the work of the police. </span>
<span sid='22048' title='22048'>If ever I have separated myself from the official force, it is because they have first separated themselves from me. </span>
<span sid='22049' title='22049'>I have no wish ever to score at their expense. </span>
<span sid='22050' title='22050'>At the same time, Mr White Mason, I claim the right to work in my own way and give my results at my own time - complete, rather than in stages.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22051' title='22051'>'I am sure we are honoured by your presence and to show you all we know,' said White Mason, cordially. </span>
<span sid='22052' title='22052'>'Come along, Dr Watson, and when the time comes we'll all hope for a place in your book:</span>
<p>
<span sid='22053' title='22053'>We walked down the quaint village street with a row of pollarded elms on either side of it. </span>
<span sid='22054' title='22054'>Just beyond were two ancient stone pillars, weather-stained and lichen-blotched, bearing upon their summits a shapeless something which had once been the ramping lion of Capus of Birlstone. </span>
<span sid='22055' title='22055'>A short walk along the winding drive, with such sward and oaks around it as one only sees in rural <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>; then a sudden turn, and the long, low, Jacobean house of dingy, liver-coloured brick lay before us, with an old-fashioned garden of cut yews on either side of it. </span>
<span sid='22056' title='22056'>As we approached it there were the wooden drawbridge and the beautiful broad moat, as still and luminous as quicksilver in the cold winter sunshine. </span>
<span sid='22057' title='22057'>Three centuries had flowed past the old Manor House, centuries of births and home-comings, of country dances and of the meetings of fox-hunters. </span>
<span sid='22058' title='22058'>Strange that now in its old age this dark business should have cast its shadow upon the venerable walls. </span>
<span sid='22059' title='22059'>And yet those strange peaked roofs and quaint overhung gables were a fitting covering to grim and terrible intrigue. </span>
<span sid='22060' title='22060'>As I looked at the deep-set windows and the long sweep of the dull-coloured, water-lapped front I felt that no more fitting scene could be set for such a tragedy.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22061' title='22061'>'That's the window,' said White Mason: 'that one on the immediate right of the drawbridge. </span>
<span sid='22062' title='22062'>It's open just as it was found last night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22063' title='22063'>'It looks rather narrow for a man to pass.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22064' title='22064'>'Well, it wasn't a fat man, anyhow. </span>
<span sid='22065' title='22065'>We don't need your deductions, Mr Holmes, to tell us that. </span>
<span sid='22066' title='22066'>But you or I could squeeze through all right.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22067' title='22067'>Holmes walked to the edge of the moat and looked across. </span>
<span sid='22068' title='22068'>Then he examined the stone ledge and the grass border beyond it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22069' title='22069'>'I've had a good look, Mr Holmes,' said White Mason. </span>
<span sid='22070' title='22070'>'There is nothing there; no sign that anyone has landed. </span>
<span sid='22071' title='22071'>But why should he leave any sign?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22072' title='22072'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='22073' title='22073'>Why should he? </span>
<span sid='22074' title='22074'>Is the water always turbid?' </span>
<span sid='22075' title='22075'>'Generally about this colour. </span>
<span sid='22076' title='22076'>The stream brings down the clay.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22077' title='22077'>'How deep is it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22078' title='22078'>'About two feet at each side and three in the middle.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22079' title='22079'>'So we can put aside all idea of the man having been drowned in crossing?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22080' title='22080'>'No; a child could not be drowned in it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22081' title='22081'>We walked across the drawbridge, and were admitted by a quaint, gnarled, dried-up person who was the butler - Ames. </span>
<span sid='22082' title='22082'>The poor old fellow was white and quivering from the shock. </span>
<span sid='22083' title='22083'>The village sergeant, a tall, formal, melancholy man, still held his vigil in the room of fate. </span>
<span sid='22084' title='22084'>The doctor had departed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22085' title='22085'>'Anything fresh, Sergeant Wilson?' asked White Mason. </span>
<span sid='22086' title='22086'>'No, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22087' title='22087'>'Then you can go home. </span>
<span sid='22088' title='22088'>You've had enough. </span>
<span sid='22089' title='22089'>We can send for you if we want you. </span>
<span sid='22090' title='22090'>The butler had better wait outside. </span>
<span sid='22091' title='22091'>Tell him to warn Mr Cecil Barker, Mrs Douglas, and the housekeeper that we may want a word with them presently. </span>
<span sid='22092' title='22092'>Now, gentlemen, perhaps you will allow me to give you the views I have formed first, and then you will be able to arrive at your own.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22093' title='22093'>He impressed me, this country specialist. </span>
<span sid='22094' title='22094'>He had a solid grip of fact and a cool, clear, common-sense brain, which should take him some way in his profession. </span>
<span sid='22095' title='22095'>Holmes listened to him intently, with no sign of that impatience which the official exponent too often produced.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22096' title='22096'>'Is it suicide or is it murder - that's our first question, gentlemen, is it not? </span>
<span sid='22097' title='22097'>If it were suicide, then we have to believe that this man began by taking off his wedding-ring and concealing it; that he then came down here in his dressing-gown, trampled mud into a corner behind the curtain in order to give the idea someone had waited for him, opened the window, put the blood on the-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22098' title='22098'>'We can surely dismiss that,' said MacDonald.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22099' title='22099'>'So I think. </span>
<span sid='22100' title='22100'>Suicide is out of the question. </span>
<span sid='22101' title='22101'>Then a murder has been done. </span>
<span sid='22102' title='22102'>What we have to determine is whether it was done by someone outside or inside the house.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22103' title='22103'>'Well, let's hear the argument.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22104' title='22104'>'There are considerable difficulties both ways, and yet one or the other it must be. </span>
<span sid='22105' title='22105'>We will suppose first that some person or persons inside the house did the crime. </span>
<span sid='22106' title='22106'>They got this man down here at a time when everything was still, and yet no one was asleep. </span>
<span sid='22107' title='22107'>They then did the deed with the queerest and noisiest weapon in the world, so as to tell every one what had happened - a weapon that was never seen in the house before. </span>
<span sid='22108' title='22108'>That does not seem a very likely start, does it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22109' title='22109'>'No, it does not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22110' title='22110'>'Well, then, everyone is agreed that after the alarm was given only a minute at the most had passed before the whole household - not Mr Cecil Barker alone, though he claims to have been the first, but Ames and all of them - were on the spot. </span>
<span sid='22111' title='22111'>Do you tell me that in that time the guilty person managed to make footmarks in the corner, open the window, mark the sill with blood, take the wedding-ring off the dead man's finger, and all the rest of it? </span>
<span sid='22112' title='22112'>It's impossible!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22113' title='22113'>'You put it very clearly,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='22114' title='22114'>'I am inclined to agree with you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22115' title='22115'>'Well, then, we are driven back to the theory that it was done by someone from outside. </span>
<span sid='22116' title='22116'>We are still faced with some big difficulties, but, anyhow, they have ceased to be impossibilities. </span>
<span sid='22117' title='22117'>The man got into the house between four-thirty and six - that is to say, between dusk and the time when the bridge was raised. </span>
<span sid='22118' title='22118'>There had been some visitors, and the door was open, so there was nothing to prevent him. </span>
<span sid='22119' title='22119'>He may have been a common burglar, or he may have had some private grudge against Mr Douglas. </span>
<span sid='22120' title='22120'>Since Mr Douglas has spent most of his life in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>, and this shot-gun seems to be an <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n weapon, it would seem that the private grudge is the more likely theory. </span>
<span sid='22121' title='22121'>He slipped into this room because it was the first he came to, and he hid behind the curtain. </span>
<span sid='22122' title='22122'>There he remained until past eleven at night. </span>
<span sid='22123' title='22123'>At that time Mr Douglas entered the room. </span>
<span sid='22124' title='22124'>It was a short interview, if there were any interview at all, for Mrs Douglas declares that her husband had not left her more than a few minutes when she heard the shot.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22125' title='22125'>'The candle shows that,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22126' title='22126'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='22127' title='22127'>The candle, which was a new one, is not burned more than half an inch. </span>
<span sid='22128' title='22128'>He must have placed it on the table before he was attacked, otherwise, of course, it would have fallen when he fell. </span>
<span sid='22129' title='22129'>This shows that he was not attacked the instant that he entered the room. </span>
<span sid='22130' title='22130'>When Mr Barker arrived the lamp was lit and the candle put out.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22131' title='22131'>'That's all clear enough.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22132' title='22132'>'Well, now, we can reconstruct things on those lines. </span>
<span sid='22133' title='22133'>Mr Douglas enters the room. </span>
<span sid='22134' title='22134'>He puts down the candle. </span>
<span sid='22135' title='22135'>A man appears from behind the curtain. </span>
<span sid='22136' title='22136'>He is armed with this gun. </span>
<span sid='22137' title='22137'>He demands the wedding-ring - Heaven only knows why, hut so it must have been. </span>
<span sid='22138' title='22138'>Mr Douglas gave it up. </span>
<span sid='22139' title='22139'>Then either in cold blood or in the course of a struggle - Douglas may have gripped the hammer that was found upon the mat - he shot Douglas in this horrible way. </span>
<span sid='22140' title='22140'>He dropped his gun and also, it would seem, this queer card, "V.V. 341", whatever that may mean, and he made his escape through the window and across the moat at the very moment when Cecil Barker was discovering the crime. </span>
<span sid='22141' title='22141'>How's that, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22142' title='22142'>'Very interesting, but just a little unconvincing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22143' title='22143'>'Man, it would be absolute nonsense if it wasn't that anything else is even worse,' cried MacDonald. </span>
<span sid='22144' title='22144'>'Somebody killed the man, and whoever it was I could clearly prove to you that he should have done it some other way. </span>
<span sid='22145' title='22145'>What does he mean by allowing his retreat to be cut off like that? </span>
<span sid='22146' title='22146'>What does he mean by using a shot-gun when silence was his one chance of escape? </span>
<span sid='22147' title='22147'>Come, Mr Holmes, it's up to you to give us a lead, since you say Mr White Mason's theory is unconvincing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22148' title='22148'>Holmes had sat intently observant during this long discussion, missing no word that was said, with his keen eyes darting to right and to left, and his forehead wrinkled with speculation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22149' title='22149'>'I should like a few more facts before I get so far as a theory, Mr Mac,' said he, kneeling down beside the body. </span>
<span sid='22150' title='22150'>'Dear me! these injuries are really appalling. </span>
<span sid='22151' title='22151'>Can we have he butler in for a moment? ... </span>
<span sid='22152' title='22152'>Ames, I understand that you have often seen this very unusual mark, a branded triangle inside a circle, upon Mr Douglas's forearm?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22153' title='22153'>'Frequently, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22154' title='22154'>'You never heard any speculation as to what it meant?' </span>
<span sid='22155' title='22155'>'No, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22156' title='22156'>It must have caused great pain when it was inflicted. </span>
<span sid='22157' title='22157'>It is undoubtedly a burn. </span>
<span sid='22158' title='22158'>Now, I observe, Ames, that there is a small piece of plaster at the angle of Mr Douglas's jaw. </span>
<span sid='22159' title='22159'>Did you observe that in life?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22160' title='22160'>'Yes, sir; he cut himself in shaving yesterday morning.' </span>
<span sid='22161' title='22161'>'Did you ever know him cut himself in shaving before?' </span>
<span sid='22162' title='22162'>'Not for a very long time, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22163' title='22163'>'Suggestive!' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='22164' title='22164'>'It may, of course, be a mere coincidence, or it may point to some nervousness which would indicate that he had reason to apprehend danger. </span>
<span sid='22165' title='22165'>Had you noticed anything unusual in his conduct yesterday, Ames?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22166' title='22166'>'It struck me that he was a little restless and excited, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22167' title='22167'>'Hal The attack may not have been entirely unexpected. </span>
<span sid='22168' title='22168'>We do seem to make a little progress, do we not? </span>
<span sid='22169' title='22169'>Perhaps you would rather do the questioning, Mr Mac?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22170' title='22170'>'No, Mr Holmes; it's in better hands.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22171' title='22171'>'Well, then, we will pass to this card - "V.V. 341". </span>
<span sid='22172' title='22172'>It is rough cardboard. </span>
<span sid='22173' title='22173'>Have you any of the sort in the house?' </span>
<span sid='22174' title='22174'>'I don't think so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22175' title='22175'>Holmes walked across to the desk and dabbed a little ink from each bottle on to the blotting-paper. </span>
<span sid='22176' title='22176'>'It has not been printed in this room,' he said; 'this is black ink, and the other purplish. </span>
<span sid='22177' title='22177'>It has been done by a thick pen, and these are fine. </span>
<span sid='22178' title='22178'>No, it has been done elsewhere, I should say. </span>
<span sid='22179' title='22179'>Can you make anything of the inscription, Ames?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22180' title='22180'>'No, sir, nothing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22181' title='22181'>'What do you think, Mr Mac?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22182' title='22182'>'It gives me the impression of a secret society of some sort. </span>
<span sid='22183' title='22183'>The same with this badge upon the forearm.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22184' title='22184'>'That's my idea, too,' said White Mason.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22185' title='22185'>'Well, we can adopt it as a working hypothesis, and then see how far our difficulties disappear. </span>
<span sid='22186' title='22186'>An agent from such a society makes his way into the house, waits for Mr Douglas, blows his head nearly off with this weapon, and escapes by wading the moat, after leaving a card beside the dead man which will, when mentioned in the papers, tell other members of the society that vengeance has been done. </span>
<span sid='22187' title='22187'>That all hangs together. </span>
<span sid='22188' title='22188'>But why this gun, of all weapons?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22189' title='22189'>'Exactly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22190' title='22190'>'And why the missing ring?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22191' title='22191'>'Quite so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22192' title='22192'>'And why no arrest? </span>
<span sid='22193' title='22193'>It's past two now. </span>
<span sid='22194' title='22194'>I take it for granted that since dawn every constable within forty miles has been looking out for a wet stranger?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22195' title='22195'>'That is so, Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22196' title='22196'>'Well, unless he has a burrow close by, or a change of clothes ready, they can hardly miss him. </span>
<span sid='22197' title='22197'>And yet they have missed him up to now.' </span>
<span sid='22198' title='22198'>Holmes had gone to the window and was examining with his lens the blood-mark upon the sill. </span>
<span sid='22199' title='22199'>It is clearly the tread of a shoe. </span>
<span sid='22200' title='22200'>It is remarkably broad - a splay foot, one would say. </span>
<span sid='22201' title='22201'>Curious, because, so far as one can trace any footmark in this mud-stained corner, one would say it was a more shapely sole. </span>
<span sid='22202' title='22202'>However, they are certainly very indistinct. </span>
<span sid='22203' title='22203'>What's this under the side-table?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22204' title='22204'>'Mr Douglas's dumb-bells,' said Ames.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22205' title='22205'>'Dumb-bell - there's only one. </span>
<span sid='22206' title='22206'>Where's the other?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22207' title='22207'>'I don't know, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='22208' title='22208'>There may have been only one. </span>
<span sid='22209' title='22209'>I have not noticed them for months.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22210' title='22210'>'One dumb-bell-' Holmes said, seriously, but his remarks were interrupted by a sharp knock at the door. </span>
<span sid='22211' title='22211'>A tall, sunburned, capable-looking, clean-shaven man looked in at us. </span>
<span sid='22212' title='22212'>I had no difficulty in guessing that it was the Cecil Barker of whom I had heard. </span>
<span sid='22213' title='22213'>His masterful eyes travelled quickly with a questioning glance from face to face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22214' title='22214'>'Sorry to interrupt your consultation,' said he, 'but you should hear the latest.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22215' title='22215'>'An arrest?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22216' title='22216'>'No such luck. </span>
<span sid='22217' title='22217'>But they've found his bicycle. </span>
<span sid='22218' title='22218'>The fellow left his bicycle behind him. </span>
<span sid='22219' title='22219'>Come and have a look. </span>
<span sid='22220' title='22220'>It is within a hundred yards of the hall door.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22221' title='22221'>We found three or four grooms and idlers standing in the drive inspecting a bicycle which had been drawn out from a clump of evergreens in which it had been concealed. </span>
<span sid='22222' title='22222'>It was a well-used Rudge-Whitworth, splashed as from a considerable journey. </span>
<span sid='22223' title='22223'>There was a saddle-bag with spanner and oil-can, but no clue as to the owner.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22224' title='22224'>'It would be a grand help to the police,' said the inspector, 'if these things were numbered and registered. </span>
<span sid='22225' title='22225'>But we must be thankful for what we've got. </span>
<span sid='22226' title='22226'>If we can't find where he went to, at least we are likely to get where he came from. </span>
<span sid='22227' title='22227'>But what in the name of all that is wonderful made the fellow leave it behind? </span>
<span sid='22228' title='22228'>And how in the world has he got away without it? </span>
<span sid='22229' title='22229'>We don't seem to get a gleam of light in the case, Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22230' title='22230'>'Don't we?' my friend answered, thoughtfully. </span>
<span sid='22231' title='22231'>'I wonder!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22232' title='22232'>CHAPTER 5 : The People of the Drama</span>
<p>
<span sid='22233' title='22233'>'Have you seen all you want of the study?' asked White Mason as we re-entered the house.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22234' title='22234'>'For the time,' said the inspector; and Holmes nodded.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22235' title='22235'>'Then perhaps you would now like to hear the evidence of some of the people in the house? </span>
<span sid='22236' title='22236'>We could use the dining-room, Ames. </span>
<span sid='22237' title='22237'>Please come yourself first and tell us what you know.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22238' title='22238'>The butler's account was a simple and a clear one, and he gave a convincing impression of sincerity. </span>
<span sid='22239' title='22239'>He had been engaged five years ago when Mr Douglas first came to Birlstone. </span>
<span sid='22240' title='22240'>He understood that Mr Douglas was a rich gentleman who had made his money in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>. </span>
<span sid='22241' title='22241'>He had been a kind and considerate employer - not quite what Ames was used to, perhaps, but one can't have everything. </span>
<span sid='22242' title='22242'>He never saw any signs of apprehension in Mr Douglas - on the contrary, he was the most fearless man he had ever known. </span>
<span sid='22243' title='22243'>He ordered the drawbridge to be pulled up every night because it was the ancient custom of the old house, and he liked to keep the old ways up. </span>
<span sid='22244' title='22244'>Mr Douglas seldom went to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> or left the village, but on the day before the crime he had been shopping at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Tunbridge Wells&t=h'>Tunbridge Wells</a>. </span>
<span sid='22245' title='22245'>He, Ames, had observed some restlessness and excitement on the part of Mr Douglas upon that day, for he had seemed impatient and irritable, which was unusual with him. </span>
<span sid='22246' title='22246'>He had not gone to bed that night, but was in the pantry at the back of the house, putting away the silver, when he heard the bell ring violently. </span>
<span sid='22247' title='22247'>He heard no shot, but it was hardly possible he should, as the pantry and kitchens were at the very back of the house and there were several closed doors and a long passage between. </span>
<span sid='22248' title='22248'>The housekeeper had come out of her room, attracted by the violent ringing of the bell. </span>
<span sid='22249' title='22249'>They had gone to the front of the house together. </span>
<span sid='22250' title='22250'>As they reached the bottom of the stair he had seen Mrs Douglas coming down it. </span>
<span sid='22251' title='22251'>No, she was not hurrying - it did not seem to him that she was particularly agitated. </span>
<span sid='22252' title='22252'>Just as she reached the bottom of the stair Mr Barker had rushed out of the study. </span>
<span sid='22253' title='22253'>He had stopped Mrs Douglas and begged her to go back.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22254' title='22254'>'For God's sake, go back to your room!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='22255' title='22255'>'Poor Jack is dead. </span>
<span sid='22256' title='22256'>You can do nothing. </span>
<span sid='22257' title='22257'>For God's sake, go back!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22258' title='22258'>After some persuasion upon the stairs Mrs Douglas had gone back. </span>
<span sid='22259' title='22259'>She did not scream. </span>
<span sid='22260' title='22260'>She made no outcry whatever. </span>
<span sid='22261' title='22261'>Mrs Allen, the housekeeper, had taken her upstairs and stayed with her in the bedroom. </span>
<span sid='22262' title='22262'>Ames and Mr Barker had then returned to the study, where they had found everything exactly as the police had seen it. </span>
<span sid='22263' title='22263'>The candle was not lit at that time, but the lamp was burning. </span>
<span sid='22264' title='22264'>They had looked out of the window, but the night was very dark and nothing could be seen or heard. </span>
<span sid='22265' title='22265'>They had then rushed out into the hall, where Ames had turned the windlass which had lowered the drawbridge. </span>
<span sid='22266' title='22266'>Mr Barker had then hurried off to get the police.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22267' title='22267'>Such, in its essentials, was the evidence of the butler.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22268' title='22268'>The account of Mrs Allen, the housekeeper, was, so far as it went, a corroboration of that of her fellow-servant. </span>
<span sid='22269' title='22269'>The housekeeper's room was rather nearer to the front of the house than the pantry in which Ames had been working. </span>
<span sid='22270' title='22270'>She was preparing to go to bed when the loud ringing of the bell had attracted her attention. </span>
<span sid='22271' title='22271'>She was a little hard of hearing. </span>
<span sid='22272' title='22272'>Perhaps that was why she had not heard the sound of the shot, but in any case the study was a long way off.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22273' title='22273'>She remembered hearing some sound which she imagined to be the slamming of a door. </span>
<span sid='22274' title='22274'>That was a good deal earlier - half an hour at least before the ringing of the bell. </span>
<span sid='22275' title='22275'>When Mr Ames ran to the front she went with him. </span>
<span sid='22276' title='22276'>She saw Mr Barker, very pale and excited, come out of the study. </span>
<span sid='22277' title='22277'>He intercepted Mrs Douglas, who was coming down the stairs. </span>
<span sid='22278' title='22278'>He entreated her to go back, and she answered him, but what she said could not be heard.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22279' title='22279'>'Take her up. </span>
<span sid='22280' title='22280'>Stay with her!' he had said to Mrs Allen.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22281' title='22281'>She had therefore taken her to the bedroom and endeavoured to soothe her. </span>
<span sid='22282' title='22282'>She was greatly excited, trembling all over, but made no other attempt to go downstairs. </span>
<span sid='22283' title='22283'>She just sat in her dressing-gown by her bedroom fire with her head sunk in her hands. </span>
<span sid='22284' title='22284'>Mrs Allen stayed with her most of the night. </span>
<span sid='22285' title='22285'>As to the other servants, they had all gone to bed, and the alarm did not reach them until just before the police arrived. </span>
<span sid='22286' title='22286'>They slept at the extreme back of the house, and could not possibly have heard anything.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22287' title='22287'>So far the housekeeper - who could add nothing on cross-examination save lamentations and expressions of amazement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22288' title='22288'>Mr Cecil Barker succeeded Mrs Allen as a witness. </span>
<span sid='22289' title='22289'>As to the occurrences of the night before, he had very little to add to what he had already told the police. </span>
<span sid='22290' title='22290'>Personally, he was convinced that the murderer had escaped by the window. </span>
<span sid='22291' title='22291'>The blood-stain was conclusive, in his opinion, upon that point. </span>
<span sid='22292' title='22292'>Besides, as the bridge was up there was no other possible way of escaping. </span>
<span sid='22293' title='22293'>He could not explain what had become of the assassin, or why he had not taken his bicycle, if it were indeed his. </span>
<span sid='22294' title='22294'>He could not possibly have been drowned in the moat, which was at no place more than three feet deep.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22295' title='22295'>In his own mind he had a very definite theory about the murder. </span>
<span sid='22296' title='22296'>Douglas was a reticent man, and there were some chapters in his life of which he never spoke. </span>
<span sid='22297' title='22297'>He had emigrated to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a> from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ireland&t=h'>Ireland</a> when he was a very young man. </span>
<span sid='22298' title='22298'>He had prospered well, and Barker had first met him in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=California&t=h'>California</a>, where they had become partners in a success-fill mining claim at a place called Benito Canyon. </span>
<span sid='22299' title='22299'>They had done very well, but Douglas had suddenly sold out and started for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>. </span>
<span sid='22300' title='22300'>He was a widower at that time. </span>
<span sid='22301' title='22301'>Barker had afterwards realized his money and come to live in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='22302' title='22302'>Thus they had renewed their friendship. </span>
<span sid='22303' title='22303'>Douglas had given him the impression that some danger was hanging over his head, and he had always looked upon his sudden departure from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=California&t=h'>California</a>, and also his renting a house in so quiet a place in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, as being connected with this peril. </span>
<span sid='22304' title='22304'>He imagined that some secret society, some implacable organization, was on Douglas's track which would never rest until it killed him. </span>
<span sid='22305' title='22305'>Some remarks of his had given him this idea, though he had never told him what the society was, nor how he had come to offend it. </span>
<span sid='22306' title='22306'>He could only suppose that the legend upon the placard had some reference to this secret society.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22307' title='22307'>'How long were you with Douglas in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=California&t=h'>California</a>?' asked Inspector MacDonald.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22308' title='22308'>'Five years altogether.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22309' title='22309'>'He was a bachelor, you say?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22310' title='22310'>'A widower.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22311' title='22311'>'Have you ever heard where his first wife came from?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22312' title='22312'>'No; I remember his saying that she was of German extraction, and I have seen her portrait. </span>
<span sid='22313' title='22313'>She was a very beautiful woman. </span>
<span sid='22314' title='22314'>She died of typhoid the year before I met him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22315' title='22315'>'You don't associate his past with any particular part of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22316' title='22316'>'I have heard him talk of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>. </span>
<span sid='22317' title='22317'>He knew that city well And had worked there. </span>
<span sid='22318' title='22318'>I have heard him talk of the coal and iron districts. </span>
<span sid='22319' title='22319'>He had travelled a good deal in his time.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22320' title='22320'>'Was he a politician? </span>
<span sid='22321' title='22321'>Had this secret society to do with politics?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22322' title='22322'>'No; he cared nothing about politics.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22323' title='22323'>'You have no reason to think it was criminal?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22324' title='22324'>'On the contrary, I never met a straighter man in my life.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22325' title='22325'>'Was there anything curious about his life in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=California&t=h'>California</a>?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22326' title='22326'>'He liked best to stay and to work at our claim in the mountains. </span>
<span sid='22327' title='22327'>He would never go where other men were if he could help it. </span>
<span sid='22328' title='22328'>That's why I first thought that someone was after him. </span>
<span sid='22329' title='22329'>Then when he left so suddenly for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a> I made sure that it was so. </span>
<span sid='22330' title='22330'>I believe that he had a warning of some sort. </span>
<span sid='22331' title='22331'>Within a week of his leaving half-a-dozen men were inquiring for him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22332' title='22332'>'What sort of men?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22333' title='22333'>'Well, they were a mighty hard-looking crowd. </span>
<span sid='22334' title='22334'>They came up to the claim and wanted to know where he was. </span>
<span sid='22335' title='22335'>I told them that he was gone to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a> and that I did not know where to find him. </span>
<span sid='22336' title='22336'>They meant him no good - it was easy to see that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22337' title='22337'>'Were these men <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>ns - <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=California&t=h'>California</a>ns?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22338' title='22338'>'Well, I don't know about <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=California&t=h'>California</a>ns. </span>
<span sid='22339' title='22339'>They were <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>ns all right. </span>
<span sid='22340' title='22340'>But they were not miners. </span>
<span sid='22341' title='22341'>I don't know what they were, and was very glad to see their backs.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22342' title='22342'>'That was six years ago?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22343' title='22343'>'Nearer seven.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22344' title='22344'>'And then you were together five years in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=California&t=h'>California</a>, so that this business dates back not less than eleven years at the least?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22345' title='22345'>'That is so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22346' title='22346'>'It must be a very serious feud that would be kept up with such earnestness for as long as that. </span>
<span sid='22347' title='22347'>It would be no light thing that would give rise to it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22348' title='22348'>'I think it shadowed his whole life. </span>
<span sid='22349' title='22349'>It was never quite out of his mind.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22350' title='22350'>'But if a man had a danger hanging over him, and knew what it was, don't you think he would turn to the police for protection?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22351' title='22351'>'Maybe it was some danger that he could not be protected against. </span>
<span sid='22352' title='22352'>There's one thing you should know. </span>
<span sid='22353' title='22353'>He always went about armed. </span>
<span sid='22354' title='22354'>His revolver was never out of his pocket. </span>
<span sid='22355' title='22355'>But, by bad luck, he was in his dressing-gown and had left it in the bedroom last night. </span>
<span sid='22356' title='22356'>Once the bridge was up I guess he thought he was safe.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22357' title='22357'>'I should like these dates a little clearer,' said MacDonald. </span>
<span sid='22358' title='22358'>'It is quite six years since Douglas left <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=California&t=h'>California</a>. </span>
<span sid='22359' title='22359'>You followed him next year, did you not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22360' title='22360'>'That is so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22361' title='22361'>'And he has been married for five years. </span>
<span sid='22362' title='22362'>You must have returned about the time of his marriage.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22363' title='22363'>'About a month before. </span>
<span sid='22364' title='22364'>I was his best man.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22365' title='22365'>'Did you know Mrs Douglas before her marriage?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22366' title='22366'>'No, I did not. </span>
<span sid='22367' title='22367'>I had been away from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> for ten years.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22368' title='22368'>'But you have seen a good deal of her since?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22369' title='22369'>Barker looked sternly at the detective.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22370' title='22370'>'I have seen a good deal of him since,' he answered. </span>
<span sid='22371' title='22371'>'If I have seen her, it is because you cannot visit a man without knowing his wife. </span>
<span sid='22372' title='22372'>If you imagine there is any connection-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22373' title='22373'>'I imagine nothing, Mr Barker. </span>
<span sid='22374' title='22374'>I am bound to make every inquiry which can bear upon the case. </span>
<span sid='22375' title='22375'>But I mean no offence.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22376' title='22376'>'Some inquiries are offensive,' Barker answered, angrily.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22377' title='22377'>'It's only the facts that we want. </span>
<span sid='22378' title='22378'>It is in your interest and everyone's interests that they should be cleared up. </span>
<span sid='22379' title='22379'>Did Mr Douglas entirely approve your friendship with his wife?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22380' title='22380'>Barker grew paler, and his great strong hands were clasped convulsively together.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22381' title='22381'>'You have no right to ask such questions!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='22382' title='22382'>'What has this to do with the matter you are investigating?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22383' title='22383'>'I must repeat the question.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22384' title='22384'>'Well, I refuse to answer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22385' title='22385'>'You can refuse to answer, but you must be aware that your refusal is in itself an answer, for you would not refuse if you had not something to conceal.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22386' title='22386'>Barker stood for a moment, with his face set grimly and his strong black eyebrows drawn low in intense thought. </span>
<span sid='22387' title='22387'>Then he looked up with a smile.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22388' title='22388'>'Well, I guess you gentlemen are only doing your clear duty, after all, and that I have no right to stand in the way of it. </span>
<span sid='22389' title='22389'>I'd only ask you not to worry Mrs Douglas over this matter, for she has enough upon her just now. </span>
<span sid='22390' title='22390'>I may tell you that poor Douglas had just one fault in the world, and that was his jealousy. </span>
<span sid='22391' title='22391'>He was fond of me - no man could be fonder of a friend. </span>
<span sid='22392' title='22392'>And he was devoted to his wife. </span>
<span sid='22393' title='22393'>He loved me to come here and was for ever sending for me. </span>
<span sid='22394' title='22394'>And yet if his wife and I talked together or there seemed any sympathy between us, a kind of wave of jealousy would pass over him and he would be off the handle and saying the wildest things in a moment. </span>
<span sid='22395' title='22395'>More than once I've sworn off coming for that reason, and then he would write me such penitent, imploring letters that I just had to. </span>
<span sid='22396' title='22396'>But you can take it from me, gentlemen, if it was my last word, that no man ever had a more loving, faithful wife - and I can say, also, no friend could be more loyal than I.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22397' title='22397'>It was spoken with fervour and feeling, and yet Inspector MacDonald could not dismiss the subject.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22398' title='22398'>'You are aware,' said he, 'that the dead man's wedding-ring has been taken from his finger?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22399' title='22399'>'So it appears,' said Barker.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22400' title='22400'>'What do you mean by "appears"? </span>
<span sid='22401' title='22401'>You know it as a fact.' </span>
<span sid='22402' title='22402'>The man seemed confused and undecided.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22403' title='22403'>'When I said "appears", I meant that it was conceivable that he had himself taken off the ring.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22404' title='22404'>'The mere fact that the ring should be absent, whoever may have removed it, would suggest to anyone's mind, would it not, that the marriage and the tragedy were connected?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22405' title='22405'>Barker shrugged his broad shoulders.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22406' title='22406'>'I can't profess to say what it suggests,' he answered. </span>
<span sid='22407' title='22407'>'But if you mean to hint that it could reflect in any way upon this lady's honour' - his eyes blazed for an instant, and then with an evident effort he got a grip upon his own emotions - 'well, you are on the wrong track, that's all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22408' title='22408'>'I don't know that I've anything else to ask you at present,' said MacDonald, coldly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22409' title='22409'>'There was one small point,' remarked Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='22410' title='22410'>'When you entered the room there was only a candle lighted upon the table, was there not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22411' title='22411'>'Yes, that was so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22412' title='22412'>'By its light you saw that some terrible incident had occurred?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22413' title='22413'>'Exactly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22414' title='22414'>'You at once rang for help?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22415' title='22415'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22416' title='22416'>'And it arrived very speedily?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22417' title='22417'>'Within a minute or so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22418' title='22418'>'And yet when they arrived they found that the candle was out and that the lamp had been lighted. </span>
<span sid='22419' title='22419'>That seems very remarkable.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22420' title='22420'>Again Barker showed some signs of indecision.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22421' title='22421'>'I don't see that it was remarkable, Mr Holmes,' he answered, after a pause. </span>
<span sid='22422' title='22422'>'The candle threw a very bad light. </span>
<span sid='22423' title='22423'>My first thought was to get a better one. </span>
<span sid='22424' title='22424'>The lamp was on the table, so I lit it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22425' title='22425'>'And blew out the candle?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22426' title='22426'>'Exactly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22427' title='22427'>Holmes asked no further question, and Barker, with a deliberate look from one to the other of us, which had, as it seemed to me, something of defiance in it, turned and left the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22428' title='22428'>Inspector MacDonald had sent up a note to the effect that he would wait upon Mrs Douglas in her room, but she had replied that she would meet us in the dining-room. </span>
<span sid='22429' title='22429'>She entered now, a tall and beautiful woman of thirty, reserved and self-possessed to a remarkable degree, very different from the tragic and distracted figure that I had pictured. </span>
<span sid='22430' title='22430'>It is true that her face was pale and drawn, like that of one who has endured a great shock, but her manner was composed, and the finely-moulded hand which she rested upon the edge of the table was as steady as my own. </span>
<span sid='22431' title='22431'>Her sad, appealing eyes travelled from one to the other of us with a curiously inquisitive expression. </span>
<span sid='22432' title='22432'>That questioning gaze transformed itself suddenly into abrupt speech.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22433' title='22433'>'Have you found out anything yet?' she asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22434' title='22434'>Was it my imagination that there was an undertone of fear rather than of hope in the question?</span>
<p>
<span sid='22435' title='22435'>'We have taken every possible step, Mrs Douglas,' said the inspector. </span>
<span sid='22436' title='22436'>'You may rest assured that nothing will be neglected.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22437' title='22437'>'Spare no money,' she said, in a dead, even tone. </span>
<span sid='22438' title='22438'>'It is my desire that every possible effort should be made.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22439' title='22439'>'Perhaps you can tell us something which may throw some light upon the matter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22440' title='22440'>'I fear not, but all I know is at your service.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22441' title='22441'>'We have heard from Mr Cecil Barker that you did not actually see - that you were never in the room where the tragedy occurred?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22442' title='22442'>'No; he turned me back upon the stairs. </span>
<span sid='22443' title='22443'>He begged me to return to my room.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22444' title='22444'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='22445' title='22445'>You had heard the shot and you had at once come down.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22446' title='22446'>'I put on my dressing-gown and then came down.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22447' title='22447'>'How long was it after hearing the shot that you were stopped on the stair by Mr Barker?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22448' title='22448'>'It may have been a couple of minutes. </span>
<span sid='22449' title='22449'>It is so hard to reckon time at such a moment. </span>
<span sid='22450' title='22450'>He implored me not to go on. </span>
<span sid='22451' title='22451'>He assured me that I could do nothing. </span>
<span sid='22452' title='22452'>Then Mrs Allen, the housekeeper, led me upstairs again. </span>
<span sid='22453' title='22453'>It was all like some dreadful dream.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22454' title='22454'>'Can you give us any idea how long your husband had been downstairs before you heard the shot?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22455' title='22455'>'No, I cannot say. </span>
<span sid='22456' title='22456'>He went from his dressing-room and I did not hear him go. </span>
<span sid='22457' title='22457'>He did the round of the house every night, for he was nervous of fire. </span>
<span sid='22458' title='22458'>It is the only thing that I have ever known him nervous of.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22459' title='22459'>'That is just the point which I want to come to, Mrs Douglas. </span>
<span sid='22460' title='22460'>You have only known your husband in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, have you not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22461' title='22461'>'Yes. </span>
<span sid='22462' title='22462'>We have been married five years.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22463' title='22463'>'Have you heard him speak of anything which occurred in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a> and which might bring some danger upon him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22464' title='22464'>Mrs Douglas thought earnestly before she answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22465' title='22465'>'Yes,' she said at last. </span>
<span sid='22466' title='22466'>'I have always felt that there was a danger hanging over him. </span>
<span sid='22467' title='22467'>He refused to discuss it with me. </span>
<span sid='22468' title='22468'>It was not from want of confidence in me - there was the most complete love and confidence between us - but it was out of his desire to keep all alarm away from me. </span>
<span sid='22469' title='22469'>He thought I should brood over it if I knew all, and so he was silent.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22470' title='22470'>'How did you know it, then?' Mrs Douglas's face lit with a quick smile.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22471' title='22471'>'Can a husband ever carry about a secret all his life and a woman who loves him have no suspicion of it? </span>
<span sid='22472' title='22472'>I knew it in many ways. </span>
<span sid='22473' title='22473'>I knew it by his refusal to talk about some episodes in his <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n life. </span>
<span sid='22474' title='22474'>I knew it by certain precautions he took. </span>
<span sid='22475' title='22475'>I knew it by certain words he let fall. </span>
<span sid='22476' title='22476'>I knew it by the way he looked at unexpected strangers. </span>
<span sid='22477' title='22477'>I was perfectly certain that he had some powerful enemies, that he believed they were on his track and that he was always on his guard against them. </span>
<span sid='22478' title='22478'>I was so sure of it that for years I have been terrified if ever he came home later than was expected.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22479' title='22479'>'Might I ask', said Holmes, 'what the words were which attracted your attention?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22480' title='22480'>'"The Valley of Fear,"' the lady answered. </span>
<span sid='22481' title='22481'>'That was an expression he has used when I questioned him. </span>
<span sid='22482' title='22482'>"I have been in the Valley of Fear. </span>
<span sid='22483' title='22483'>I am not out of it yet." </span>
<span sid='22484' title='22484'>"Are we never to get out of the Valley of Fear?" I have asked him, when I have seen him more serious than usual. </span>
<span sid='22485' title='22485'>"Sometimes I think that we never shall," he has answered.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22486' title='22486'>'Surely you asked him what he meant by the Valley of Fear?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22487' title='22487'>'I did; but his face would become very grave and he would shake his head. </span>
<span sid='22488' title='22488'>"It is bad enough that one of us should have been in its shadow," he said. </span>
<span sid='22489' title='22489'>"Please God it shall never fall upon you." </span>
<span sid='22490' title='22490'>It was some real valley in which he had lived and in which something terrible had occurred to him - of that I am certain - but I can tell you no more.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22491' title='22491'>'And he never mentioned any names?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22492' title='22492'>'Yes; he was delirious with fever once when he had his hunting accident three years ago. </span>
<span sid='22493' title='22493'>Then I remember that there was a name that came continually to his lips. </span>
<span sid='22494' title='22494'>He spoke it with anger and a sort of horror. </span>
<span sid='22495' title='22495'>McGinty was the name Bodymaster McGinty. </span>
<span sid='22496' title='22496'>I asked him, when he recovered, who Bodymaster McGinty was, and whose body he was master of. </span>
<span sid='22497' title='22497'>"Never of mine, thank God!" he answered, with a laugh, and that was all I could get from him. </span>
<span sid='22498' title='22498'>But there is a connection between Bodymaster McGinty and the Valley of Fear.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22499' title='22499'>'There is one other point,' said Inspector MacDonald. </span>
<span sid='22500' title='22500'>'You met Mr Douglas in a boarding-house in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, did you not, and became engaged to him there? </span>
<span sid='22501' title='22501'>Was there any romance, anything secret or mysterious, about the wedding?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22502' title='22502'>'There was romance. </span>
<span sid='22503' title='22503'>There is always romance. </span>
<span sid='22504' title='22504'>There was nothing mysterious.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22505' title='22505'>'He had no rival?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22506' title='22506'>'No; I was quite free.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22507' title='22507'>'You have heard, no doubt, that his wedding-ring has been taken. </span>
<span sid='22508' title='22508'>Does that suggest anything to you? </span>
<span sid='22509' title='22509'>Suppose that some enemy of his old life had tracked him down and committed this crime, what possible reason could he have for taking his wedding-ring?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22510' title='22510'>For an instant I could have sworn that the faintest shadow of a smile flickered over the woman's lips.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22511' title='22511'>'I really cannot tell,' she answered. </span>
<span sid='22512' title='22512'>'It is certainly a most extraordinary thing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22513' title='22513'>'Well, we will not detain you any longer, and we are sorry to have put you to this trouble at such a time,' said the inspector. </span>
<span sid='22514' title='22514'>'There are some other points, no doubt, but we can refer to you as they arise.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22515' title='22515'>She rose, and I was again conscious of that quick, questioning glance with which she had just surveyed us: </span>
<span sid='22516' title='22516'>'What impression has my evidence made upon you?' </span>
<span sid='22517' title='22517'>The question might as well have been spoken. </span>
<span sid='22518' title='22518'>Then, with a bow, she swept from the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22519' title='22519'>'She's a beautiful woman - a very beautiful woman,' said MacDonald, thoughtfully, after the door had closed behind her. </span>
<span sid='22520' title='22520'>'This man Barker has certainly been down here a good deal. </span>
<span sid='22521' title='22521'>He is a man who might be attractive to a woman. </span>
<span sid='22522' title='22522'>He admits that the dead man was jealous, and maybe he knew best himself what cause he had for jealousy. </span>
<span sid='22523' title='22523'>Then there's that wedding-ring. </span>
<span sid='22524' title='22524'>You can't get past that. </span>
<span sid='22525' title='22525'>The man who tears a wedding-ring off a dead man's - What do you say to it, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22526' title='22526'>My friend had sat with his head upon his hands, sunk in the deepest thought. </span>
<span sid='22527' title='22527'>Now he rose and rang the bell.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22528' title='22528'>'Ames,' he said, when the butler entered, 'where is Mr Cecil Barker now?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22529' title='22529'>'I'll see, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22530' title='22530'>He came back in a moment to say that Mr Barker was in the garden.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22531' title='22531'>'Can you remember, Ames, what Mr Barker had upon his feet last night when you joined him in the study?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22532' title='22532'>'Yes, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='22533' title='22533'>He had a pair of bedroom slippers. </span>
<span sid='22534' title='22534'>I brought him his boots when he went for the police.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22535' title='22535'>'Where are the slippers now?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22536' title='22536'>'They are still under the chair in the hall.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22537' title='22537'>'Very good, Ames. </span>
<span sid='22538' title='22538'>It is, of course, important for us to know which tracks may be Mr Barker's and which from outside.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22539' title='22539'>'Yes, sir. </span>
<span sid='22540' title='22540'>I may say that I noticed that the slippers were stained with blood - so, indeed, were my own.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22541' title='22541'>'That is natural enough, considering the condition of the room. </span>
<span sid='22542' title='22542'>Very good, Ames. </span>
<span sid='22543' title='22543'>We will ring if we want you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22544' title='22544'>A few minutes later we were in the study. </span>
<span sid='22545' title='22545'>Holmes had brought with him the carpet slippers from the hall. </span>
<span sid='22546' title='22546'>As Ames had observed, the soles of both were dark with blood.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22547' title='22547'>'Strange!' murmured Holmes, as he stood in the light of the window and examined them minutely. </span>
<span sid='22548' title='22548'>'Very strange indeed!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22549' title='22549'>Stooping with one of his quick, feline pounces he placed the slipper upon the blood-mark on the sill. </span>
<span sid='22550' title='22550'>It exactly corresponded. </span>
<span sid='22551' title='22551'>He smiled in silence at his colleagues.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22552' title='22552'>The inspector was transfigured with excitement. </span>
<span sid='22553' title='22553'>His native accent rattled like a stick upon railings.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22554' title='22554'>'Man!' he cried, 'there's not a doubt of it! </span>
<span sid='22555' title='22555'>Barker has just marked the window himself. </span>
<span sid='22556' title='22556'>It's a good deal broader than any boot-mark. </span>
<span sid='22557' title='22557'>I mind that you said it was a splay foot, and here's the explanation. </span>
<span sid='22558' title='22558'>But what's the game, Mr Holmes - what's the game?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22559' title='22559'>'Aye, what's the game?' my friend repeated, thoughtfully. </span>
<span sid='22560' title='22560'>White Mason chuckled and rubbed his fat hands together in his professional satisfaction.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22561' title='22561'>'I said it was a snorter!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='22562' title='22562'>'And a real snorter it is!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22563' title='22563'>CHAPTER 6 : A Dawning Light</span>
<p>
<span sid='22564' title='22564'>The three detectives had many matters of detail into which to inquire, so I returned alone to our modest quarters at the village inn; but before doing so I took a stroll in the curious old-world garden which flanked the house. </span>
<span sid='22565' title='22565'>Rows of very ancient yew trees, cut into strange designs, girded it round. </span>
<span sid='22566' title='22566'>Inside was a beautiful stretch of lawn with an old sundial in the middle, the whole effect so soothing and restful that it was welcome to my somewhat jangled nerves. </span>
<span sid='22567' title='22567'>In that deeply peaceful atmosphere one could forget or remember only as some fantastic nightmare that darkened study with the sprawling, blood-stained figure upon the floor. </span>
<span sid='22568' title='22568'>And yet as I strolled round it and tried to steep my soul in its gentle balm, a strange incident occurred which brought me back to the tragedy and left a sinister impression on my mind.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22569' title='22569'>I have said that a decoration of yew trees circled the garden. </span>
<span sid='22570' title='22570'>At the end which was farthest from the house they thickened into a continuous hedge. </span>
<span sid='22571' title='22571'>On the other side of this hedge, concealed from the eyes of any one approaching from the direction of the house, there was a stone seat. </span>
<span sid='22572' title='22572'>As I approached the spot I was aware of voices, some remark in the deep tones of a man, answered by a little ripple of feminine laughter. </span>
<span sid='22573' title='22573'>An instant later I had come round the end of the hedge, and my eyes lit upon Mrs Douglas and the man Barker before they were aware of my presence. </span>
<span sid='22574' title='22574'>Her appearance gave me a shock. </span>
<span sid='22575' title='22575'>In the dining-room she had been demure and discreet. </span>
<span sid='22576' title='22576'>Now all pretence of grief had passed away from her. </span>
<span sid='22577' title='22577'>Her eyes shone with the joy of living, and her face still quivered with amusement at some remark of her companion. </span>
<span sid='22578' title='22578'>He sat forward, his hands clasped and his forearms on his knees, with an answering smile upon his bold, handsome face. </span>
<span sid='22579' title='22579'>In an instant - but it was just one instant too late - they resumed their solemn masks as my figure came into view. </span>
<span sid='22580' title='22580'>A hurried word or two passed between them, and then Barker rose and came towards me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22581' title='22581'>'Excuse me, sir,' said he, 'but am I addressing Dr Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22582' title='22582'>I bowed with a coldness which showed, I dare say, very plainly the impression which had been produced upon my mind.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22583' title='22583'>'We thought that it was probably you, as your friendship with Mr Sherlock Holmes is so well known. </span>
<span sid='22584' title='22584'>Would you mind coming over and speaking to Mrs Douglas for one instant?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22585' title='22585'>I followed him with a dour face. </span>
<span sid='22586' title='22586'>Very clearly I could see in my mind's eye that shattered figure upon the floor. </span>
<span sid='22587' title='22587'>Here within a few hours of the tragedy were his wife and his nearest friend laughing together behind a bush in the garden which had been his. </span>
<span sid='22588' title='22588'>I greeted the lady with reserve. </span>
<span sid='22589' title='22589'>I had grieved with her grief in the dining-room. </span>
<span sid='22590' title='22590'>Now I met her appealing gaze with an unresponsive eye.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22591' title='22591'>'I fear you think me callous and hard-hearted?' said she. </span>
<span sid='22592' title='22592'>I shrugged my shoulders.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22593' title='22593'>'It is no business of mine,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22594' title='22594'>'Perhaps some day you will do me justice. </span>
<span sid='22595' title='22595'>If you only realized-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22596' title='22596'>'There is no need why Dr Watson should realize,' said Barker, quickly. </span>
<span sid='22597' title='22597'>'As he has himself said, it is no possible business of his.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22598' title='22598'>'Exactly,' said I, 'and so I will beg leave to resume my walk.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22599' title='22599'>'One moment, Dr Watson,' cried the woman, in a pleading voice. </span>
<span sid='22600' title='22600'>'There is one question which you can answer with more authority than anyone else in the world, and it may make a very great difference to me. </span>
<span sid='22601' title='22601'>You know Mr Holmes and his relations with the police better than anyone else can do. </span>
<span sid='22602' title='22602'>Supposing that a matter were brought confidentially to his knowledge, is it absolutely necessary that he should pass it on to the detectives?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22603' title='22603'>'Yes, that's it,' said Barker, eagerly. </span>
<span sid='22604' title='22604'>'Is he on his own or is he entirely in with them?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22605' title='22605'>'I really don't know that I should be justified in discussing such a point.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22606' title='22606'>'I beg - I implore that you will, Dr Watson, I assure you that you will be helping us - helping me greatly if you will guide us on that point.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22607' title='22607'>There was such a ring of sincerity in the woman's voice that for the instant I forgot all about her levity and was moved only to do her will.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22608' title='22608'>'Mr Holmes is an independent investigator,' I said. </span>
<span sid='22609' title='22609'>'He is his own master, and would act as his own judgement directed. </span>
<span sid='22610' title='22610'>At the same time he would naturally feel loyalty towards the officials who were working on the same case, and he would not conceal from them anything which would help them in bringing a criminal to justice. </span>
<span sid='22611' title='22611'>Beyond this I can say nothing, and I would refer you to Mr Holmes himself if you want fuller information.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22612' title='22612'>So saying I raised my hat and went upon my way, leaving them still seated behind that concealing hedge. </span>
<span sid='22613' title='22613'>I looked back as I rounded the far end of it, and saw that they were still talking very earnestly together, and, as they were gazing after me, it was clear that it was our interview that was the subject of their debate.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22614' title='22614'>'I wish none of their confidences,' said Holmes, when I reported to him what had occurred. </span>
<span sid='22615' title='22615'>He had spent the whole afternoon at the Manor House in consultation with his two colleagues, and returned about five with a ravenous appetite for a high tea which I had ordered for him. </span>
<span sid='22616' title='22616'>'No confidences, Watson, for they are mighty awkward if it comes to an arrest for conspiracy and murder.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22617' title='22617'>'You think it will come to that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22618' title='22618'>He was in his most cheerful and debonnaire humour.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22619' title='22619'>'My dear Watson, when I have exterminated that fourth egg I will be ready to put you in touch with the whole situation. </span>
<span sid='22620' title='22620'>I don't say that we have fathomed it - far from it - but when we have traced the missing dumb-bell--'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22621' title='22621'>'The dumb-bell!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22622' title='22622'>'Dear me, Watson, is it possible that you have not penetrated the fact that the case hangs upon the missing dumb-bell? </span>
<span sid='22623' title='22623'>Well, well, you need not be downcast, for, between ourselves, I don't think that either Inspector Mac or the excellent local practitioner has grasped the overwhelming importance of this incident. </span>
<span sid='22624' title='22624'>One dumb-bell, Watson! </span>
<span sid='22625' title='22625'>Consider an athlete with one dumb-bell. </span>
<span sid='22626' title='22626'>Picture to yourself the unilateral development - the imminent danger of a spinal curvature. </span>
<span sid='22627' title='22627'>Shocking, Watson; shocking!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22628' title='22628'>He sat with his mouth full of toast and his eyes sparkling with mischief, watching my intellectual entanglement. </span>
<span sid='22629' title='22629'>The mere sight of his excellent appetite was an assurance of success, for I had very clear recollections of days and nights without a thought of food, when his baffled mind had chafed before some problem whilst his thin, eager features became more attenuated with the asceticism of complete mental concentration. </span>
<span sid='22630' title='22630'>Finally he lit his pipe and, sitting in the ingle-nook of the old village inn, he talked slowly and at random about his case, rather as one thinks aloud than as one who makes a considered statement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22631' title='22631'>'A lie, Watson - a great big, thumping, obtrusive, uncompromising lie - that's what meets us on the threshold. </span>
<span sid='22632' title='22632'>There is our starting point. </span>
<span sid='22633' title='22633'>The whole story told by Barker is a lie. </span>
<span sid='22634' title='22634'>But Barker's story is corroborated by Mrs Douglas. </span>
<span sid='22635' title='22635'>Therefore she is lying also. </span>
<span sid='22636' title='22636'>They are both lying and in a conspiracy. </span>
<span sid='22637' title='22637'>So now we have the clear problem--why are they lying, and what is the truth which they are trying so hard to conceal? </span>
<span sid='22638' title='22638'>Let us try, Watson, you and I, if we can get behind the lie and reconstruct the truth.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22639' title='22639'>'How do I know that they are lying? </span>
<span sid='22640' title='22640'>Because it is a clumsy fabrication which simply could not be true. </span>
<span sid='22641' title='22641'>Consider! </span>
<span sid='22642' title='22642'>According to the story given to us the assassin had less than a minute after the murder had been committed to take that ring, which was under another ring, from the dead man's finger, to replace the other ring - a thing which he would surely never have done - and to put that singular card beside his victim. </span>
<span sid='22643' title='22643'>I say that this was obviously impossible. </span>
<span sid='22644' title='22644'>You may argue - but I have too much respect for your judgement, Watson, to think that you will do so - that the ring may have been taken before the man was killed. </span>
<span sid='22645' title='22645'>The fact that the candle had only been lit a short time shows that there had been no lengthy interview. </span>
<span sid='22646' title='22646'>Was Douglas, from what we hear of his fearless character, a man who would be likely to give up his wedding-ring at such short notice, or could we conceive of his giving it up at all? </span>
<span sid='22647' title='22647'>No, no, Watson, the assassin was alone with the dead man for some time with the lamp lit. </span>
<span sid='22648' title='22648'>Of that I have no doubt at all. </span>
<span sid='22649' title='22649'>But the gunshot was apparently the cause of death. </span>
<span sid='22650' title='22650'>Therefore the gunshot must have been fired some time earlier than we are told. </span>
<span sid='22651' title='22651'>But there could be no mistake about such a matter as that. </span>
<span sid='22652' title='22652'>We are in the presence, therefore, of a deliberate conspiracy upon the part of the two people who heard the gunshot - of the man Barker and of the woman Douglas. </span>
<span sid='22653' title='22653'>When on the top of this I am able to show that the bloodmark upon the window-sill was deliberately placed there by Barker in order to give a false clue to the police, you will admit that the case grows dark against him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22654' title='22654'>'Now we have to ask ourselves at what hour the murder actually did occur. </span>
<span sid='22655' title='22655'>Up to half-past ten the servants were moving about the house, so it was certainly not before that time. </span>
<span sid='22656' title='22656'>At a quarter to eleven they had all gone to their rooms with the exception of Ames, who was in the pantry. </span>
<span sid='22657' title='22657'>I have been trying some experiments after you left us this afternoon, and I find that no noise which MacDonald can make in the study can penetrate to me in the pantry when the doors are all shut. </span>
<span sid='22658' title='22658'>It is otherwise, however, from the housekeeper's room. </span>
<span sid='22659' title='22659'>It is not so far down the corridor, and from it I could vaguely hear a voice when it was very loudly raised. </span>
<span sid='22660' title='22660'>The sound from a shot-gun is to some extent muffled when the discharge is at very close range, as it undoubtedly was in this instance. </span>
<span sid='22661' title='22661'>It would not be very loud, and yet in the silence of the night it should have easily penetrated to Mrs Allen's room. </span>
<span sid='22662' title='22662'>She is, as she has told us, somewhat deaf, but none the less she mentioned in her evidence that she did hear something like a door slamming half an hour before the alarm was given. </span>
<span sid='22663' title='22663'>Half an hour before the alarm was given would be a quarter to eleven. </span>
<span sid='22664' title='22664'>I have no doubt that what she heard was the report of the gun, and that this was the real instant of the murder. </span>
<span sid='22665' title='22665'>If this is so, we have now to determine what Mr Barker and Mrs Douglas, presuming that they are not the actual murderers, could have been doing from a quarter to eleven, when the sound of the gun-shot brought them down, until a quarter past eleven, when they rang the bell and summoned the servants. </span>
<span sid='22666' title='22666'>What were they doing, and why did they not instantly give the alarm? </span>
<span sid='22667' title='22667'>That is the question which faces us, and when it has been answered we will surely have gone some way to solve our problem.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22668' title='22668'>'I am convinced myself,' said I, 'that there is an understanding between those two people. </span>
<span sid='22669' title='22669'>She must be a heartless creature to sit laughing at some jest within a few hours of her husband's murder.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22670' title='22670'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='22671' title='22671'>She does not shine as a wife even in her own account of what occurred. </span>
<span sid='22672' title='22672'>I am not a whole-souled admirer of womankind, as you are aware, Watson, but my experience of life has taught me that there are few wives having any regard for their husbands who would let any man's spoken word stand between them and that husband's dead body. </span>
<span sid='22673' title='22673'>Should I ever marry, Watson, I should hope to inspire my wife with some feeling which would prevent her from being walked off by a housekeeper when my corpse was lying within a few yards of her. </span>
<span sid='22674' title='22674'>It was badly stage-managed, for even the rawest of investigators must be struck by the absence of the usual feminine ululation. </span>
<span sid='22675' title='22675'>If there had been nothing else, this incident alone would have suggested a pre-arranged conspiracy to my mind.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22676' title='22676'>'You think, then, definitely, that Barker and Mrs Douglas are guilty of the murder?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22677' title='22677'>'There is an appalling directness about your questions, Watson,' said Holmes, shaking his pipe at me. </span>
<span sid='22678' title='22678'>'They come at me like bullets. </span>
<span sid='22679' title='22679'>If you put it that Mrs Douglas and Barker know the truth about the murder and are conspiring to conceal it, then I can give you a whole-souled answer. </span>
<span sid='22680' title='22680'>I am tire they do. </span>
<span sid='22681' title='22681'>But your more deadly proposition is not so clear. </span>
<span sid='22682' title='22682'>Let us for a moment consider the difficulties which stand in the way.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22683' title='22683'>'We will suppose that this couple are united by the bonds of a guilty love and that they have determined to get rid of the man who stands between them. </span>
<span sid='22684' title='22684'>It is a large supposition, for discreet inquiry among servants and others has failed to corroborate it in any way. </span>
<span sid='22685' title='22685'>On the contrary, there is a good deal of evidence that the Douglases were very attached to each other.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22686' title='22686'>'That I am sure cannot be true,' said I, thinking of the beautiful, smiling face in the garden.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22687' title='22687'>'Well, at least they gave that impression. </span>
<span sid='22688' title='22688'>However, we will suppose that they are an extraordinarily astute couple, who deceive everyone upon this point and who conspire to murder the husband. </span>
<span sid='22689' title='22689'>He happens to be a man over whose head some danger hangs-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22690' title='22690'>'We have only their word for that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22691' title='22691'>Holmes looked thoughtful.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22692' title='22692'>'I see, Watson. </span>
<span sid='22693' title='22693'>You are sketching out a theory by which everything they say from the beginning is false. </span>
<span sid='22694' title='22694'>According to your idea, there was never any hidden menace or secret society or Valley of Fear or Boss MacSomebody or anything else. </span>
<span sid='22695' title='22695'>Well, that is a good, sweeping generalization. </span>
<span sid='22696' title='22696'>Let us see what that brings us to. </span>
<span sid='22697' title='22697'>They invent this theory to account for the crime. </span>
<span sid='22698' title='22698'>They then play up to the idea by leaving this bicycle in the park as a proof of the existence of some outsider. </span>
<span sid='22699' title='22699'>The stain on the window-sill conveys the same idea. </span>
<span sid='22700' title='22700'>So does the card upon the body, which might have been prepared in the house. </span>
<span sid='22701' title='22701'>That all fits into your hypothesis, Watson. </span>
<span sid='22702' title='22702'>But now we come on the nasty angular, uncompromising bits which won't slip into their places. </span>
<span sid='22703' title='22703'>Why a cut-off shot-gun of all weapons - and an <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n one at that? </span>
<span sid='22704' title='22704'>How could they be so sure that the sound of it would not bring someone on to them? </span>
<span sid='22705' title='22705'>It's a mere chance, as it is, that Mrs Allen did not start out to inquire for the slamming door. </span>
<span sid='22706' title='22706'>Why did your guilty couple do all this, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22707' title='22707'>'I confess that I can't explain it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22708' title='22708'>'Then, again, if a woman and her lover conspire to murder a husband, are they going to advertise their guilt by ostentatiously removing his wedding-ring after his death? </span>
<span sid='22709' title='22709'>Does that strike you as very probable, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22710' title='22710'>'No, it does not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22711' title='22711'>'And once again, if the thought of leaving a bicycle concealed outside had occurred to you, would it really have seemed worth doing when the dullest detective would naturally say this is an obvious blind, as the bicycle is the first thing which the fugitive needed in order to make his escape?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22712' title='22712'>'I can conceive of no explanation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22713' title='22713'>'And yet there should be no combination of events for which the wit of man cannot conceive an explanation. </span>
<span sid='22714' title='22714'>Simply as a mental exercise, without any assertion that it is true, let me indicate a possible line of thought. </span>
<span sid='22715' title='22715'>It is, I admit, mere imagination, but how often is imagination the mother of truth?</span>
<p>
<span sid='22716' title='22716'>'We will suppose that there was a guilty secret, a really shameful secret, in the life of this man Douglas. </span>
<span sid='22717' title='22717'>This leads to his murder by someone who is, we will suppose, an avenger - someone from outside. </span>
<span sid='22718' title='22718'>This avenger, for some reason which I confess I am still at a loss to explain, took the dead man's wedding-ring. </span>
<span sid='22719' title='22719'>The vendetta might conceivably date back to the man's first marriage and the ring be taken for some such reason. </span>
<span sid='22720' title='22720'>Before this avenger got away Barker and the wife had reached the room. </span>
<span sid='22721' title='22721'>The assassin convinced them that any attempt to arrest him would lead to the publication of some hideous scandal. </span>
<span sid='22722' title='22722'>They were converted to this idea and preferred to let him go. </span>
<span sid='22723' title='22723'>For this purpose they probably lowered the bridge, which can be done quite noiselessly, and then raised it again. </span>
<span sid='22724' title='22724'>He made his escape, and for some reason thought that he could do so more safely on foot than on the bicycle. </span>
<span sid='22725' title='22725'>He therefore left his machine where it would not be discovered until he had got safely away. </span>
<span sid='22726' title='22726'>So far we are within the bounds of possibility, are we not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22727' title='22727'>'Well, it is possible, no doubt,' said I, with some reserve. </span>
<span sid='22728' title='22728'>We have to remember, Watson, that whatever occurred certainly something very extraordinary. </span>
<span sid='22729' title='22729'>Well now, to continue our suppositious case, the couple - not necessarily a guilty couple - realize after the murderer is gone that they have placed themselves in a position in which it may be difficult for them to prove that they did not themselves either do the deed or connive at it. </span>
<span sid='22730' title='22730'>They rapidly and rather clumsily met the situation. </span>
<span sid='22731' title='22731'>The mark was put by Barker's blood-stained slipper upon the window-sill to suggest how the fugitive got away. </span>
<span sid='22732' title='22732'>They obviously were the two who must have heard the sound of the gun, so they gave the alarm exactly as they would have done, but a good half-hour after the event.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22733' title='22733'>'And how do you propose to prove all this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22734' title='22734'>'Well, if there were an outsider he may be traced and taken. </span>
<span sid='22735' title='22735'>That would be the most effective of all proofs. </span>
<span sid='22736' title='22736'>But if not - well, the resources of science are far from being exhausted. </span>
<span sid='22737' title='22737'>I think that an evening alone in that study would help me much.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22738' title='22738'>'An evening alone!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22739' title='22739'>'I propose to go up there presently. </span>
<span sid='22740' title='22740'>I have arranged it with the estimable Ames, who is by no means whole-hearted about Barker. </span>
<span sid='22741' title='22741'>I shall sit in that room and see if its atmosphere brings me inspiration. </span>
<span sid='22742' title='22742'>I'm a believer in the genius loci. </span>
<span sid='22743' title='22743'>You smile, friend Watson. </span>
<span sid='22744' title='22744'>Well, we shall see. </span>
<span sid='22745' title='22745'>By the way, you have that big umbrella of yours, have you not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22746' title='22746'>'It is here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22747' title='22747'>'Well, I'll borrow that, if I may.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22748' title='22748'>'Certainly, but what a wretched weapon! </span>
<span sid='22749' title='22749'>If there is danger-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22750' title='22750'>'Nothing serious, my dear Watson, or I should certainly ask for your assistance. </span>
<span sid='22751' title='22751'>But I'll take the umbrella. </span>
<span sid='22752' title='22752'>At present I am only awaiting the return of our colleagues from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Tunbridge Wells&t=h'>Tunbridge Wells</a>, where they are at present engaged in trying for a likely owner to the bicycle.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22753' title='22753'>It was nightfall before Inspector MacDonald and White Mason came back from their expedition, and they arrived exultant, reporting a great advance in our investigation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22754' title='22754'>'Man, I'll admeet that I had my doubts if there was ever an outsider,' said MacDonald, 'but that's all past now. </span>
<span sid='22755' title='22755'>We've had the bicycle identified, and we have a description of our man, so that's a long step on our journey.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22756' title='22756'>'It sounds to me like the beginning of the end,' said Holmes; 'I'm sure I congratulate you both with all my heart.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22757' title='22757'>'Well, I started from the fact that Mr Douglas had seemed disturbed since the day before, when he had been at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Tunbridge Wells&t=h'>Tunbridge Wells</a>. </span>
<span sid='22758' title='22758'>It was at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Tunbridge Wells&t=h'>Tunbridge Wells</a>, then, that he had become conscious of some danger. </span>
<span sid='22759' title='22759'>It was clear, therefore, that if a man had come over with a bicycle it was from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Tunbridge Wells&t=h'>Tunbridge Wells</a> that he might be expected to have come. </span>
<span sid='22760' title='22760'>We took the bicycle over with us and showed it at the hotels. </span>
<span sid='22761' title='22761'>It was identified at once by the manager of the Eagle Commercial as belonging to a man named Hargrave who had taken a room there two days before. </span>
<span sid='22762' title='22762'>This bicycle and a small valise were his whole belongings. </span>
<span sid='22763' title='22763'>He had registered his name as coming from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, but had given no address. </span>
<span sid='22764' title='22764'>The valise was <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>-made and the contents were British, but the man himself was undoubtedly an <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22765' title='22765'>'Well, well,' said Holmes, gleefully, 'you have indeed done some solid work whilst I have been sitting spinning theories with my friend. </span>
<span sid='22766' title='22766'>It's a lesson in being practical, Mr Mac.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22767' title='22767'>'Aye, it's just that, Mr Holmes,' said the inspector with satisfaction.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22768' title='22768'>'But this may all fit in with your theories,' I remarked. </span>
<span sid='22769' title='22769'>'That may or may not be. </span>
<span sid='22770' title='22770'>But let us hear the end, Mr Mac. </span>
<span sid='22771' title='22771'>Was there nothing to identify this man?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22772' title='22772'>'So little that it was evident he had carefully guarded himself against identification. </span>
<span sid='22773' title='22773'>There were no papers or letters and no marking upon the clothes. </span>
<span sid='22774' title='22774'>A cycle-map of the county lay upon his bedroom table. </span>
<span sid='22775' title='22775'>He had left the hotel after breakfast yesterday morning upon his bicycle, and no more was heard of him until our inquiries.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22776' title='22776'>'That's what puzzles me, Mr Holmes,' said White Mason. </span>
<span sid='22777' title='22777'>'If the fellow did not want the hue and cry raised over him, one would imagine that he would have returned and remained at the hotel as an inoffensive tourist. </span>
<span sid='22778' title='22778'>As it is, he must know that he will be reported to the police by the hotel manager, and that his disappearance will be connected with the murder.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22779' title='22779'>'So one would imagine. </span>
<span sid='22780' title='22780'>Still he has been justified of his wisdom up to date at any rate, since he has not been taken. </span>
<span sid='22781' title='22781'>But his description - what of that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22782' title='22782'>MacDonald referred to his notebook.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22783' title='22783'>'Here we have it so far as they could give it. </span>
<span sid='22784' title='22784'>They don't seem to have taken any very particular stock of him, but still the porter, the clerk, and the chambermaid are all agreed that this about covers the points. </span>
<span sid='22785' title='22785'>He was a man about five foot nine in height, fifty or so years of age, his hair slightly grizzled, a greyish moustache, a curved nose and a face which all of them described as fierce and forbidding.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22786' title='22786'>'Well, bar the expression, that might almost be a description of Douglas himself,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='22787' title='22787'>'He is just over fifty, with grizzled hair and moustache and about the same height. </span>
<span sid='22788' title='22788'>Did you get anything else?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22789' title='22789'>'He was dressed in a heavy grey suit with a reefer jacket, and he wore a short yellow overcoat and a soft cap.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22790' title='22790'>'What about the shot-gun?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22791' title='22791'>'It is less than two feet long. </span>
<span sid='22792' title='22792'>It could very well have fitted into his valise. </span>
<span sid='22793' title='22793'>He could have carried it inside his overcoat without difficulty.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22794' title='22794'>'And how do you consider that all this bears upon the general case?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22795' title='22795'>'Well, Mr Holmes,' said MacDonald, 'when we have got our man - and you may be sure that I had his description on the wires within five minutes of hearing it - we shall be able to judge. </span>
<span sid='22796' title='22796'>But even as it stands, we have surely gone a long way. </span>
<span sid='22797' title='22797'>We know that an <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n calling himself Hargrave came to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Tunbridge Wells&t=h'>Tunbridge Wells</a> two days ago with bicycle and valise. </span>
<span sid='22798' title='22798'>In the latter was a sawn-off shot-gun, so he came with the deliberate purpose of crime. </span>
<span sid='22799' title='22799'>Yesterday morning he set off for this place upon his bicycle with his gun concealed in his overcoat. </span>
<span sid='22800' title='22800'>No one saw him arrive, so far as we can learn, but he need not pass through the village to reach the park gates, and there are many cyclists upon the road. </span>
<span sid='22801' title='22801'>Presumably he at once concealed his cycle among the laurels, where it was found, and possibly lurked there himself, with his eye on the house waiting for Mr Douglas o come out. </span>
<span sid='22802' title='22802'>The shot-gun is a strange weapon to use inside a house, but he had intended to use it outside, and then it has very obvious advantages, as it would be impossible to miss with it, and the sound of shots is so common in an English sporting neighbourhood that no particular notice would be taken.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22803' title='22803'>'That is all very clear!' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22804' title='22804'>'Well, Mr Douglas did not appear. </span>
<span sid='22805' title='22805'>What was he to do next? </span>
<span sid='22806' title='22806'>He left his bicycle and approached the house in the twilight. </span>
<span sid='22807' title='22807'>He found the bridge down and no one about. </span>
<span sid='22808' title='22808'>He took his chance, intending, no doubt, to make some excuse if he met anyone. </span>
<span sid='22809' title='22809'>He met no one. </span>
<span sid='22810' title='22810'>He slipped into the first room that he saw and concealed himself behind the curtain. </span>
<span sid='22811' title='22811'>From thence he could see the drawbridge go up and he knew that his only escape was through the moat. </span>
<span sid='22812' title='22812'>He waited until a quarter past eleven, when Mr Douglas, upon his usual nightly round, came into the room. </span>
<span sid='22813' title='22813'>He shot him and escaped, as arranged. </span>
<span sid='22814' title='22814'>He was aware that the bicycle would be described by the hotel people and be a clue against him, so he left it there and made his way by some other means to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> or to some safe hiding-place which he had already arranged. </span>
<span sid='22815' title='22815'>How is that, Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22816' title='22816'>'Well, Mr Mac, it is very good and very clear so far as it goes. </span>
<span sid='22817' title='22817'>That is your end of the story. </span>
<span sid='22818' title='22818'>My end is that the crime was committed half an hour earlier than reported; that Mrs Douglas and Mr Barker are both in a conspiracy to conceal something; that they aided the murderer's escape - or at least, that they reached the room before he escaped - and that they fabricated evidence of his escape through the window, whereas in all probability they had themselves let him go by lowering the bridge. </span>
<span sid='22819' title='22819'>That's my reading of the first half.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22820' title='22820'>The two detectives shook their heads.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22821' title='22821'>'Well, Mr Holmes, if this is true we only tumble out of one mystery into another,' said the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> inspector.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22822' title='22822'>'And in some ways a worse one,' added White Mason. </span>
<span sid='22823' title='22823'>'The lady has never been in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a> in her life. </span>
<span sid='22824' title='22824'>What possible connection could she have with an <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n assassin which would cause her to shelter him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22825' title='22825'>'I freely admit the difficulties,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='22826' title='22826'>'I propose to make a little investigation of my own tonight, and it is just possible that it may contribute something to the common cause.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22827' title='22827'>'Can we help you, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22828' title='22828'>'No, no! </span>
<span sid='22829' title='22829'>Darkness and Dr Watson's umbrella. </span>
<span sid='22830' title='22830'>My wants are simple. </span>
<span sid='22831' title='22831'>And Ames - the faithful Ames - no doubt he will stretch a point for me. </span>
<span sid='22832' title='22832'>All my lines of thought lead me back invariably to the one basic question - why should an athletic man develop his frame upon so unnatural an instrument as a single dumb-bell?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22833' title='22833'>It was late that night when Holmes returned from his solitary excursion. </span>
<span sid='22834' title='22834'>We slept in a double-bedded room, which was the best that the little country inn could do for us. </span>
<span sid='22835' title='22835'>I was already asleep when I was partly awakened by his entrance.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22836' title='22836'>'Well, Holmes,' I murmured, 'have you found out anything?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22837' title='22837'>He stood beside me in silence, his candle in his hand. </span>
<span sid='22838' title='22838'>Then the tall lean figure inclined towards me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22839' title='22839'>'I say, Watson,' he whispered, 'would you be afraid to sleep in the same room as a lunatic, a man with softening of the brain, an idiot whose mind has lost its grip?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22840' title='22840'>'Not in the least,' I answered in astonishment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22841' title='22841'>'Ah, that's lucky,' he said, and not another word would he utter that night.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22842' title='22842'>CHAPTER 7 : The Solution</span>
<p>
<span sid='22843' title='22843'>Next morning, after breakfast, we found Inspector MacDonald and Mr White Mason seated in close consultation in the small parlour of the local police-sergeant. </span>
<span sid='22844' title='22844'>Upon the table in front of them were piled a number of letters and telegrams, which they were carefully sorting and docketing. </span>
<span sid='22845' title='22845'>Three had been placed upon one side.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22846' title='22846'>'Still on the track of the elusive bicyclist?' Holmes asked, cheerfully. </span>
<span sid='22847' title='22847'>'What is the latest news of the ruffian?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22848' title='22848'>MacDonald pointed ruefully to his heap of correspondence.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22849' title='22849'>'He is at present reported from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Leicester&t=h'>Leicester</a>, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Nottingham&t=h'>Nottingham</a>, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Southampton&t=h'>Southampton</a>, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Derby&t=h'>Derby</a>, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=East Ham&t=h'>East Ham</a>, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Richmond&t=h'>Richmond</a>, and fourteen other places. </span>
<span sid='22850' title='22850'>In three of them - <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=East Ham&t=h'>East Ham</a>, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Leicester&t=h'>Leicester</a>, and <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Liverpool&t=h'>Liverpool</a> - there is a clear case against him and he has actually been arrested. </span>
<span sid='22851' title='22851'>The country seems to be full of fugitives with yellow coats.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22852' title='22852'>'Dear me!' said Holmes, sympathetically. </span>
<span sid='22853' title='22853'>'Now, Mr Mac, and you, Mr White Mason, I wish to give you a very earnest piece of advice. </span>
<span sid='22854' title='22854'>When I went into this case with you I bargained, as you will no doubt remember, that I should not present you with half-proved theories, but that I should retain and work out my own ideas until I had satisfied myself that they were correct. </span>
<span sid='22855' title='22855'>For this reason I am not at the present moment telling you all that is in my mind. </span>
<span sid='22856' title='22856'>On the other hand, I said that I would play the game fairly by you, and I do not think it is a fair game to allow you for one unnecessary moment to waste your energies upon a profitless task. </span>
<span sid='22857' title='22857'>Therefore I am here to advice you this morning, and my advice to you is summed up in three words: </span>
<span sid='22858' title='22858'>Abandon the case.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22859' title='22859'>MacDonald and White Mason stared in amazement at their celebrated colleague.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22860' title='22860'>'You consider it hopeless?' cried the inspector.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22861' title='22861'>'I consider your case to be hopeless. </span>
<span sid='22862' title='22862'>I do not consider that it is hopeless to arrive at the truth.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22863' title='22863'>'But this cyclist. </span>
<span sid='22864' title='22864'>He is not an invention. </span>
<span sid='22865' title='22865'>We have his description, his valise, his bicycle. </span>
<span sid='22866' title='22866'>The fellow must be somewhere. </span>
<span sid='22867' title='22867'>Why should we not get him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22868' title='22868'>'Yes, yes; no doubt he is somewhere, and no doubt we shall get him, but I would not have you waste your energies in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=East Ham&t=h'>East Ham</a> or <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Liverpool&t=h'>Liverpool</a>. </span>
<span sid='22869' title='22869'>I am sure that we can find some shorter cut to a result.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22870' title='22870'>'You are holding something back. </span>
<span sid='22871' title='22871'>It's hardly fair of you, Mr Holmes.' </span>
<span sid='22872' title='22872'>The inspector was annoyed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22873' title='22873'>'You know my methods of work, Mr Mac. </span>
<span sid='22874' title='22874'>But I will hold it back for the shortest time possible. </span>
<span sid='22875' title='22875'>I only wish to verify my details in one way, which can very readily be done, and then I make my bow and return to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, leaving my results entirely at your service. </span>
<span sid='22876' title='22876'>I owe you too much to act otherwise, for in all my experience I cannot recall any more singular and interesting study.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22877' title='22877'>'This is clean beyond me, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='22878' title='22878'>We saw you when we returned from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Tunbridge Wells&t=h'>Tunbridge Wells</a> last night, and you were in general agreement with our results. </span>
<span sid='22879' title='22879'>What has happened since then to give you a completely new idea of the case?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22880' title='22880'>'Well, since you ask me, I spent as I told you that I would, some hours last night at the Manor House.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22881' title='22881'>'Well, what happened?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22882' title='22882'>'Ah! </span>
<span sid='22883' title='22883'>I can only give you a very general answer to that for the moment. </span>
<span sid='22884' title='22884'>By the way, I have been reading a short, but clear and interesting, account of the old building, purchasable at the modest sum of one penny from the local tobacconist.' </span>
<span sid='22885' title='22885'>Here Holmes drew a small tract, embellished with a rude engraving of the ancient Manor House, from his waistcoat pocket. </span>
<span sid='22886' title='22886'>'It immensely adds to the zest of an investigation, my dear Mr Mac, when one is in conscious sympathy with the historical atmosphere of one's surroundings. </span>
<span sid='22887' title='22887'>Don't look so impatient, for I assure you that even so bald an account as this raises some sort of picture of the past in one's mind. </span>
<span sid='22888' title='22888'>Permit me to give you a sample. </span>
<span sid='22889' title='22889'>"Erected in the fifth year of the reign of James I, and standing upon the site of a much older building, the Manor House of Birlstone presents one of the finest surviving examples of the moated Jacobean residence-"'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22890' title='22890'>'You are making fools of us, Mr Holmes!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22891' title='22891'>'Tut, tut, Mr Mac! - the first sign of temper I have detected in you. </span>
<span sid='22892' title='22892'>Well, I won't read it verbatim, since you feel so strongly upon the subject. </span>
<span sid='22893' title='22893'>But when I tell you that there is some account of the taking of the place by a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Parliament&t=h'>Parliament</a>ary colonel in 1644, of the concealment of Charles for several days in the course of the Civil War, and finally of a visit there by the second George, you will admit that there are various associations of interest connected with this ancient house.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22894' title='22894'>'I don't doubt it, Mr Holmes, but that is no business of ours.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22895' title='22895'>'Is it not? </span>
<span sid='22896' title='22896'>Is it not? </span>
<span sid='22897' title='22897'>Breadth of view, my dear Mr Mac, is one of the essentials of our profession. </span>
<span sid='22898' title='22898'>The interplay of ideas and the oblique uses of knowledge are often of extraordinary interest. </span>
<span sid='22899' title='22899'>You will excuse these remarks from one who, though a mere connoisseur of crime, is still rather older and perhaps more experienced than yourself:</span>
<p>
<span sid='22900' title='22900'>'I'm the first to admit that,' said the detective, heartily. </span>
<span sid='22901' title='22901'>You get to your point, I admit, but you have such a deuced round-the-corner way of doing it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22902' title='22902'>'Well, well, I'll drop past history and get down to present-day facts. </span>
<span sid='22903' title='22903'>I called last night, as I have already said, at the Manor House. </span>
<span sid='22904' title='22904'>I did not see either Mr Barker or Mrs Douglas. </span>
<span sid='22905' title='22905'>I saw no necessity to disturb them, but I was pleased to hear that the lady was not visibly pining and that she had partaken of an excellent dinner. </span>
<span sid='22906' title='22906'>My visit was specially made to the good Mr Ames, with whom I exchanged some amiabilities which culminated in his allowing me, without reference to anyone else, to sit alone for a time in the study.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22907' title='22907'>'What! </span>
<span sid='22908' title='22908'>With that!' I ejaculated.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22909' title='22909'>'No, no; everything is now in order. </span>
<span sid='22910' title='22910'>You gave permission for that, Mr Mac, as I am informed. </span>
<span sid='22911' title='22911'>The room was in its normal state, and in it I passed an instructive quarter of an hour.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22912' title='22912'>'What were you doing?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22913' title='22913'>'Well, not to make a mystery of so simple a matter, I was looking for the missing dumb-bell. </span>
<span sid='22914' title='22914'>It has always bulked rather large in my estimate of the case. </span>
<span sid='22915' title='22915'>I ended by finding it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22916' title='22916'>'Where?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22917' title='22917'>'Ah! </span>
<span sid='22918' title='22918'>There we come to the edge of the unexplored. </span>
<span sid='22919' title='22919'>Let me go a little farther, a very little farther, and I will promise that you shall share everything that I know.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22920' title='22920'>'Well, we're bound to take you on your own terms,' said the inspector; 'but when it comes to telling us to abandon the case - Why, in the name of goodness, should we abandon the case?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22921' title='22921'>'For the simple reason, my dear Mr Mac, that you have not got the first idea what it is that you are investigating.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22922' title='22922'>'We are investigating the murder of Mr John Douglas, of Birlstone Manor.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22923' title='22923'>'Yes, yes; so you are. </span>
<span sid='22924' title='22924'>But don't trouble to trace the mysterious gentleman upon the bicycle. </span>
<span sid='22925' title='22925'>I assure you that it won't help you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22926' title='22926'>'Then what do you suggest that we do?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22927' title='22927'>'I will tell you exactly what to do, if you will do it.' </span>
<span sid='22928' title='22928'>'Well, I'm bound to say I've always found you had reason behind all your queer ways. </span>
<span sid='22929' title='22929'>I'll do what you advise.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22930' title='22930'>'And you, Mr White Mason?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22931' title='22931'>The country detective looked helplessly from one to the other. </span>
<span sid='22932' title='22932'>Mr Holmes and his methods were new to him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22933' title='22933'>'Well, if it is good enough for the inspector it is good enough for me,' he said, at last.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22934' title='22934'>'Capital!' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='22935' title='22935'>'Well, then, I should recommend a nice, cheery, country walk for both of you. </span>
<span sid='22936' title='22936'>They tell me that the views from Birlstone Ridge over <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Weald&t=h'>the Weald</a> are very remarkable. </span>
<span sid='22937' title='22937'>No doubt lunch could be got at some suitable hostelry, though my ignorance of the country prevents me from recommending one. </span>
<span sid='22938' title='22938'>In the evening, tired but happy-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22939' title='22939'>'Man, this is getting past a joke!' cried MacDonald, rising angrily from his chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22940' title='22940'>'Well, well, spend the day as you like,' said Holmes, patting him cheerfully on the shoulder. </span>
<span sid='22941' title='22941'>'Do what you like and go where you will, but meet me here before dusk without fail - without fail, Mr Mac.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22942' title='22942'>'That sounds more like sanity.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22943' title='22943'>'All of it was excellent advice, but I don't insist, so long as you are here when I need you. </span>
<span sid='22944' title='22944'>But now, before we part, I want you to write a note to Mr Barker.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22945' title='22945'>'Well?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22946' title='22946'>'I'll dictate it, if you like. </span>
<span sid='22947' title='22947'>Ready?</span>
<p>
<span sid='22948' title='22948'>"Dear Sir, - It has struck me that it is our duty to drain the moat, in the hope that we may find some-"'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22949' title='22949'>'It's impossible,' said the inspector; 'I've made inquiry.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22950' title='22950'>'Tut, tut, my dear sir! </span>
<span sid='22951' title='22951'>Do, please, do what I ask you.' </span>
<span sid='22952' title='22952'>'Well, go on.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22953' title='22953'>'"-in the hope that we may find something which may bear upon our investigation. </span>
<span sid='22954' title='22954'>I have made arrangements, and the workmen will be at work early to-morrow morning diverting the stream - "'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22955' title='22955'>'Impossible!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22956' title='22956'>'"-diverting the stream, so I thought it best to explain matters beforehand." </span>
<span sid='22957' title='22957'>Now sign that, and send it by hand about four o'clock. </span>
<span sid='22958' title='22958'>At that hour we shall meet again in this room. </span>
<span sid='22959' title='22959'>Until then we can each do what we like, for I can assure you that this inquiry has come to a definite pause.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22960' title='22960'>Evening was drawing in when we reassembled. </span>
<span sid='22961' title='22961'>Holmes was very serious in his manner, myself curious, and the detectives obviously critical and annoyed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22962' title='22962'>'Well, gentlemen,' said my friend, gravely, 'I am asking you now to put everything to the test with me, and you will judge for yourselves whether the observations which I have made justify the conclusions to which I have come. </span>
<span sid='22963' title='22963'>It is a chill evening, and I do not know how long our expedition may last, so I beg that you will wear your warmest coats. </span>
<span sid='22964' title='22964'>It is of the first importance that we should be in our places before it grows dark, so, with your permission, we will get started at once.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22965' title='22965'>We passed along the outer bounds of the Manor House park until we came to a place where there was a gap in the rails which fenced it. </span>
<span sid='22966' title='22966'>Through this we slipped, and then, in the gathering gloom, we followed Holmes until we had reached a shrubbery which lies nearly opposite to the main door and the drawbridge. </span>
<span sid='22967' title='22967'>The latter had not been raised. </span>
<span sid='22968' title='22968'>Holmes crouched down behind the screen of laurels, and we all three followed his example.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22969' title='22969'>'Well, what are we to do now?' asked MacDonald, with some gruffness.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22970' title='22970'>'Possess our souls in patience and make as little noise as possible,' Holmes answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22971' title='22971'>'What are we here for at all? </span>
<span sid='22972' title='22972'>I really think that you might treat us with more frankness.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22973' title='22973'>Holmes laughed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22974' title='22974'>'Watson insists that I am the dramatist in real life,' said he. </span>
<span sid='22975' title='22975'>'Some touch of the artist wells up within me and calls insistently for a well-staged performance. </span>
<span sid='22976' title='22976'>Surely our profession, Mr Mac, would be a drab and sordid one if we did not sometimes set the scene so as to glorify our results. </span>
<span sid='22977' title='22977'>The blunt accusation, the brutal tap upon the shoulder - what can one make of such a denouement? </span>
<span sid='22978' title='22978'>But the quick inference, the subtle trap, the clever forecast of coming events, the triumphant vindication of bold theories - are these not the pride and the justification of our life's work? </span>
<span sid='22979' title='22979'>At the present moment you thrill with the glamour of the situation and the anticipation of the hunter. </span>
<span sid='22980' title='22980'>Where would be that thrill if I had been as definite as a time-table? </span>
<span sid='22981' title='22981'>I only ask a little patience, Mr Mac, and all will be clear to you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22982' title='22982'>'Well, I hope the pride and justification and the rest of it will come before we all get our death of cold,' said the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> detective, with comic resignation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22983' title='22983'>We all had good reason to join in the aspiration, for our vigil was a long and bitter one. </span>
<span sid='22984' title='22984'>Slowly the shadows darkened over the long sombre face of the old house. </span>
<span sid='22985' title='22985'>A cold, damp reek from the moat chilled us to the bones and set our teeth chattering. </span>
<span sid='22986' title='22986'>There was a single lamp over the gateway and a steady globe of light in the fatal study. </span>
<span sid='22987' title='22987'>Everything else was dark and still.</span>
<p>
<span sid='22988' title='22988'>'How long is this to last?' asked the inspector, suddenly. </span>
<span sid='22989' title='22989'>'And what is it we are watching for?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22990' title='22990'>'I have no more notion than you how long it is to last,' Holmes answered with some asperity. </span>
<span sid='22991' title='22991'>'If criminals would always schedule their movements like railway trains it would certainly be more convenient for all of us. </span>
<span sid='22992' title='22992'>As to what it is we - Well, that's what we are watching for.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='22993' title='22993'>As he spoke the bright yellow light in the study was obscured by somebody passing to and fro before it. </span>
<span sid='22994' title='22994'>The laurels among which we lay were immediately opposite the window and not more than a hundred feet from it. </span>
<span sid='22995' title='22995'>Presently it was thrown open with a whining of hinges, and we could dimly see the dark outline of a man's head and shoulders looking out into the gloom. </span>
<span sid='22996' title='22996'>For some minutes he peered forth, in a furtive, stealthy fashion, as one who wishes to be assured that he is unobserved. </span>
<span sid='22997' title='22997'>Then he leaned forward, and in the intense silence we were aware of the soft lapping of agitated water. </span>
<span sid='22998' title='22998'>He seemed to be stirring up the moat with something which he held in his hand. </span>
<span sid='22999' title='22999'>Then suddenly he hauled something in as a fisherman lands a fish - some large, round object which obscured the light as it was dragged through the open casement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23000' title='23000'>'Now!' cried Holmes. </span>
<span sid='23001' title='23001'>'Now!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23002' title='23002'>We were all upon our feet, staggering after him with our stiffened limbs, whilst he, with one of those outflames of nervous energy which could make him on occasion both the most active and the strongest man that I have ever known, ran swiftly across the bridge and rang violently at the bell. </span>
<span sid='23003' title='23003'>There was the rasping of bolts from the other side, and the amazed Ames stood in the entrance. </span>
<span sid='23004' title='23004'>Holmes brushed him aside without a word and, followed by all of us, rushed into the room which had been occupied by the man whom we had been watching.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23005' title='23005'>The oil lamp on the table represented the glow which we had seen from outside. </span>
<span sid='23006' title='23006'>It was now in the hand of Cecil Barker, who held it towards us as we entered. </span>
<span sid='23007' title='23007'>Its light shone upon his strong, resolute, clean-shaven face and his menacing eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23008' title='23008'>'What the devil is the meaning of all this?' he cried. </span>
<span sid='23009' title='23009'>'What are you after, anyhow?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23010' title='23010'>Holmes took a swift glance round and then pounced upon a sodden bundle tied together with cord which lay where it had been thrust under the writing-table.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23011' title='23011'>'This is what we are after, Mr Barker. </span>
<span sid='23012' title='23012'>This bundle, weighted with a dumb-bell, which you have just raised from the bottom of the moat.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23013' title='23013'>Barker stared at Holmes with amazement in his face. </span>
<span sid='23014' title='23014'>'How in thunder came you to know anything about it?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23015' title='23015'>'Simply that I put it there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23016' title='23016'>'You put it there! </span>
<span sid='23017' title='23017'>You!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23018' title='23018'>'Perhaps I should have said "replaced it there",' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='23019' title='23019'>'You will remember, Inspector MacDonald, that I was somewhat struck by the absence of a dumb-bell. </span>
<span sid='23020' title='23020'>I drew your attention to it, but with the pressure of other events you had hardly the time to give it the consideration which would have enabled you to draw deductions from it. </span>
<span sid='23021' title='23021'>When water is near and a weight is missing it is not a very far-fetched supposition that something has been sunk in the water. </span>
<span sid='23022' title='23022'>The idea was at least worth testing, so with the help of Ames, who admitted me to the room, and the crook of Dr Watson's umbrella, I was able last night to fish up and inspect this bundle. </span>
<span sid='23023' title='23023'>It was of the first importance, however, that we should be able to prove who placed it there. </span>
<span sid='23024' title='23024'>This we accomplished by the very obvious device of announcing that the moat would be dried to-morrow, which had, of course, the effect that whoever had hidden the bundle would most certainly withdraw it the moment that darkness enabled him to do so. </span>
<span sid='23025' title='23025'>We have no fewer than four witnesses as to who it was who took advantage of the opportunity, and so, Mr Barker, I think the word lies now with you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23026' title='23026'>Sherlock Holmes put the sopping bundle upon the table beside the lamp and undid the cord which bound it. </span>
<span sid='23027' title='23027'>From within he extracted a dumb-bell, which he tossed down to its fellow in the corner. </span>
<span sid='23028' title='23028'>Next he drew forth a pair of boots. </span>
<span sid='23029' title='23029'>'<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n, as you perceive,' he remarked, pointing to the toes. </span>
<span sid='23030' title='23030'>Then he laid upon the table a long, deadly, sheathed knife. </span>
<span sid='23031' title='23031'>Finally he unravelled a bundle of clothing, comprising a complete set of underclothes, socks, a grey tweed suit, and a short yellow overcoat.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23032' title='23032'>'The clothes are commonplace,' remarked Holmes, 'save only the overcoat, which is full of suggestive touches.' </span>
<span sid='23033' title='23033'>He held it tenderly towards the light, whilst his long, thin fingers flickered over it. </span>
<span sid='23034' title='23034'>'Here, as you perceive, is the inner pocket prolonged into the lining in such a fashion as to give ample space for the truncated fowling-piece. </span>
<span sid='23035' title='23035'>The tailor's tab is on the neck - Neale, Outfitter, Vermissa, USA. </span>
<span sid='23036' title='23036'>I have spent an instructive afternoon in the rector's library, and have enlarged my knowledge by adding the fact that Vermissa is a flourishing little town at the head of one of the best-known coal and iron valleys in the United States. </span>
<span sid='23037' title='23037'>I have some recollection, Mr Barker, that you associated the coal districts with Mr Douglas's first wife, and it would surely not be too far-fetched an inference that the V. V. upon the card by the dead body might stand for Vermissa Valley, or that this very valley, which sends forth emissaries of murder, may be that Valley of Fear of which we have heard. </span>
<span sid='23038' title='23038'>So much is fairly clear. </span>
<span sid='23039' title='23039'>And now, Mr Barker, I seem to be standing rather in the way of your explanation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23040' title='23040'>It was a sight to see Cecil Barker's expressive face during this exposition of the great detective. </span>
<span sid='23041' title='23041'>Anger, amazement, consternation, and indecision swept over it in turn. </span>
<span sid='23042' title='23042'>Finally he took refuge in a somewhat acid irony.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23043' title='23043'>'You know such a lot, Mr Holmes, perhaps you had better tell us some more,' he sneered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23044' title='23044'>'I have no doubt that I could tell you a great deal more, Mr Barker, but it would come with a better grace from you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23045' title='23045'>'Oh, you think so, do you? </span>
<span sid='23046' title='23046'>Well, all I can say is that if there's any secret here it is not my secret, and I am not the man to give it away.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23047' title='23047'>'Well, if you take that line, Mr Barker,' said the inspector, quietly, 'we must just keep you in sight until we have the warrant and can hold you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23048' title='23048'>'You can do what you damn well please about that,' said Barker, defiantly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23049' title='23049'>The proceedings seemed to have come to a definite end so far as he was concerned, for one had only to look at that granite face to realize that no peine forte et dure would ever force him to plead against his will. </span>
<span sid='23050' title='23050'>The deadlock was broken, however, by a woman's voice. </span>
<span sid='23051' title='23051'>Mrs Douglas had been standing listening at the half-opened door, and now she entered the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23052' title='23052'>'You have done enough for us, Cecil,' said she. </span>
<span sid='23053' title='23053'>'Whatever comes of it in the future, you have done enough.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23054' title='23054'>'Enough and more than enough,' remarked Sherlock Holmes, gravely. </span>
<span sid='23055' title='23055'>'I have every sympathy with you, madam, and I should strongly urge you to have some confidence in the common sense of our jurisdiction and to take the police voluntarily into your complete confidence. </span>
<span sid='23056' title='23056'>It may be that I am myself at fault for not following up the hint which you conveyed to me through my friend, Dr Watson, but at that time I had every reason to believe that you were directly concerned in the crime. </span>
<span sid='23057' title='23057'>Now I am assured that this is not so. </span>
<span sid='23058' title='23058'>At the same time, there is much that is unexplained, and I should strongly recommend that you ask Mr Douglas to tell us his own story.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23059' title='23059'>Mrs Douglas gave a cry of astonishment at Holmes's words. </span>
<span sid='23060' title='23060'>The detectives and I must have echoed it, when we were aware of a man who seemed to have emerged from the wall, and who advanced now from the gloom of the corner in which he had appeared. </span>
<span sid='23061' title='23061'>Mrs Douglas turned, and in an instant her arms were round him. </span>
<span sid='23062' title='23062'>Barker had seized his outstretched hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23063' title='23063'>'It's best this way, Jack,' his wife repeated. </span>
<span sid='23064' title='23064'>'I am sure that it is best.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23065' title='23065'>'Indeed, yes, Mr Douglas,' said Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='23066' title='23066'>'I am sure that you will find it best.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23067' title='23067'>The man stood blinking at us with the dazed look of one who comes from the dark into the light. </span>
<span sid='23068' title='23068'>It was a remarkable face - bold grey eyes, a strong, short-clipped, grizzled moustache, a square, projecting chin, and a humorous mouth. </span>
<span sid='23069' title='23069'>He took a good look at us all, and then, to my amazement, he advanced to me and handed me a bundle of paper.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23070' title='23070'>'I've heard of you,' said he, in a voice which was not quite English and not quite <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n, but was altogether mellow and pleasing. </span>
<span sid='23071' title='23071'>'You are the historian of this bunch. </span>
<span sid='23072' title='23072'>Well, Dr Watson, you've never had such a story as that pass through your hands before, and I'd lay my last dollar on that. </span>
<span sid='23073' title='23073'>Tell it your own way, but there are the facts, and you can't miss the public so long as you have those. </span>
<span sid='23074' title='23074'>I've been cooped up two days, and I've spent the daylight hours - as much daylight as I could get in that rat-trap - in putting the thing into words. </span>
<span sid='23075' title='23075'>You're welcome to them - you and your public. </span>
<span sid='23076' title='23076'>There's the story of the Valley of Fear.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23077' title='23077'>'That's the past, Mr Douglas,' said Sherlock Holmes, quietly. </span>
<span sid='23078' title='23078'>'What we desire now is to hear your story of the present.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23079' title='23079'>'You'll have it, sir,' said Douglas. </span>
<span sid='23080' title='23080'>'Can I smoke as I talk? </span>
<span sid='23081' title='23081'>Well, thank you, Mr Holmes; you're a smoker yourself, if I remember right, and you'll guess what it is to be sitting for two days with tobacco in your pocket and afraid that the smell will give you away.' </span>
<span sid='23082' title='23082'>He leaned against the mantelpiece and sucked at the cigar which Holmes had handed him. </span>
<span sid='23083' title='23083'>'I've heard of you, Mr Holmes; I never guessed that I would meet you. </span>
<span sid='23084' title='23084'>But before you are through with that' - he nodded at my papers - 'you will say I've brought you something fresh.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23085' title='23085'>Inspector MacDonald had been staring at the newcomer with the greatest amazement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23086' title='23086'>'Well, this fairly beats me!' he cried at last. </span>
<span sid='23087' title='23087'>'If you are Mr John Douglas, of Birlstone Manor, then whose death have we been investigating for these two days, and where in the world have you sprung from now? </span>
<span sid='23088' title='23088'>You seemed to me to come out of the floor like a Jack-in-the-box.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23089' title='23089'>'Ah, Mr Mac,' said Holmes, shaking a reproving forefinger, 'you would not read that excellent local compilation which described the concealment of King Charles. </span>
<span sid='23090' title='23090'>People did not hide in those days without reliable hiding-places, and the hiding-place that has once been used may be again. </span>
<span sid='23091' title='23091'>I had persuaded myself that we should find Mr Douglas under this roof.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23092' title='23092'>'And how long have you been playing this trick upon us, Mr Holmes?' said the inspector, angrily. </span>
<span sid='23093' title='23093'>'How long have you allowed us to waste ourselves upon a search that you knew to be an absurd one?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23094' title='23094'>'Not one instant, my dear Mr Mac. </span>
<span sid='23095' title='23095'>Only last night did I form my views of the case. </span>
<span sid='23096' title='23096'>As they could not be put to the proof until this evening, I invited you and your colleague to take a holiday for the day. </span>
<span sid='23097' title='23097'>Pray, what more could I do? </span>
<span sid='23098' title='23098'>When I found the suit of clothes in the moat it at once became apparent to me that the body we had found could not have been the body of Mr John Douglas at all, but must be that of the bicyclist from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Tunbridge Wells&t=h'>Tunbridge Wells</a>. </span>
<span sid='23099' title='23099'>No other conclusion was possible. </span>
<span sid='23100' title='23100'>Therefore I had to determine where Mr John Douglas himself could be, and the balance of probability was that, with the connivance of his wife and his friend, he was concealed in a house which had such conveniences for a fugitive, and awaiting quieter times, when he could make his final escape.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23101' title='23101'>'Well, you figured it out about right,' said Mr Douglas, approvingly. </span>
<span sid='23102' title='23102'>'I thought I'd dodge your British law, for I was not sure how I stood under it, and also I saw my chance to throw these hounds once for all off my track. </span>
<span sid='23103' title='23103'>Mind you, from first to last I have done nothing to be ashamed of, and nothing that I would not do again, but you'll judge that for yourselves when I tell you my story. </span>
<span sid='23104' title='23104'>Never mind warning me, inspector; I'm ready to stand pat upon the truth.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23105' title='23105'>'I'm not going to begin at the beginning. </span>
<span sid='23106' title='23106'>That's all there' - he indicated my bundle of papers - 'and a mighty queer yarn you'll find it. </span>
<span sid='23107' title='23107'>It all comes down to this: That there are some men that have good cause to hate me and would give their last dollar to know that they had got me. </span>
<span sid='23108' title='23108'>So long as I am alive and they are alive, there is no safety in this world for me. </span>
<span sid='23109' title='23109'>They hunted me from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a> to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=California&t=h'>California</a>; then they chased me out of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>; but when I married and settled down in this quiet spot I thought my last years were going to be peaceable. </span>
<span sid='23110' title='23110'>I never explained to my wife how things were. </span>
<span sid='23111' title='23111'>Why should I pull her into it? </span>
<span sid='23112' title='23112'>She would never have a quiet moment again, but would be always imagining trouble. </span>
<span sid='23113' title='23113'>I fancy she knew something, for I may have dropped a word here or a word there - but until yesterday, after you gentlemen had seen her, she never knew the rights of the matter. </span>
<span sid='23114' title='23114'>She told you all she knew, and so did Barker here, for on the night when this thing happened there was mighty little time for explanations. </span>
<span sid='23115' title='23115'>She knows everything now, and I would have been a wiser man if I had told her sooner. </span>
<span sid='23116' title='23116'>But it was a hard question, dear' - he took her hand for an instant in his own - 'and I acted for the best.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23117' title='23117'>'Well, gentlemen, the day before these happenings I was over in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Tunbridge Wells&t=h'>Tunbridge Wells</a> and I got a glimpse of a man in the street. </span>
<span sid='23118' title='23118'>It was only a glimpse, but I have a quick eye for these things, and I never doubted who it was. </span>
<span sid='23119' title='23119'>It was the worst enemy I had among them all - one who has been after me like a hungry wolf after a caribou all these years. </span>
<span sid='23120' title='23120'>I knew there was trouble coming, and I came home and made ready for it. </span>
<span sid='23121' title='23121'>I guessed I'd fight through it all right on my own. </span>
<span sid='23122' title='23122'>There was a time when my luck was the talk of the whole United States. </span>
<span sid='23123' title='23123'>I never doubted that it would be with me still.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23124' title='23124'>'I was on my guard all that next day and never went out into the park. </span>
<span sid='23125' title='23125'>It's as well, or he'd have had the drop on me with that buck-shot gun of his before ever I could draw on him. </span>
<span sid='23126' title='23126'>After the bridge was up - my mind was always more restful when that bridge was up in the evenings - I put the thing clear out of my head. </span>
<span sid='23127' title='23127'>I never figured on his getting into the house and waiting for me. </span>
<span sid='23128' title='23128'>But when I made my round in my dressing-gown, as my habit was, I had no sooner entered the study than I scented danger. </span>
<span sid='23129' title='23129'>I guess when a man has had dangers in his life - and I've had more than most in my time - there is a kind of sixth sense that waves the red flag. </span>
<span sid='23130' title='23130'>I saw the signal clear enough, and yet I couldn't tell you why. </span>
<span sid='23131' title='23131'>Next instant I spotted a boot under the window curtain, and then I saw why plain enough.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23132' title='23132'>'I'd just the one candle that was in my hand, but there was a good light from the hall lamp through the open door. </span>
<span sid='23133' title='23133'>I put down the candle and jumped for a hammer that I'd left on the mantel. </span>
<span sid='23134' title='23134'>At the same moment he sprang at me. </span>
<span sid='23135' title='23135'>I saw the glint of a knife and I lashed at him with the hammer. </span>
<span sid='23136' title='23136'>I got him somewhere, for the knife tinkled down on the floor. </span>
<span sid='23137' title='23137'>He dodged round the table as quick as an eel, and a moment later he'd got his gun from under his coat. </span>
<span sid='23138' title='23138'>I heard him cock it, but I had got hold of it before he could fire. </span>
<span sid='23139' title='23139'>I had it by the barrel, and we wrestled for it all ends up for a minute or more. </span>
<span sid='23140' title='23140'>It was death to the man that lost his grip. </span>
<span sid='23141' title='23141'>He never lost his grip, but he got it butt downwards for a moment too long. </span>
<span sid='23142' title='23142'>Maybe it was I that pulled the trigger. </span>
<span sid='23143' title='23143'>Maybe we just jolted it off between us. </span>
<span sid='23144' title='23144'>Anyhow, he got both barrels in the face, and there I was, staring down at all that was left of Ted Baldwin. </span>
<span sid='23145' title='23145'>I'd recognized him in the township and again when he sprang for me, but his own mother wouldn't recognize him as I saw him then. </span>
<span sid='23146' title='23146'>I'm used to rough work, but I fairly turned sick at the sight of him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23147' title='23147'>'I was hanging on to the side of the table when Barker came hurrying down. </span>
<span sid='23148' title='23148'>I heard my wife coming, and I ran to the door and stopped her. </span>
<span sid='23149' title='23149'>It was no sight for a woman. </span>
<span sid='23150' title='23150'>I promised I'd come to her soon. </span>
<span sid='23151' title='23151'>I said a word or two to Barker - he took it all in at a glance - and we waited for the rest to come along. </span>
<span sid='23152' title='23152'>But there was no sign of them. </span>
<span sid='23153' title='23153'>Then we understood that they could hear nothing, and that all that had happened was only known to ourselves.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23154' title='23154'>'It was at that instant that the idea came to me. </span>
<span sid='23155' title='23155'>I was fairly dazzled by the brilliancy of it. </span>
<span sid='23156' title='23156'>The man's sleeve had slipped up and there was the branded mark of the Lodge upon his forearm. </span>
<span sid='23157' title='23157'>See here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23158' title='23158'>The man whom we knew as Douglas turned up his own coat and cuff to show a brown triangle within a circle exactly like that which we had seen upon the dead man.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23159' title='23159'>'It was the sight of that which started me on to it. </span>
<span sid='23160' title='23160'>I seemed to see it all clear at a glance. </span>
<span sid='23161' title='23161'>There was his height and hair and figure about the same as my own. </span>
<span sid='23162' title='23162'>No one could swear to his face, poor devil! </span>
<span sid='23163' title='23163'>I brought down this suit of clothes, and in a quarter of an hour Barker and I had put my dressing-gown on him and he lay as you found him. </span>
<span sid='23164' title='23164'>We tied all his things into a bundle, and I weighted them with the only weight I could find and slung them through the window. </span>
<span sid='23165' title='23165'>The card he had meant to lay upon my body was lying beside his own. </span>
<span sid='23166' title='23166'>My rings were put on his finger, but when it came to the wedding-ring' - he held out his muscular hand - 'you can see for yourselves that I had struck my limit. </span>
<span sid='23167' title='23167'>I have not moved it since the day I was married, and it would have taken a file to get it off. </span>
<span sid='23168' title='23168'>I don't know, anyhow, that I would have cared to part with it, but if I had wanted to I couldn't. </span>
<span sid='23169' title='23169'>So we just had to leave the detail to take care of itself. </span>
<span sid='23170' title='23170'>On the other hand, I brought a bit of plaster down and put it where I am wearing one myself at this instant. </span>
<span sid='23171' title='23171'>You slipped up there, Mr Holmes, clever as you are, for if you had chanced to take off that plaster you would have Found no cut underneath it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23172' title='23172'>'Well, that was the situation. </span>
<span sid='23173' title='23173'>If I could lie low for a while and then get away where I would be joined by my wife, we would have a chance at last of living at peace for the rest of our lives. </span>
<span sid='23174' title='23174'>These devils would give me no rest so long as I was above-ground but if they saw in the papers that Baldwin had got his man there would be an end of all my troubles. </span>
<span sid='23175' title='23175'>I hadn't much time to make it clear to Barker and to my wife, but they understood enough to be able to help me. </span>
<span sid='23176' title='23176'>I knew all about this hiding-place, so did Ames, but it never entered his head to connect it with the matter. </span>
<span sid='23177' title='23177'>I retired into it, and it was up to Barker to do the rest.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23178' title='23178'>'I guess you can fill in for yourselves what he did. </span>
<span sid='23179' title='23179'>He opened the window and made the mark on the sill to give an idea of how the murderer escaped. </span>
<span sid='23180' title='23180'>It was a tall order, that, but as the bridge was up there was no other way. </span>
<span sid='23181' title='23181'>Then, when everything was fixed, he rang the bell for all he was worth. </span>
<span sid='23182' title='23182'>What happened afterwards you know - and so, gentlemen, you can do what you please, but I've told you the truth and the whole truth, so help me, God! </span>
<span sid='23183' title='23183'>What I ask you now is, how do I stand by the English law?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23184' title='23184'>There was a silence, which was broken by Sherlock Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23185' title='23185'>'The English law is, in the main, a just law. </span>
<span sid='23186' title='23186'>You will get no worse than your deserts from that, Mr Douglas. </span>
<span sid='23187' title='23187'>But I would ask you how did this man know that you lived here, how to get into your house, or where to hide to get you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23188' title='23188'>'I know nothing of this.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23189' title='23189'>Holmes's face was very white and grave.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23190' title='23190'>'The story is not over yet, I fear,' said he. </span>
<span sid='23191' title='23191'>'You may find worse dangers than the English law, or even than your enemies from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>. </span>
<span sid='23192' title='23192'>I see trouble before you, Mr Douglas. </span>
<span sid='23193' title='23193'>You'll take my advice and still be on your guard.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23194' title='23194'>And now, my long-suffering readers, I will ask you to come away with me for a time, far from the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sussex&t=h'>Sussex</a> Manor House of Birlstone, and far also from the year of grace in which we made our eventful journey which ended with the strange story of the man who had been known as John Douglas. </span>
<span sid='23195' title='23195'>I wish you to journey back some twenty years in time, and westward some thousands of miles in space, that I may lay before you a singular and a terrible narrative - so singular and so terrible that you may find it hard to believe that, even as I tell it, even so did it occur.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23196' title='23196'>Do not think that I intrude one story before another is finished. </span>
<span sid='23197' title='23197'>As you read on you will find that this is not so. </span>
<span sid='23198' title='23198'>And when I have detailed those distant events and you have solved this mystery of the past, we shall meet once more in those rooms in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> where this, like so many other wonderful happenings, will find its end.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23199' title='23199'>PART 2 : The Scowrers</span>
<p>
<span sid='23200' title='23200'>CHAPTER 1 : The Man</span>
<p>
<span sid='23201' title='23201'>It was the fourth of February in the year 1875. </span>
<span sid='23202' title='23202'>It had I been a severe winter, and the snow lay deep in the gorges of the Gilmerton Mountains. </span>
<span sid='23203' title='23203'>The steam plough had, however, kept the rail-track open, and the evening train which connects the long line of coal-mining and iron-working settlements was slowly groaning its way up the steep gradients which lead from Stagville on the plain to Vermissa, the central township which lies at the head of the Vermissa Valley. </span>
<span sid='23204' title='23204'>From this point the track sweeps downwards to Barton's Crossing, Helmdale, and the purely agricultural county of Merton. </span>
<span sid='23205' title='23205'>It was a single-track railroad, but at every siding - and they were numerous - long lines of trucks piled with coal and with iron ore told of the hidden wealth which had brought a rude population and a bustling life to this most desolate corner of the United States of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23206' title='23206'>For desolate it was! </span>
<span sid='23207' title='23207'>Little could the first pioneer who had traversed it have ever imagined that the fairest prairies and the most lush water-pastures were valueless compared with this gloomy land of black crag and tangled forest. </span>
<span sid='23208' title='23208'>Above the dark and often scarcely penetrable woods upon their sides, the high, bare crowns of the mountains, white snow and jagged rock, towered upon either flank, leaving a long, winding, tortuous valley in the centre. </span>
<span sid='23209' title='23209'>Up this the little train was slowly crawling.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23210' title='23210'>The oil lamps had just been lit in the leading passenger-car, a long, bare carriage in which some twenty or thirty people were seated. </span>
<span sid='23211' title='23211'>The greater number of these were workmen returning from their day's toil in the lower portion of the valley. </span>
<span sid='23212' title='23212'>At least a dozen, by their grimed faces and the safety lanterns which they carried, proclaimed themselves as miners. </span>
<span sid='23213' title='23213'>These sat smoking in a group, and conversed in low voices, glancing occasionally at two men on the opposite side of the car, whose uniform and badges showed them to be policemen.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23214' title='23214'>Several women of the labouring class, and one or two travellers who might have been small local storekeepers, made up the rest of the company, with the exception of one young man in a corner by himself. </span>
<span sid='23215' title='23215'>It is with this man that we are concerned. </span>
<span sid='23216' title='23216'>Take a good look at him, for he is worth it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23217' title='23217'>He is a fresh-complexioned, middle-sized young man, not far, one would guess, from his thirtieth year. </span>
<span sid='23218' title='23218'>He has large, shrewd, humorous grey eyes which twinkle inquiringly from time to time as he looks round through his spectacles at the people about him. </span>
<span sid='23219' title='23219'>It is easy to see that he is of a sociable and possibly simple disposition, anxious to be friendly to all men. </span>
<span sid='23220' title='23220'>Anyone could pick him at once as gregarious in his habits and communicative in his nature, with a quick wit and a ready smile. </span>
<span sid='23221' title='23221'>And yet the man who studied him more closely might discern a certain firmness of jaw and grim tightness about the lips which would warn him that there were depths beyond, and that this pleasant, brown-haired young Irishman might conceivably leave his mark for good or evil upon any society to which he was introduced.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23222' title='23222'>Having made one or two tentative remarks to the nearest miner, and received only short, gruff replies, the traveller resigned himself to uncongenial silence, staring moodily out of the window at the fading landscape.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23223' title='23223'>It was not a cheering prospect. </span>
<span sid='23224' title='23224'>Through the growing gloom there pulsed the red glow of the furnaces on the sides of the hills. </span>
<span sid='23225' title='23225'>Great heaps of slag and dumps of cinders loomed up on each side, with the high shafts of the collieries towering above them. </span>
<span sid='23226' title='23226'>Huddled groups of mean, wooden houses, the windows of which were beginning to outline themselves in light, were scattered here and there along the line, and the frequent halting-places were crowded with their swarthy inhabitants.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23227' title='23227'>The iron and coal valleys of the Vermissa district were no resorts for the leisured or the cultured. </span>
<span sid='23228' title='23228'>Everywhere there were stern signs of the crudest battle of life, the rude work to be done, and the rude, strong workers who did it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23229' title='23229'>The young traveller gazed out into this dismal country with a face of mingled repulsion and interest, which showed that the scene was new to him. </span>
<span sid='23230' title='23230'>At intervals he drew from his pocket a bulky letter to which he referred, and on the margins of which he scribbled some notes. </span>
<span sid='23231' title='23231'>Once from the back of his waist he produced something which one would hardly have expected to find in the possession of so mild- mannered a man. </span>
<span sid='23232' title='23232'>It was a navy revolver of the largest size. </span>
<span sid='23233' title='23233'>As he turned it slantwise to the light, the glint upon the rims of the copper shells within the drum showed that it was fully loaded. </span>
<span sid='23234' title='23234'>He quickly restored it to his secret pocket, but not before it had been observed by a working man who had seated himself upon the adjoining bench.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23235' title='23235'>'Hullo, Mate!' said he. </span>
<span sid='23236' title='23236'>'You seem heeled and ready.' </span>
<span sid='23237' title='23237'>The young man smiled with an air of embarrassment. </span>
<span sid='23238' title='23238'>'Yes,' said he, 'we need them sometimes in the place I come from.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23239' title='23239'>'And where may that be?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23240' title='23240'>'I'm last from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23241' title='23241'>'A stranger in these parts?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23242' title='23242'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23243' title='23243'>'You may find you need it here,' said the workman. </span>
<span sid='23244' title='23244'>'Ah! </span>
<span sid='23245' title='23245'>Is that so?' </span>
<span sid='23246' title='23246'>The young man seemed interested. </span>
<span sid='23247' title='23247'>'Have you heard nothing of doings hereabouts?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23248' title='23248'>'Nothing out of the way.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23249' title='23249'>'Why, I thought the country was full of it. </span>
<span sid='23250' title='23250'>You'll hear quick enough. </span>
<span sid='23251' title='23251'>What made you come here?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23252' title='23252'>'I heard there was always work for a willing man.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23253' title='23253'>'Are you a member of the union?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23254' title='23254'>'Sure.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23255' title='23255'>'Then you'll get your job, I guess. </span>
<span sid='23256' title='23256'>Have you any friends?' </span>
<span sid='23257' title='23257'>'Not yet, but I have the means of making them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23258' title='23258'>'How's that, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23259' title='23259'>'I am one of the Ancient Order of Freemen. </span>
<span sid='23260' title='23260'>There's no town without a lodge, and where there is a lodge I'll find my friends.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23261' title='23261'>The remark had a singular effect upon his companion. </span>
<span sid='23262' title='23262'>He glanced round suspiciously at the others in the car. </span>
<span sid='23263' title='23263'>The miners were still whispering among themselves. </span>
<span sid='23264' title='23264'>The two police-officers were dozing. </span>
<span sid='23265' title='23265'>He came across, seated himself close to the young traveller, and held out his hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23266' title='23266'>'Put it there,' he said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23267' title='23267'>A hand-grip passed between the two.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23268' title='23268'>'I see you speak the truth. </span>
<span sid='23269' title='23269'>But it's well to make certain.' </span>
<span sid='23270' title='23270'>He raised his right hand to his right eyebrow. </span>
<span sid='23271' title='23271'>The traveller at once raised his left hand to his left eyebrow.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23272' title='23272'>'Dark nights arc unpleasant,' said the workman. </span>
<span sid='23273' title='23273'>'Yes, for strangers to travel,' the other answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23274' title='23274'>'That's good enough. </span>
<span sid='23275' title='23275'>I'm Brother Scanlan, Lodge 341, Vermissa Valley. </span>
<span sid='23276' title='23276'>Glad to see you in these parts.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23277' title='23277'>'Thank you. </span>
<span sid='23278' title='23278'>I'm Brother John McMurdo, Lodge 29, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>. </span>
<span sid='23279' title='23279'>Bodymaster, J. H. Scott. </span>
<span sid='23280' title='23280'>But I am in luck to meet a brother so early.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23281' title='23281'>'Well, there are plenty of us about. </span>
<span sid='23282' title='23282'>You won't find the Order more flourishing anywhere in the States than right here in Vermissa Valley. </span>
<span sid='23283' title='23283'>But we could do with some lads like you. </span>
<span sid='23284' title='23284'>I can't understand a spry man of the union finding no work to do in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23285' title='23285'>'I found plenty of work to do,' said McMurdo.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23286' title='23286'>'Then why did you leave?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23287' title='23287'>McMurdo nodded towards the policemen and smiled. </span>
<span sid='23288' title='23288'>'I guess those chaps would be glad to know,' he said. </span>
<span sid='23289' title='23289'>Scanlan groaned sympathetically. </span>
<span sid='23290' title='23290'>'In trouble?' he asked in a whisper.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23291' title='23291'>'Deep.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23292' title='23292'>'A penitentiary job?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23293' title='23293'>'And the rest.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23294' title='23294'>'Not a killing!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23295' title='23295'>'It's early days to talk of such things,' said McMurdo, with the air of a man who had been surprised into saying more than he intended. </span>
<span sid='23296' title='23296'>'I've my own good reasons for leaving <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>, and let that be enough for you. </span>
<span sid='23297' title='23297'>Who are you that you should take it on yourself to ask such things?' </span>
<span sid='23298' title='23298'>His grey eyes gleamed with sudden and dangerous anger from behind his glasses.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23299' title='23299'>'All right, Mate. </span>
<span sid='23300' title='23300'>No offence meant. </span>
<span sid='23301' title='23301'>The boys will think none the worse of you whatever you may have done. </span>
<span sid='23302' title='23302'>Where are you bound for now?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23303' title='23303'>'Vermissa.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23304' title='23304'>'That's the third halt down the Line. </span>
<span sid='23305' title='23305'>Where are you staying?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23306' title='23306'>McMurdo took out an envelope and held it close to the murky oil lamp. </span>
<span sid='23307' title='23307'>'Here is the address - Jacob Shafter, Sheridan Street. </span>
<span sid='23308' title='23308'>It's a boarding-house that was recommended by a man I knew in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23309' title='23309'>'Well, I don't know it, but Vermissa is out of my beat. </span>
<span sid='23310' title='23310'>I live at Hobson's Patch, and that's here where we are drawing up. </span>
<span sid='23311' title='23311'>But, say, there's one bit of advice give you before we part: </span>
<span sid='23312' title='23312'>If you're in trouble in Vermissa, go straight to the Union House and see Boss McGinty. </span>
<span sid='23313' title='23313'>He is the bodymaster of Vermissa Lodge, and nothing can happen in these parts unless Black Jack McGinty wants it. </span>
<span sid='23314' title='23314'>So long, Mate. </span>
<span sid='23315' title='23315'>Maybe we'll meet in Lodge one of these evenings. </span>
<span sid='23316' title='23316'>But mind my words: </span>
<span sid='23317' title='23317'>If you are in trouble, go to Boss McGinty.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23318' title='23318'>Scanlan descended, and McMurdo was left once again to his thoughts. </span>
<span sid='23319' title='23319'>Night had now fallen, and the flames of the frequent furnaces were roaring and leaping in the darkness. </span>
<span sid='23320' title='23320'>Against their lurid background dark figures were bending and straining, twisting, and turning, with the motion of winch or of windlass, to the rhythm of an eternal clank and roar.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23321' title='23321'>'I guess hell must look something like that,' said a voice.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23322' title='23322'>McMurdo turned and saw that one of the policemen had shifted in his seat and was staring out into the fiery waste.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23323' title='23323'>Tor that matter,' said the other policeman, 'I allow that hell must be something like that. </span>
<span sid='23324' title='23324'>If there are worse devils down yonder than some we could name, it's more than I'd expect. </span>
<span sid='23325' title='23325'>I guess you are new to this part, young man?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23326' title='23326'>'Well, what if I am?' McMurdo answered, in a surly voice.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23327' title='23327'>'Just this, Mister; that I should advise you to be careful in choosing your friends. </span>
<span sid='23328' title='23328'>I don't think I'd begin with Mike Scanlan or his gang if I were you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23329' title='23329'>'What the hell is it to you who are my friends?' </span>
<span sid='23330' title='23330'>roared McMurdo, in a voice which brought every head in the carriage round to witness the altercation. </span>
<span sid='23331' title='23331'>'Did I ask you for your advice, or did you think me such a sucker that couldn't move without it? </span>
<span sid='23332' title='23332'>You speak when you are spoken to, and by the Lord you'd have to wait a long time if it was me!' </span>
<span sid='23333' title='23333'>He thrust out his face, and grinned at the patrolmen like a snarling dog.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23334' title='23334'>The two policemen, heavy, good-natured men, were taken aback by the extraordinary vehemence with which their friendly advances had been rejected.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23335' title='23335'>'No offence, Stranger,' said one. </span>
<span sid='23336' title='23336'>'It was a warning for your own good, seeing that you are, by your own showing, new to the place.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23337' title='23337'>'I'm new to the place; but I'm not new to you and your kind!' cried McMurdo, in a cold fury. </span>
<span sid='23338' title='23338'>'I guess you're the same in all places, shoving your advice in when nobody asks for it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23339' title='23339'>'Maybe we'll see more of you before very long,' said one of the patrolmen, with a grin. </span>
<span sid='23340' title='23340'>'You're a real hand-picked one, if I am a judge.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23341' title='23341'>'I was thinking the same,' remarked the other. </span>
<span sid='23342' title='23342'>'I guess we may meet again.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23343' title='23343'>'I'm not afraid of you, and don't you think it!' cried McMurdo. </span>
<span sid='23344' title='23344'>'My name's Jack McMurdo - see? </span>
<span sid='23345' title='23345'>If you want me you'll find me at Jacob Shafter's, on Sheridan Street, Vermissa; so I'm not hiding from you, am I? </span>
<span sid='23346' title='23346'>Day or night dare to look the like of you in the face - don't make any mistake about that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23347' title='23347'>There was a murmur of sympathy and admiration from the miners at the dauntless demeanour of the new-corner, while the two policemen shrugged their shoulders and renewed a conversation between themselves.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23348' title='23348'>A few minutes later the train ran into the ill-lit station and there was a general clearing, for Vermissa was by far the largest town on the line. </span>
<span sid='23349' title='23349'>McMurdo picked up his leather grip-sack, and was about to start off into the darkness, when one of the miners accosted hi.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23350' title='23350'>'By Gar, Mate, you know how to speak to the cops,' he said, in a voice of awe. </span>
<span sid='23351' title='23351'>'It was grand to hear you. </span>
<span sid='23352' title='23352'>Let me carry your grip and show you the road. </span>
<span sid='23353' title='23353'>I'm passing Shafter's on the way to my own shack.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23354' title='23354'>There was a chorus of friendly 'Good-nights' from the other miners as they passed from the platform. </span>
<span sid='23355' title='23355'>Before ever he had set foot in it, McMurdo the turbulent had become a character in Vermissa.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23356' title='23356'>The country had been a place of terror, but the town was in its way even more depressing. </span>
<span sid='23357' title='23357'>Down that long valley there was at least a certain gloomy grandeur in the huge fires and the clouds of drifting smoke, while the strength and industry of man found fitting monuments in the hills which he had spilled by the side of his monstrous excavations. </span>
<span sid='23358' title='23358'>But the town showed a dead level of mean ugliness and squalor. </span>
<span sid='23359' title='23359'>The broad street was churned up by the traffic into a horrible rutted paste of muddy snow. </span>
<span sid='23360' title='23360'>The sidewalks were narrow and uneven. </span>
<span sid='23361' title='23361'>The numerous gas-lamps served only to show more clearly a long line of wooden houses, each with its veranda facing the street, unkempt and dirty.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23362' title='23362'>As they approached the centre of the town, the scene was brightened by a row of well-lit stores, and even more by a cluster of liquor saloons and gaming-houses, in which the miners spent their hard-earned but generous wages.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23363' title='23363'>'That's the Union House,' said the guide, pointing to one saloon which rose almost to the dignity of being an hotel. </span>
<span sid='23364' title='23364'>'Jack McGinty is the Boss there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23365' title='23365'>'What sort of a man is he?' McMurdo asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23366' title='23366'>'What! </span>
<span sid='23367' title='23367'>Have you never heard of the Boss?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23368' title='23368'>'How could I have heard of him when you know that am a stranger in these parts?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23369' title='23369'>'Well, I thought his name was known clear across the country. </span>
<span sid='23370' title='23370'>It's been in the papers often enough.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23371' title='23371'>'What for?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23372' title='23372'>'Well' - the miner lowered his voice - 'over the affairs.' </span>
<span sid='23373' title='23373'>'What affairs?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23374' title='23374'>'Good Lord, Mister! you are queer, if I must say it without offence. </span>
<span sid='23375' title='23375'>There's only one set of affairs that you'll hear of in these parts, and that's the affairs of the Scowrers.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23376' title='23376'>'Why, I seem to have read of the Scowrers in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>. </span>
<span sid='23377' title='23377'>A gang of murderers, are they not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23378' title='23378'>'Hush, on your life!' cried the miner, standing still in his alarm, and gazing in amazement at his companion. </span>
<span sid='23379' title='23379'>'Man, you won't live long in these parts if you speak in the open street like that. </span>
<span sid='23380' title='23380'>Many a man has had the life beaten out of him for less.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23381' title='23381'>'Well, I know nothing about them. </span>
<span sid='23382' title='23382'>It's only what I have read.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23383' title='23383'>'And I'm not saying that you have not read the truth.' </span>
<span sid='23384' title='23384'>The man looked nervously round him as he spoke, peering into the shadows as if he feared to see some lurking danger. </span>
<span sid='23385' title='23385'>'If killing is murder, then God knows there is murder and to spare. </span>
<span sid='23386' title='23386'>But don't you dare breathe the name of Jack McGinty in connection with it, Stranger; for every whisper goes back to him, and he is not one that is likely to let it pass. </span>
<span sid='23387' title='23387'>Now, that's the house you're after, that one standing back from the street. </span>
<span sid='23388' title='23388'>You'll find old Jacob Shafter that runs it as honest a man as lives in this township.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23389' title='23389'>'I thank you,' said McMurdo, and shaking hands with his new acquaintance he plodded, his grip-sack in his hand, up the path which led to the dwelling-house, at the door of which he gave a resounding knock. </span>
<span sid='23390' title='23390'>It was opened at once by someone very different from what he had expected.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23391' title='23391'>It was a woman, young and singularly beautiful. </span>
<span sid='23392' title='23392'>She was of the German type, blonde and fair-haired, with the piquant contrast of a pair of beautiful dark eyes; with which she surveyed the stranger with surprise and a pleasing embarrassment which brought a wave of colour over her pale face. </span>
<span sid='23393' title='23393'>Framed in the bright light of the open doorway, it seemed to McMurdo that he had never seen a more beautiful picture, the more attractive for its contrast with the sordid and gloomy surroundings. </span>
<span sid='23394' title='23394'>A lovely violet growing upon one of those black slag-heaps of the mines would not have seemed more surprising. </span>
<span sid='23395' title='23395'>So entranced was he that he stood staring without a word, and it was she who broke the silence.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23396' title='23396'>'I thought it was father,' said she, with a pleasing little touch of a German accent. </span>
<span sid='23397' title='23397'>'Did you come to see him? </span>
<span sid='23398' title='23398'>He is down town. </span>
<span sid='23399' title='23399'>I expect him back every minute.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23400' title='23400'>McMurdo continued to gaze at her in open admiration until her eyes dropped in confusion before this masterful visitor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23401' title='23401'>'No, miss,' he said at last; 'I'm in no hurry to see him. </span>
<span sid='23402' title='23402'>But your house was recommended to me for board. </span>
<span sid='23403' title='23403'>I thought it might suit me - and now I know it will.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23404' title='23404'>'You are quick to make up your mind,' said she, with a smile.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23405' title='23405'>'Anyone but a blind man could do as much,' the other answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23406' title='23406'>She laughed at the compliment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23407' title='23407'>'Come right in, sir,' she said. </span>
<span sid='23408' title='23408'>'I'm Miss Ettie Shafter, Mr Shafter's daughter. </span>
<span sid='23409' title='23409'>My mother's dead, and I run the house. </span>
<span sid='23410' title='23410'>You can sit down by the stove in the front room until father comes along - Ah, here he is! </span>
<span sid='23411' title='23411'>So you can fix things with him right away.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23412' title='23412'>A heavy, elderly man came plodding up the path. </span>
<span sid='23413' title='23413'>In a few words McMurdo explained his business. </span>
<span sid='23414' title='23414'>A man of the name of Murphy had given him the address in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>. </span>
<span sid='23415' title='23415'>He in turn had had it from someone else. </span>
<span sid='23416' title='23416'>Old Shafter was quite ready. </span>
<span sid='23417' title='23417'>The stranger made no bones about terms, agreed at once to every condition, and was apparently fairly flush of money. </span>
<span sid='23418' title='23418'>For seven dollars a week, paid in advance, he was to have board and lodging. </span>
<span sid='23419' title='23419'>So it was that McMurdo, the self-confessed fugitive from justice, took up his abode under the roof of the Shafters, the first step which was to lead to so long and dark a train of events, ending in a far distant land.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23420' title='23420'>CHAPTER 2 : The Bodymaster</span>
<p>
<span sid='23421' title='23421'>McMurdo was a man who made his mark quickly. </span>
<span sid='23422' title='23422'>Wherever he was the folk around soon knew it. </span>
<span sid='23423' title='23423'>Within a week he had become infinitely the most important person at Shafter's. </span>
<span sid='23424' title='23424'>There were ten or a dozen boarders there, but they were honest foremen or commonplace clerks from the stores, of a very different calibre to the young Irishman. </span>
<span sid='23425' title='23425'>Of an evening when they gathered together his joke was always the readiest, his conversation the brightest, and his song the best. </span>
<span sid='23426' title='23426'>He was a born boon companion, with a magnetism which drew good humour from ah l around him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23427' title='23427'>And yet he showed again and again, as he had shown in the railway-carriage, a capacity for sudden, fierce anger which compelled the respect and even the fear of those who met him. </span>
<span sid='23428' title='23428'>For the law, too, and all connected with it, he exhibited a bitter contempt which delighted some and alarmed others of his fellow-boarders.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23429' title='23429'>From the first he made it evident, by his open admiration, that the daughter of the house had won his heart from the instant that he had set eyes upon her beauty and her grace. </span>
<span sid='23430' title='23430'>He was no backward suitor. </span>
<span sid='23431' title='23431'>On the second day he told her that he loved her, and from then onwards he repeated the same story with an absolute disregard of what she might say to discourage him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23432' title='23432'>'Someone else?' he would cry. </span>
<span sid='23433' title='23433'>'Well, the worse luck for someone else! </span>
<span sid='23434' title='23434'>Let him look out for himself!. </span>
<span sid='23435' title='23435'>Am I to lose my life's chance and all my heart's desire for someone else? </span>
<span sid='23436' title='23436'>You can keep on saying no, Ettie! </span>
<span sid='23437' title='23437'>The day will come when you will say yes, and I'm young enough to wait.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23438' title='23438'>He was a dangerous suitor, with his glib Irish tongue and his pretty, coaxing ways. </span>
<span sid='23439' title='23439'>There was about him also that glamour of experience and of mystery which attracts a woman's interest and finally her love. </span>
<span sid='23440' title='23440'>He could talk of the sweet valleys of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=County Monaghan&t=h'>County Monaghan</a>&t=h'><a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=County Monaghan&t=h'>County Monaghan</a></a> from which he came, of the lovely distant island, the low hills and green meadows of which seemed the more beautiful when imagination viewed them from this place of grime and snow.</span>
<span sid='23441' title='23441'>Then he was versed in the life of the cities of the North, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Detroit&t=h'>Detroit</a> and the lumber-camps of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Michigan&t=h'>Michigan</a>, of Buffalo, and finally of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>, where he had worked in a planing mill. </span>
<span sid='23442' title='23442'>And afterwards came the hint of romance, the feeling that strange things had happened to him in that great city, so strange and so intimate that they might not be spoken of. </span>
<span sid='23443' title='23443'>He spoke wistfully of a sudden leaving, a breaking of old tics, a flight into a strange world ending in this dreary valley, and Ettie listened, her dark eyes gleaming with pity and with sympathy - those two qualities which may turn so rapidly and so naturally to love.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23444' title='23444'>McMurdo had obtained a temporary job as a book-keeper, for he was a well-educated man. </span>
<span sid='23445' title='23445'>This kept him out most of the day, and he had not found occasion yet to report himself to the head of the Lodge of the Ancient Order of Freemen. </span>
<span sid='23446' title='23446'>He was reminded of his omission, however, by a visit one evening from Mike Scanlan, the fellow-member whom he had met in the train. </span>
<span sid='23447' title='23447'>Scanlan, a small, sharp-faced, nervous, black-eyed man, seemed glad to see him once more. </span>
<span sid='23448' title='23448'>After a glass or two of whiskey, he broached the object of his visit.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23449' title='23449'>Say, McMurdo,' said he, 'I remembered your address, so I made bold to cal I'm surprised that you've not reported to the Bodymaster. </span>
<span sid='23450' title='23450'>Why haven't you seen Boss McGinty yet?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23451' title='23451'>'Well, I had to find a job. </span>
<span sid='23452' title='23452'>I have been busy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23453' title='23453'>'You must find time for him if you have none for anything else. </span>
<span sid='23454' title='23454'>Good Lord, man! you're a fool not to have been down to the Union House and registered your name the first morning after you came here! </span>
<span sid='23455' title='23455'>If you run against him -  well, you mustn't - that's all!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23456' title='23456'>McMurdo showed mild surprise. </span>
<span sid='23457' title='23457'>I've been a member of Lodge for over two years, Scanlan, but I never heard that duties were so pressing as all that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23458' title='23458'>'Maybe not in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23459' title='23459'>'Well, it's the same society here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23460' title='23460'>'Is it?' </span>
<span sid='23461' title='23461'>Scanlan looked at him long and fixedly. </span>
<span sid='23462' title='23462'>There was something sinister in his eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23463' title='23463'>'Isn't it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23464' title='23464'>'You'll tell me that in a month's time. </span>
<span sid='23465' title='23465'>I hear you had a talk with the patrolmen after I left the train.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23466' title='23466'>'How did you know that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23467' title='23467'>'Oh, it got about - things do get about for good and for bad in this district.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23468' title='23468'>'Well, yes. </span>
<span sid='23469' title='23469'>I told the hounds what I thought of them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23470' title='23470'>'By the Lord, you'll be a man after McGinty's heart!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23471' title='23471'>'What - does he hate the police, too?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23472' title='23472'>Scanlan burst out laughing.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23473' title='23473'>'You go and see him, my lad,' said he, as he took his leave. </span>
<span sid='23474' title='23474'>'It's not the police but you that he'll hate if you don't! </span>
<span sid='23475' title='23475'>Now, take a friend's advice and go at once!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23476' title='23476'>It chanced that on the same evening McMurdo had another more pressing interview which urged him in the same direction. </span>
<span sid='23477' title='23477'>It may have been that his attentions to Ettie had been more evident than before, or that they had gradually obtruded themselves into the slow mind of his good German host; but, whatever the cause, the boarding-house keeper beckoned the young man into his private room and started on to the subject without any circumlocution.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23478' title='23478'>'It seems to me, Mister,' said he, 'that you are gettin' set on my Ettie. </span>
<span sid='23479' title='23479'>Ain't that so, or am I wrong?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23480' title='23480'>'Yes, that is so,' the young man answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23481' title='23481'>'Vell, I want to tell you right now that it ain't no manner of use. </span>
<span sid='23482' title='23482'>There's someone slipped in afore you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23483' title='23483'>'She told me so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23484' title='23484'>'Vell, you can lay that she told you truth! </span>
<span sid='23485' title='23485'>But did she tell you who it vas?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23486' title='23486'>'No; I asked her, but she wouldn't tell.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23487' title='23487'>'I dare say not, the leetle baggage! </span>
<span sid='23488' title='23488'>Perhaps she did not vish to frighten you avay.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23489' title='23489'>'Frighten!' </span>
<span sid='23490' title='23490'>McMurdo was on fire in a moment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23491' title='23491'>'Ah, yes, my friend! </span>
<span sid='23492' title='23492'>You need not be ashamed to be frightened of him. </span>
<span sid='23493' title='23493'>It is Teddy Baldwin.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23494' title='23494'>'And who the devil is he?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23495' title='23495'>'He is a Boss of Scowrers.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23496' title='23496'>'Scowrers! </span>
<span sid='23497' title='23497'>I've heard of them before. </span>
<span sid='23498' title='23498'>It's Scowrers here and Scowrers there, and always in a whisper! </span>
<span sid='23499' title='23499'>What are you all afraid of? </span>
<span sid='23500' title='23500'>Who are the Scowrers?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23501' title='23501'>The boarding-house keeper instinctively sank his voice, as everyone did who talked about the terrible society.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23502' title='23502'>The Scowrers,' said he, 'are the Ancient Order of Freemen.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23503' title='23503'>The young man started. </span>
<span sid='23504' title='23504'>'Why, I am a member of that Order myself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23505' title='23505'>'You! </span>
<span sid='23506' title='23506'>I would never have had you in my house if I had known it - not if you vere to pay me a hundred dollar a veek.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23507' title='23507'>'What's amiss with the Order? </span>
<span sid='23508' title='23508'>It's for charity and good fellowship. </span>
<span sid='23509' title='23509'>The rules say so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23510' title='23510'>'Maybe in some places. </span>
<span sid='23511' title='23511'>Not here!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23512' title='23512'>'What is it here?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23513' title='23513'>'It's a murder society, that's vat it is.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23514' title='23514'>McMurdo laughed incredulously.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23515' title='23515'>'How do you prove that?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23516' title='23516'>'Prove it! </span>
<span sid='23517' title='23517'>Are there not fifty murders to prove it? </span>
<span sid='23518' title='23518'>Vat about Milman and Van Shorst, and the Nicholson family, and old Mr Hyam, and little Billy James, and the others? </span>
<span sid='23519' title='23519'>Prove it! </span>
<span sid='23520' title='23520'>Is there a man or a voman in this valley vhat does not know it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23521' title='23521'>'See here!' said McMurdo earnestly. </span>
<span sid='23522' title='23522'>'I want you to take back what you've said or else make it good. </span>
<span sid='23523' title='23523'>One or the other you must do before I quit this room. </span>
<span sid='23524' title='23524'>Put yourself in my place. </span>
<span sid='23525' title='23525'>Here am I, a stranger in the town. </span>
<span sid='23526' title='23526'>I belong to a society that I know only as an innocent one. </span>
<span sid='23527' title='23527'>You'll find it through the length and breadth of the States, but always as an innocent one. </span>
<span sid='23528' title='23528'>Now, when I am counting upon joining it here, you tell me that it is the same as a murder society called the "Scowrers". </span>
<span sid='23529' title='23529'>I guess you owe me either an apology or else an explanation, Mr Shafter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23530' title='23530'>'I can but tell you vat the whole vorld knows, Mister. </span>
<span sid='23531' title='23531'>The bosses of the one are the bosses of the other. </span>
<span sid='23532' title='23532'>If you offend the one, it is the other vhat vill strike you. </span>
<span sid='23533' title='23533'>We have proved it too often.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23534' title='23534'>'That's just gossip - I want proof!' said McMurdo.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23535' title='23535'>'If you live here long you vill get your prod. </span>
<span sid='23536' title='23536'>But I forget that you are yourself one of them. </span>
<span sid='23537' title='23537'>You vill soon be as bad as the rest. </span>
<span sid='23538' title='23538'>But you vill find other lodgings, Mister. </span>
<span sid='23539' title='23539'>I cannot have you here. </span>
<span sid='23540' title='23540'>Is it not bad enough that one of these people come courting my Ettie, and that I dare not turn him down, but that I should have another for my boarder? </span>
<span sid='23541' title='23541'>Yes, indeed, you shall not sleep here after to-night!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23542' title='23542'>So McMurdo found himself under sentence of banishment both from his comfortable quarters and from the girl whom he loved. </span>
<span sid='23543' title='23543'>He found her alone in the sitting-room that same evening, and he poured his troubles into her ear.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23544' title='23544'>Sure, your father is after giving me notice,' he said. </span>
<span sid='23545' title='23545'>little I would care if it was just my room, but indeed, Ettie, though it's only a week that I've known you, you are the very breath of life to me, and I can't live without you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23546' title='23546'>'Oh, hush, Mr McMurdo! </span>
<span sid='23547' title='23547'>Don't speak so!' said the girl. </span>
<span sid='23548' title='23548'>'I have told you, have I not, that you are too late? </span>
<span sid='23549' title='23549'>There is another, and if I have not promised to marry him at once, at least I can promise no one else.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23550' title='23550'>'Suppose I had been first, Ettie, would I have had a chance?' </span>
<span sid='23551' title='23551'>The girl sank her face into her hands. </span>
<span sid='23552' title='23552'>'I wish to Heaven that you had been first,' she sobbed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23553' title='23553'>McMurdo was down on his knees before her in an instant. </span>
<span sid='23554' title='23554'>'For God's sake, Ettie, let it stand at that!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='23555' title='23555'>'Will you ruin your life and my own for the sake of this promise? </span>
<span sid='23556' title='23556'>Follow your heart, acushla! </span>
<span sid='23557' title='23557'>'Tis a safer guide than any promise given before you knew what it was that you were saying.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23558' title='23558'>He had seized Ettie's white hand between his own strong brown ones.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23559' title='23559'>'Say that you will be mine and we will face it out together!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23560' title='23560'>'Not here?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23561' title='23561'>'Yes, here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23562' title='23562'>'No, no Jack!' </span>
<span sid='23563' title='23563'>His arms were round her now. </span>
<span sid='23564' title='23564'>'It could not be here. </span>
<span sid='23565' title='23565'>Could you take me away?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23566' title='23566'>A struggle passed for a moment over McMurdo's face, but it ended by setting like granite. </span>
<span sid='23567' title='23567'>'No, here,' he said. </span>
<span sid='23568' title='23568'>'I'll hold you against the world, Ettie, right here where we are!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23569' title='23569'>'Why should we not leave together?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23570' title='23570'>'No, Ettie, I can't leave here.'</span>
<span sid='23571' title='23571'>'But why?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23572' title='23572'>'I'd never hold my head up again if I felt that I had been driven out. </span>
<span sid='23573' title='23573'>Besides, what is there to be afraid of? </span>
<span sid='23574' title='23574'>Are we not free folks in a free country? </span>
<span sid='23575' title='23575'>If you love me and I you, who will dare to come between?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23576' title='23576'>'You don't know, Jack. </span>
<span sid='23577' title='23577'>You've been here too short a time. </span>
<span sid='23578' title='23578'>You don't know this Baldwin. </span>
<span sid='23579' title='23579'>You don't know McGinty and his Scowrers.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23580' title='23580'>'No, I don't know them, and I don't fear them, and I don't believe in them!' said McMurdo. </span>
<span sid='23581' title='23581'>'I've lived among rough men, my darling, and instead of fearing them it has always ended that they have feared me - always, Ettie. </span>
<span sid='23582' title='23582'>It's mad on the face of it! </span>
<span sid='23583' title='23583'>If these men, as your father says, have done crime after crime in the valley, and if every one knows them by name, how comes it that none are brought to justice? </span>
<span sid='23584' title='23584'>You answer me that, Ettie!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23585' title='23585'>'Because no witness dares to appear against them. </span>
<span sid='23586' title='23586'>He would not live a month if he did. </span>
<span sid='23587' title='23587'>Also because they have always their own men to swear that the accused one was far from the scene of the crime. </span>
<span sid='23588' title='23588'>But surely, Jack, you must have read ah l this. </span>
<span sid='23589' title='23589'>I had understood that every paper in the United States was writing about it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23590' title='23590'>'Well, I have read something, it is true, but I had thought it was a story. </span>
<span sid='23591' title='23591'>Maybe these men have some reason in what they do. </span>
<span sid='23592' title='23592'>Maybe they are wronged and have no other way to help themselves.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23593' title='23593'>'Oh, Jack, don't let me hear you speak so! </span>
<span sid='23594' title='23594'>That is how he speaks - the other one!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23595' title='23595'>'Baldwin - he speaks like that, does he?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23596' title='23596'>'And that is why I loathe him so. </span>
<span sid='23597' title='23597'>Oh, Jack, now I can tell you the truth, I loathe him with ah my heart; but I fear him also. </span>
<span sid='23598' title='23598'>I fear him for myself, but, above all, I fear him for Father. </span>
<span sid='23599' title='23599'>I know that some great sorrow would come upon us if I dared to say what I really felt. </span>
<span sid='23600' title='23600'>That is why I have put him off with half-promises. </span>
<span sid='23601' title='23601'>It was in real truth our only hope. </span>
<span sid='23602' title='23602'>But if you would fly with me, Jack, we could take Father with us and live for ever far from the power of these wicked men.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23603' title='23603'>Again there was a struggle upon McMurdo's face, and again it set like granite. </span>
<span sid='23604' title='23604'>'No harm shall come to you, Ettie - nor to your father either. </span>
<span sid='23605' title='23605'>As to wicked men, I expect you may find that I am as bad as the worst of them before we're through.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23606' title='23606'>'No, no, Jack! </span>
<span sid='23607' title='23607'>I would trust you anywhere.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23608' title='23608'>McMurdo laughed bitterly. </span>
<span sid='23609' title='23609'>'Good Lord! how little you know of me! </span>
<span sid='23610' title='23610'>Your innocent soul, my darling, could not even guess what is passing in mine. </span>
<span sid='23611' title='23611'>But, hullo, who's the visitor?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23612' title='23612'>The door had opened suddenly and a young fellow came swaggering in with the air of one who is the master. </span>
<span sid='23613' title='23613'>He was a handsome, dashing young man of about the same age and build as McMurdo himself. </span>
<span sid='23614' title='23614'>Under his broad-brimmed block felt hat, which he had not troubled to remove, a handsome face, with fierce, domineering eyes and curved hawk-bill of a nose, looked savagely at the pair who sat by the stove.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23615' title='23615'>Ettie had jumped to her feet, full of confusion and alarm. </span>
<span sid='23616' title='23616'>'I'm glad to see you, Mr Baldwin,' said she. </span>
<span sid='23617' title='23617'>'You're earlier than I had thought. </span>
<span sid='23618' title='23618'>Come and sit down.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23619' title='23619'>Baldwin stood with his hands on his hips looking at McMurdo. </span>
<span sid='23620' title='23620'>'Who is this?' he asked curtly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23621' title='23621'>'It's a friend of mine, Mr Baldwin, a new boarder here. </span>
<span sid='23622' title='23622'>Mr McMurdo, may I introduce you to Mr Baldwin?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23623' title='23623'>The young men nodded in surly fashion to each other.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23624' title='23624'>'Maybe Miss Ettie has told you how it is with us?' said Baldwin.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23625' title='23625'>'I didn't understand that there was any relation between you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23626' title='23626'>'Didn't you? </span>
<span sid='23627' title='23627'>Well, you can understand it now. </span>
<span sid='23628' title='23628'>You can take it from me that this young lady is mine, and you'll find it a very fine evening for a walk.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23629' title='23629'>'Thank you, I am in no humour for a walk.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23630' title='23630'>'Aren't you?' </span>
<span sid='23631' title='23631'>The man's savage eyes were blazing with anger. </span>
<span sid='23632' title='23632'>'Maybe you are in a humour for a fight, Mr Boarder!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23633' title='23633'>'That I am!' cried McMurdo, springing to his feet. </span>
<span sid='23634' title='23634'>'You never said a more welcome word.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23635' title='23635'>'For God's sake, Jack! </span>
<span sid='23636' title='23636'>Oh, for God's sake!' cried poor, distracted Ettie. </span>
<span sid='23637' title='23637'>'Oh, Jack, Jack, he will hurt you!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23638' title='23638'>'Oh, it's "Jack", is it!' said Baldwin with an oath. </span>
<span sid='23639' title='23639'>'You've come to that already, have you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23640' title='23640'>'Oh, Ted, be reasonable - be kind! </span>
<span sid='23641' title='23641'>For my sake, Ted, if ever you loved me, be big-hearted and forgiving!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23642' title='23642'>'I think, Ettie, that if you were to leave us alone we could get this thing settled,' said McMurdo, quietly. </span>
<span sid='23643' title='23643'>'Or maybe, Mr Baldwin, you will take a turn down the street with me. </span>
<span sid='23644' title='23644'>It's a fine evening, and there's some open ground beyond the next block.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23645' title='23645'>'I'll get even with you without needing to dirty my hands,' said his enemy. </span>
<span sid='23646' title='23646'>'You'll wish you had never set foot in this house before I am through with you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23647' title='23647'>'No time like the present,' cried McMurdo.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23648' title='23648'>'I'll choose my own time, Mister. </span>
<span sid='23649' title='23649'>You can leave the time to me. </span>
<span sid='23650' title='23650'>See here!' </span>
<span sid='23651' title='23651'>He suddenly rolled up his sleeve and showed upon his forearm a peculiar sign which appeared to have been branded there. </span>
<span sid='23652' title='23652'>It was a circle with a triangle within it. </span>
<span sid='23653' title='23653'>'D'you know what that means?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23654' title='23654'>'I neither know nor core!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23655' title='23655'>'Well, you will know. </span>
<span sid='23656' title='23656'>I'll promise you that. </span>
<span sid='23657' title='23657'>You won't be much older, either. </span>
<span sid='23658' title='23658'>Perhaps Miss Ettie can tell you something about it. </span>
<span sid='23659' title='23659'>As to you, Ettie, you'll come back to me on your knees - D'ye hear, girl? - On your knees! - And then I'll tell you what your punishment may be. </span>
<span sid='23660' title='23660'>You've sowed - and by the Lord, I'll see that you reap!' </span>
<span sid='23661' title='23661'>He glared at them both in fury. </span>
<span sid='23662' title='23662'>Then he turned upon his heel, and an instant later the outer door had banged behind him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23663' title='23663'>For a few moments McMurdo and the girl stood in silence. </span>
<span sid='23664' title='23664'>Then she threw her arms around him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23665' title='23665'>'Oh, Jack, how brave you were! </span>
<span sid='23666' title='23666'>But it is no use - you must fly! </span>
<span sid='23667' title='23667'>To-night - Jack - to-night! </span>
<span sid='23668' title='23668'>It's your only hope. </span>
<span sid='23669' title='23669'>He will have your life. </span>
<span sid='23670' title='23670'>I read it in his horrible eyes. </span>
<span sid='23671' title='23671'>What chance have you against a dozen of them, with Boss McGinty and all the power of the Lodge behind them?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23672' title='23672'>McMurdo disengaged her hands, kissed her, and gently pushed her back into a chair. </span>
<span sid='23673' title='23673'>'There, acushla, there! </span>
<span sid='23674' title='23674'>Don't be disturbed or fear for me. </span>
<span sid='23675' title='23675'>I'm a Freeman myself. </span>
<span sid='23676' title='23676'>I'm after telling your father about it. </span>
<span sid='23677' title='23677'>Maybe I am no better than the others; so don't make a saint of me. </span>
<span sid='23678' title='23678'>Perhaps you hate me too, now that I've told you as much.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23679' title='23679'>'Hate you, Jack? </span>
<span sid='23680' title='23680'>While life lasts I could never do that! </span>
<span sid='23681' title='23681'>I've heard that there is no harm in being a Freeman anywhere but here; so why should I think the worse of you for that? </span>
<span sid='23682' title='23682'>But if you are a Freeman, Jack, why should you not go down and make a friend of Boss McGinty? </span>
<span sid='23683' title='23683'>Oh, hurry, Jack, hurry! </span>
<span sid='23684' title='23684'>Get your word in first, or the hounds will be on your trail.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23685' title='23685'>'I was thinking the same thing,' said McMurdo. </span>
<span sid='23686' title='23686'>'I'll go right now and fix it. </span>
<span sid='23687' title='23687'>You can tell your father that I'll sleep here to-night and find some other quarters in the morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23688' title='23688'>The bar of McGinty's saloon was crowded as usual, for it was the favourite loafing place of all the rougher elements of the town. </span>
<span sid='23689' title='23689'>The man was popular, for he had a rough, jovial disposition which formed a mask, covering a great deal which lay behind it. </span>
<span sid='23690' title='23690'>But apart from this popularity, the fear in which he was held throughout the township, and indeed down the whole thirty miles of the valley and past the mountains upon either side of it, was enough in itself to fill his bar, for none could afford to neglect his goodwill.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23691' title='23691'>Besides those secret powers which it was universally believed that he exercised in so pitiless a fashion, he was a high public official, a municipal councillor, and a commissioner for roads, elected to the office through the votes of the ruffians who in turn expected to receive favours at his hands. </span>
<span sid='23692' title='23692'>Assessments and taxes were enormous, the public works were notoriously neglected, the accounts were slurred over by bribed auditors, and the decent citizen was terrorized into paying public blackmail, and holding his tongue lest some worse thing befall him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23693' title='23693'>Thus it was that, year by year, Boss McGinty's diamond pins became more obtrusive, his gold chains more weighty across a more gorgeous vest, and his saloon stretched farther and farther, until it threatened to absorb one whole side of the Market Square.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23694' title='23694'>McMurdo pushed open the swinging door of the saloon and made his way amid the crowd of men within, through an atmosphere which was blurred with tobacco smoke and heavy with the smell of spirits. </span>
<span sid='23695' title='23695'>The place was brilliantly lighted, and the huge, heavily gilt min-ors upon every wall reflected and multiplied the garish illumination. </span>
<span sid='23696' title='23696'>There were several bar-tenders in their shirt-sleeves hard at work, mixing drinks for the loungers who fringed the broad, brass- trimmed counter.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23697' title='23697'>At the far end, with his body resting upon the bar, and a cigar stuck at an acute angle from the corner of his mouth, there stood a tall, strong, heavily built man, who could be none other than the famous McGinty himself. </span>
<span sid='23698' title='23698'>He was a black-maned giant, bearded to the cheek-bones, and with a shock of raven hair which fell to his collar. </span>
<span sid='23699' title='23699'>His complexion was as swarthy as that of an Italian, and his eyes were of a strange, dead black, which, combined with a slight squint, gave them a particularly sinister appearance.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23700' title='23700'>All else in the man - his noble proportions, his fine features, and his frank bearing	fitted in with that jovial man-to-man manner which he affected. </span>
<span sid='23701' title='23701'>Here, one would say, is a bluff, honest fellow, whose heart would be sound, however rude his outspoken words might seem. </span>
<span sid='23702' title='23702'>It was only when those dead, dark eyes, deep and remorseless, were turned upon a man that he shrank within himself, feeling that he was face to face with an infinite possibility of latent evil, with a strength and courage and cunning behind it which made it a thousand times more deadly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23703' title='23703'>Having had a good look at his man, McMurdo elbowed his way forward with his usual careless audacity, and pushed himself through the little group of courtiers who were fawning upon the powerful Boss, laughing uproariously at the smallest of his jokes. </span>
<span sid='23704' title='23704'>The young stranger's bold grey eyes looked back fearlessly through their glasses at the deadly black ones which turned sharply upon him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23705' title='23705'>'Well, young man. </span>
<span sid='23706' title='23706'>I can't call your face to mind.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23707' title='23707'>'I'm new here, Mr McGinty.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23708' title='23708'>'You are not so new that you can't give a gentleman his proper title.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23709' title='23709'>'He's Councillor McGinty, young man,' said a voice from the group.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23710' title='23710'>'I'm sorry, Councillor. </span>
<span sid='23711' title='23711'>I'm strange to the ways of the place. </span>
<span sid='23712' title='23712'>But I was advised to see you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23713' title='23713'>'Well, you see me. </span>
<span sid='23714' title='23714'>This is all there is. </span>
<span sid='23715' title='23715'>What d'you think of me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23716' title='23716'>'Well, it's early days. </span>
<span sid='23717' title='23717'>If your heart is as big as your body, and your soul as fine as your face, then I'd ask for nothing better,' said McMurdo.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23718' title='23718'>'By Gad you've got an Irish tongue in your head, anyhow,' cried the saloon-keeper, not quite certain whether to humour this audacious visitor or to stand upon his dignity. </span>
<span sid='23719' title='23719'>'So you are good enough to pass my appearance?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23720' title='23720'>'Sure,' said McMurdo.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23721' title='23721'>'And you were told to see me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23722' title='23722'>'I was.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23723' title='23723'>'And who told you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23724' title='23724'>'Brother Scanlan, of Lodge 341, Vermissa. </span>
<span sid='23725' title='23725'>I drink your health, Councillor, and to our better acquaintance.' </span>
<span sid='23726' title='23726'>He raised a glass with which he had been served to his lips and elevated his little finger as he drank it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23727' title='23727'>McGinty, who had been watching him narrowly, raised his thick black eyebrows.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23728' title='23728'>'Oh, it's like that, is it?' said he. </span>
<span sid='23729' title='23729'>'I'll have to look a bit closer into this, Mister-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23730' title='23730'>'McMurdo.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23731' title='23731'>'A bit closer, Mr McMurdo; for we don't take folk on trust in these parts, nor believe all we're told neither. </span>
<span sid='23732' title='23732'>Come in here for a moment, behind the bar.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23733' title='23733'>There was a small room there, lined round with barrels. </span>
<span sid='23734' title='23734'>McGinty carefully closed the door, and then seated himself on one of them, biting thoughtfully on his cigar, and surveying his companion with those disquieting eyes. </span>
<span sid='23735' title='23735'>For a couple of minutes he sat in complete silence. </span>
<span sid='23736' title='23736'>McMurdo bore the inspection cheerfully, one hand in his coat-pocket, the other twisting his brown moustache. </span>
<span sid='23737' title='23737'>Suddenly McGinty stooped and produced a wicked-looking revolver.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23738' title='23738'>'See here, my joker,' said he, 'if I thought you were playing any game on us, it would be a short shrift for you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23739' title='23739'>'This is a strange welcome,' McMurdo answered, with some dignity, 'for the bodymaster of a Lodge of Freemen to give to a stranger brother.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23740' title='23740'>'Aye, but it's just that same that you have to prove,' said McGinty, 'and God help you if you fail. </span>
<span sid='23741' title='23741'>Where were you made?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23742' title='23742'>'Lodge 29, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23743' title='23743'>'When?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23744' title='23744'>'June 24th, 1872.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23745' title='23745'>'What bodymaster?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23746' title='23746'>'James H. Scott.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23747' title='23747'>'Who is your district ruler?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23748' title='23748'>'Bartholomew Wilson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23749' title='23749'>'Hum! </span>
<span sid='23750' title='23750'>You seem glib enough in your tests. </span>
<span sid='23751' title='23751'>What are you doing here?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23752' title='23752'>'Working, the same as you - but a poorer job.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23753' title='23753'>'You have your back answer quick enough.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23754' title='23754'>'Yes, I was always quick of speech.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23755' title='23755'>'Are you quick of action?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23756' title='23756'>'I have had that name among those who knew me best.' </span>
<span sid='23757' title='23757'>'Well, we may try you sooner than you think. </span>
<span sid='23758' title='23758'>Have you heard anything of the Lodge in these parts?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23759' title='23759'>'I've heard that it takes a man to be a brother.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23760' title='23760'>'True for you, Mr McMurdo. </span>
<span sid='23761' title='23761'>Why did you leave <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>?' </span>
<span sid='23762' title='23762'>'I'm damned if I tell you that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23763' title='23763'>McGinty opened his eyes. </span>
<span sid='23764' title='23764'>He was not used to being answered in such fashion, and it amused him. </span>
<span sid='23765' title='23765'>'Why won't you tell me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23766' title='23766'>'Because no brother may tell another a lie.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23767' title='23767'>'Then the truth is too bad to tell?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23768' title='23768'>'You can put it that way if you like.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23769' title='23769'>'See here, Mister, you can't expect me, as Bodymaster, to pass into the Lodge a man for whose past he can't answer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23770' title='23770'>McMurdo looked puzzled. </span>
<span sid='23771' title='23771'>Then he took a worn newspaper-cutting from an inner pocket.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23772' title='23772'>'You wouldn't squeal on a fellow?' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23773' title='23773'>wipe my hand across your face if you say such words to me!' cried McGinty hotly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23774' title='23774'>'You are right, Councillor,' said McMurdo meekly. </span>
<span sid='23775' title='23775'>'I should apologize. </span>
<span sid='23776' title='23776'>I spoke without thought. </span>
<span sid='23777' title='23777'>Well, I know that I am safe in your hands. </span>
<span sid='23778' title='23778'>Look at that clipping.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23779' title='23779'>McGinty glanced his eyes over the account of the shooting of one Jonas Pinto, in the Lake Saloon, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Market Street&t=h'>Market Street</a>, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>, in the New Year week of 1874.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23780' title='23780'>'Your work?' he asked, as he handed back the paper. </span>
<span sid='23781' title='23781'>McMurdo nodded.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23782' title='23782'>'Why did you shoot him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23783' title='23783'>'I was helping Uncle Sam to make dollars. </span>
<span sid='23784' title='23784'>Maybe mine were not as good gold as his, but they looked as well and were cheaper to make. </span>
<span sid='23785' title='23785'>This man Pinto helped me to shove the queer-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23786' title='23786'>'To do what?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23787' title='23787'>'Well, it means to pass the dollars out into circulation. </span>
<span sid='23788' title='23788'>Then he said he would split. </span>
<span sid='23789' title='23789'>Maybe he did split. </span>
<span sid='23790' title='23790'>I didn't wait to see. </span>
<span sid='23791' title='23791'>I just killed him and lighted out for the coal country.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23792' title='23792'>'Why the coal country?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23793' title='23793'>'Cause I'd read in the papers that they weren't too particular in those parts.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23794' title='23794'>McGinty laughed. </span>
<span sid='23795' title='23795'>'You were first a coiner and then a murderer, and you came to these parts because you thought you'd be welcome?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23796' title='23796'>'That's about the size of it,' McMurdo answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23797' title='23797'>'Well, I guess you'll go far. </span>
<span sid='23798' title='23798'>Say, can you make those dollars yet?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23799' title='23799'>McMurdo took half a dozen from his pocket. </span>
<span sid='23800' title='23800'>'Those never passed the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Philadelphia&t=h'>Philadelphia</a> mint,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23801' title='23801'>'You don't say!' </span>
<span sid='23802' title='23802'>McGinty held them to the light in his enormous hand, which was as hairy as a gorilla's. </span>
<span sid='23803' title='23803'>'I can see no difference! </span>
<span sid='23804' title='23804'>Gar! you'll be a mighty useful brother, I'm thinking! </span>
<span sid='23805' title='23805'>We can do with a bad man or two among us, Friend McMurdo, for there are times when we have to take our own part. </span>
<span sid='23806' title='23806'>We'd soon be against the wall if we didn't shove back at those that were pushing us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23807' title='23807'>'Well, I guess I'll do my share of shoving with the rest of the boys.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23808' title='23808'>'You seem to have a good nerve. </span>
<span sid='23809' title='23809'>You didn't squirm when I put this pistol on you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23810' title='23810'>'It was not me that was in danger.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23811' title='23811'>'Who, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23812' title='23812'>'It was you, Councillor.' </span>
<span sid='23813' title='23813'>McMurdo drew a cocked pistol from the side-pocket of his pea-jacket. </span>
<span sid='23814' title='23814'>'I was covering you all the time. </span>
<span sid='23815' title='23815'>I guess my shot would have been as quick as yours.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23816' title='23816'>'By Gar!' </span>
<span sid='23817' title='23817'>McGinty flushed an angry red and then burst into a roar of laughter.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23818' title='23818'>'Say, we've had no such holy terror come to hand this many a year. </span>
<span sid='23819' title='23819'>I reckon the Lodge will learn to be proud of you. </span>
<span sid='23820' title='23820'>Well, what the hell do you want? </span>
<span sid='23821' title='23821'>And can't I speak alone with a gentleman for five minutes but you must butt in upon us?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23822' title='23822'>The bar-tender stood abashed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23823' title='23823'>'I'm sorry, Councillor, but it's Ted Baldwin. </span>
<span sid='23824' title='23824'>He says he must see you this very minute.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23825' title='23825'>The message was unnecessary, for the set, cruel face of the man himself was looking over the servant's shoulder. </span>
<span sid='23826' title='23826'>He pushed the bar-tender out and closed the door on him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23827' title='23827'>'So,' said he, with a furious glance at McMurdo, 'you got here first, did you? </span>
<span sid='23828' title='23828'>I've a word to say to you, Councillor, about this man.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23829' title='23829'>'Then say it here and now before my face,' cried McMurdo. </span>
<span sid='23830' title='23830'>say it at my own time, in my own way.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23831' title='23831'>'Tut, tut!' said McGinty getting off his barrel. </span>
<span sid='23832' title='23832'>'This will never do. </span>
<span sid='23833' title='23833'>We have a new brother here, Baldwin, and it's not for us to greet him in such a fashion. </span>
<span sid='23834' title='23834'>Hold out your hand, man, and make it up!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23835' title='23835'>'Never!' cried Baldwin in a fury.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23836' title='23836'>'I've offered to fight him if he thinks I have wronged him,' said McMurdo. </span>
<span sid='23837' title='23837'>'I'll fight him with fists, or, if that won't satisfy him, I'll fight him any other way he chooses. </span>
<span sid='23838' title='23838'>Now I'll leave it to you, Councillor, to judge between us as a Bodymaster should.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23839' title='23839'>'What is it, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23840' title='23840'>'A young lady. </span>
<span sid='23841' title='23841'>She's free to choose for herself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23842' title='23842'>'Is she?' cried Baldwin.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23843' title='23843'>'As between two brothers of the Lodge, I should say that she was,' said the Boss.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23844' title='23844'>'Oh, that's your ruling, is it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23845' title='23845'>'Yes, it is, Ted Baldwin,' said McGinty, with a wicked stare. </span>
<span sid='23846' title='23846'>'Is it you that would dispute it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23847' title='23847'>'You would throw over one that has stood by you this five years in favour of a man that you never saw before in your life? </span>
<span sid='23848' title='23848'>You're not Bodymaster for life, Jack McGinty, and, by God! when next it comes to a vote-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23849' title='23849'>The Councillor sprang at him like a tiger. </span>
<span sid='23850' title='23850'>His hand closed round the other's neck and he hurled him back across one of the barrels. </span>
<span sid='23851' title='23851'>In his mad fury he would have squeezed the life out of him if McMurdo had not interfered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23852' title='23852'>'Easy, Councillor! </span>
<span sid='23853' title='23853'>For Heaven's sake, go easy!' he cried, as he dragged him back.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23854' title='23854'>McGinty released his hold, and Baldwin, cowed and shaken, gasping for breath, and shivering in every limb as one who has looked over the very edge of death, sat up on the barrel over which he had been hurled.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23855' title='23855'>'You've been asking for it this many a day, Ted Baldwin - now you've got it!' cried McGinty, his huge chest rising and falling. </span>
<span sid='23856' title='23856'>'Maybe you think if I were voted down from Bodymaster you would find yourself in my shoes. </span>
<span sid='23857' title='23857'>It's for the Lodge to say that. </span>
<span sid='23858' title='23858'>But so long as I am the chief I'll have no man lift his voice against me or my rulings.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23859' title='23859'>'I have nothing against you,' mumbled Baldwin, feeling his throat.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23860' title='23860'>'Well, then,' cried the other, relapsing in a moment into a bluff joviality, 'we are all good friends again and there's an end of the matter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23861' title='23861'>He took a bottle of champagne down from the shelf and twisted out the cork.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23862' title='23862'>'See now,' he continued, as he filled three high glasses 'Let us drink the quarrelling toast of the Lodge. </span>
<span sid='23863' title='23863'>After that, as you know, there can be no bad blood between us. </span>
<span sid='23864' title='23864'>Now, then, the left hand on the apple of my throat, I say to you, Ted Baldwin, what is the offence, sir?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23865' title='23865'>'The clouds are heavy,' answered Baldwin.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23866' title='23866'>'But they will for ever brighten.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23867' title='23867'>'And this I swear!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23868' title='23868'>The men drank their wine, and the same ceremony was performed between Baldwin and McMurdo.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23869' title='23869'>'There,' cried McGinty, rubbing his hands, 'that's the end of the black blood. </span>
<span sid='23870' title='23870'>You come under Lodge discipline if it goes farther, and that's a heavy hand in these parts, as Brother Baldwin knows - and as you will damn soon find out, Brother McMurdo, if you ask for trouble.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23871' title='23871'>'Faith, I'd be slow to do that,' said McMurdo. </span>
<span sid='23872' title='23872'>He held out his hand to Baldwin. </span>
<span sid='23873' title='23873'>'I'm quick to quarrel and quick to forgive. </span>
<span sid='23874' title='23874'>It's my hot Irish blood, they tell me. </span>
<span sid='23875' title='23875'>But it's over for me, and I bear no grudge.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23876' title='23876'>Baldwin had to take the proffered hand; for the baleful eye of the terrible Boss was upon him. </span>
<span sid='23877' title='23877'>But his sullen face showed how little the words of the other had moved him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23878' title='23878'>McGinty clapped them both on the shoulders. </span>
<span sid='23879' title='23879'>'Tut! </span>
<span sid='23880' title='23880'>These girls, these girls!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='23881' title='23881'>'To think that the same petticoats should come between two of my boys. </span>
<span sid='23882' title='23882'>It's the devil's own luck. </span>
<span sid='23883' title='23883'>Well, it's the colleen inside of them that must settle the question, for it's outside the jurisdiction of a Bodymaster, and the Lord be praised for that. </span>
<span sid='23884' title='23884'>We have enough on us, without the women as well. </span>
<span sid='23885' title='23885'>You'll have to be affiliated to Lodge 341, Brother McMurdo. </span>
<span sid='23886' title='23886'>We have our own ways and methods, different from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>. </span>
<span sid='23887' title='23887'>Saturday night is our meeting, and if you come then we'll make you free for ever of the Vermissa Valley.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23888' title='23888'>CHAPTER 3 : Lodge 341, Vermissa</span>
<p>
<span sid='23889' title='23889'>On the day following the evening which had contained so many exciting events, McMurdo moved his lodgings from old Jacob Shafter's and took up his quarters at the Widow MacNamara's, on the extreme outskirts of the town. </span>
<span sid='23890' title='23890'>Scanlan, his original acquaintance aboard the train, had occasion shortly afterwards to move into Vermissa, and the two lodged together. </span>
<span sid='23891' title='23891'>There was no other boarder, and the hostess was an easy-going old Irish woman who left them to themselves, so that they had a freedom for speech and action welcome to men who had secrets in common.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23892' title='23892'>Shafter had relented to the extent of letting McMurdo come to his meals there when he liked, so that his intercourse with Ettie was by no means broken. </span>
<span sid='23893' title='23893'>On the contrary, it drew closer and more intimate as the weeks went by.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23894' title='23894'>In his bedroom at his new abode McMurdo felt it to be safe to take out the coining moulds, and under many a pledge of secrecy a number of the brothers from the Lodge were allowed to come in and see them, each of them carrying away in his pocket some examples of the false money, so cunningly struck that there was never the slightest difficulty or danger in passing it. </span>
<span sid='23895' title='23895'>Why, with such a wonderful art at his command, McMurdo should condescend to work at all was a perpetual mystery to his companions, though he made it clear to any one who asked him that if he lived without any visible means it would very quickly bring the police on his track.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23896' title='23896'>One policeman was, indeed, after him already; but the incident, as luck would have it, did the adventurer a great deal more good than harm. </span>
<span sid='23897' title='23897'>After the first introduction there were few evenings when he did not find his way to McGinty's saloon, there to make closer acquaintance with 'the boys', which was the jovial title by which the dangerous gang who infested the place were known to each other. </span>
<span sid='23898' title='23898'>His dashing manner and fearlessness of speech made him a favourite with them all, while the rapid and scientific way in which he polished off his antagonist in an 'all-in' bar-room scrap earned the respect of that rough community. </span>
<span sid='23899' title='23899'>Another incident, however, raised him even higher in their estimation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23900' title='23900'>Just at the crowded hour one night, the door opened and a man entered with the quiet blue uniform and peaked cap of the Coal and Iron Police. </span>
<span sid='23901' title='23901'>This was a special body raised by the railways and colliery owners to supplement the efforts of the ordinary civil police, who were perfectly helpless in the face of the organized ruffianism which terrorized the district. </span>
<span sid='23902' title='23902'>There was a hush as he entered, and many a curious glance was cast at him; but the relations between policemen and criminals are peculiar in the States, and McGinty himself, standing behind his counter, showed no surprise when the policeman enrolled himself among his customers.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23903' title='23903'>'A straight whiskey; for the night is bitter,' said the police-officer. </span>
<span sid='23904' title='23904'>'I don't think we have met before, Councillor?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23905' title='23905'>'You'll be the new captain?' said McGinty.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23906' title='23906'>'That's so. </span>
<span sid='23907' title='23907'>We're looking to you, Councillor, and to the other leading citizens, to help us in upholding law and order in this township. </span>
<span sid='23908' title='23908'>Captain Marvin is my name - of the Coal and Iron.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23909' title='23909'>'We'd do better without you, Captain Marvin,' said McGinty, coldly. </span>
<span sid='23910' title='23910'>'For we have our own police of the township, and no need for any imported goods. </span>
<span sid='23911' title='23911'>What are you but the paid tool of the capitalists, hired by them to club or to shoot your poorer fellow-citizen?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23912' title='23912'>'Well, well, we won't argue about that,' said the police- officer, good-humouredly. </span>
<span sid='23913' title='23913'>'I expect we all do our duty same as we see it, but we can't all see it the same.' </span>
<span sid='23914' title='23914'>He had drunk off his glass and had turned to go, when his eyes fell upon the face of Jack McMurdo, who was scowling at his elbow. </span>
<span sid='23915' title='23915'>'Hullo! </span>
<span sid='23916' title='23916'>Hullo!' he cried, looking him up and down. </span>
<span sid='23917' title='23917'>'Here's an old acquaintance!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23918' title='23918'>McMurdo shrank away from him. </span>
<span sid='23919' title='23919'>'I was never a friend to you nor any other cursed copper in my life,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23920' title='23920'>'An acquaintance isn't always a friend,' said the police- captain, grinning. </span>
<span sid='23921' title='23921'>'You're Jack McMurdo of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>, right enough, and don't you deny it!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23922' title='23922'>McMurdo shrugged his shoulders. </span>
<span sid='23923' title='23923'>'I'm not denying it,' said he. </span>
<span sid='23924' title='23924'>'D'ye think I'm ashamed of my own name?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23925' title='23925'>'You've got good cause to be, anyhow.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23926' title='23926'>'What the devil d'you mean by that?' he roared with his fists clenched.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23927' title='23927'>'No, no, Jack; bluster won't do with me. </span>
<span sid='23928' title='23928'>I was an officer in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a> before ever I came to this darned coal-bunker, and I know a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a> crook when I see one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23929' title='23929'>McMurdo's face fell. </span>
<span sid='23930' title='23930'>'Don't tell me that you're Marvin of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a> Central!' he cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23931' title='23931'>'Just the same old Teddy Marvin at your service. </span>
<span sid='23932' title='23932'>We haven't forgotten the shooting of Jonas Pinto up there.' </span>
<span sid='23933' title='23933'>'I never shot him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23934' title='23934'>'Did you not? </span>
<span sid='23935' title='23935'>That's good impartial evidence, ain't it? </span>
<span sid='23936' title='23936'>Well, his death came in uncommon handy for you, or they would have had you for shoving the queer. </span>
<span sid='23937' title='23937'>Well, we can let that be bygones, for, between you and me - and perhaps I'm going further than my duty in saying it - they could get no clear case against you, and <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>'s open to you tomorrow.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23938' title='23938'>'I'm very well where I am.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23939' title='23939'>'Well, I've given you the pointer, and you're a sulky dog not to thank me for it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23940' title='23940'>'Well, I suppose you mean well, and I do thank you,' said McMurdo in no very gracious manner.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23941' title='23941'>'It's mum with me so long as I see you living on the straight,' said the captain. </span>
<span sid='23942' title='23942'>'But, by the Lord! </span>
<span sid='23943' title='23943'>if you get off on the cross after this it's another story! </span>
<span sid='23944' title='23944'>So good night to you - and good night, Councillor.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23945' title='23945'>He left the bar-room; but not before he had created a local hero. </span>
<span sid='23946' title='23946'>McMurdo's deeds in far <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a> had been whispered before. </span>
<span sid='23947' title='23947'>He had put off all questions with a smile as one who did not wish to have greatness thrust upon him. </span>
<span sid='23948' title='23948'>But now the thing was officially confirmed. </span>
<span sid='23949' title='23949'>The bar-loafers crowded round him and shook him heartily by the hand. </span>
<span sid='23950' title='23950'>He was free of the community from that time on. </span>
<span sid='23951' title='23951'>He could drink hard and show little trace of it, but that evening, had his mate Scanlan not been at hand to lead him home, the feted hero would surely have spent his night under the bar.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23952' title='23952'>On a Saturday night McMurdo was introduced to the Lodge. </span>
<span sid='23953' title='23953'>He had thought to pass in without ceremony as being an initiate of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>; but there were particular rites in Vermissa of which they were proud, and these had to be undergone by every postulant. </span>
<span sid='23954' title='23954'>The assembly met in a large room reserved for such purposes at the Union House. </span>
<span sid='23955' title='23955'>Some sixty members assembled at Vermissa; but that by no means represented the full strength of the organization, for there were several other lodges in the valley, and others across the mountains on either side, who exchanged members when any serious business was afoot, so that a crime might be done by men who were strangers to the locality. </span>
<span sid='23956' title='23956'>Altogether, there were not less than five hundred scattered over the coal district.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23957' title='23957'>In the bare assembly room the men were gathered round a long table. </span>
<span sid='23958' title='23958'>At the side was a second one laden with bottles and glasses, on which some members of the company were already turning their eyes. </span>
<span sid='23959' title='23959'>McGinty sat at the head with a flat black velvet cap upon his shock of tangled black hair and a coloured purple stole round his neck, so that he seemed to be a priest presiding over some diabolical ritual. </span>
<span sid='23960' title='23960'>To right and left of him were the higher Lodge officials, the cruel, handsome face of Ted Baldwin among them. </span>
<span sid='23961' title='23961'>Each of these wore some scarf or medallion as emblem of his office.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23962' title='23962'>They were, for the most part, men of mature age; but the rest of the company consisted of young fellows from eighteen to twenty-five, the ready and capable agents who carried out the commands of their seniors. </span>
<span sid='23963' title='23963'>Among the older men were many whose features showed the tigerish, lawless souls within; but looking at the rank and file it was difficult to believe that these eager and open-faced young fellows were in very truth a dangerous gang of murderers, whose minds had suffered such complete moral perversion that they took a horrible pride in their proficiency at the business, and looked with the deepest respect at the man who had the reputation for making what they called a 'clean job'.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23964' title='23964'>To their contorted natures it had become a spirited and chivalrous thing to volunteer for service against some man who had never injured them, and whom, in many cases, they had never seen in their lives. </span>
<span sid='23965' title='23965'>The crime committed, they quarrelled as to who had actually struck the fatal blow, and amused each other and the company by describing the cries and contortions of the murdered man.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23966' title='23966'>At first they had shown some secrecy in their arrangements; but at the time which this narrative describes their proceedings were extraordinarily open, for the repeated failures of the law had proved to them that, on the one hand, no one would dare to witness against them, and, on the other, they had an unlimited number of staunch witnesses upon whom they could call, and a well-filled treasure chest from which they could draw the funds to engage the best legal talent in the State. </span>
<span sid='23967' title='23967'>In ten long years of outrage there had been no single conviction, and the only danger that ever threatened the Scowrers lay in the victim himself, who, however outnumbered and taken by surprise, might, and occasionally did, leave his mark upon his assailants.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23968' title='23968'>McMurdo had been warned that some ordeal lay before him, but no one would tell him in what it consisted. </span>
<span sid='23969' title='23969'>He was led now into an outer room by two solemn brothers. </span>
<span sid='23970' title='23970'>Through the plank partition he could hear the murmur of many voices from the assembly within. </span>
<span sid='23971' title='23971'>Once or twice he caught the sound of his own name, and he knew that they were discussing his candidature. </span>
<span sid='23972' title='23972'>Then there entered an inner guard with a green and gold sash across his chest.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23973' title='23973'>'The Bodymaster orders that he shall be trussed, blinded, and entered,' said he. </span>
<span sid='23974' title='23974'>The three of them then removed his coat, turned up the sleeve of his right arm, and finally passed a rope round above the elbows and made it fast. </span>
<span sid='23975' title='23975'>They next placed a thick black cap right over his head and the upper part of his face, so that he could see nothing. </span>
<span sid='23976' title='23976'>He was then led into the assembly hall.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23977' title='23977'>It was pitch-dark and very oppressive under his hood. </span>
<span sid='23978' title='23978'>He heard the rustle and murmur of the people round him, and then the voice of McGinty sounded, dull and distant, through the covering of his ears.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23979' title='23979'>'John McMurdo,' said the voice, 'are you already a member of the Ancient Order of Freemen?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23980' title='23980'>He bowed in assent.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23981' title='23981'>'Is your lodge No. 29, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23982' title='23982'>He bowed again.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23983' title='23983'>'Dark nights are unpleasant,' said the voice.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23984' title='23984'>'Yes, for strangers to travel,' he answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23985' title='23985'>'The clouds are heavy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23986' title='23986'>'Yes, a storm is approaching.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23987' title='23987'>'Are the brethren satisfied?' asked the Bodymaster. </span>
<span sid='23988' title='23988'>There was a general murmur of assent.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23989' title='23989'>'We know, brother, by your sign and by your counter sign, that you are indeed one of us,' said McGinty. </span>
<span sid='23990' title='23990'>'We would have you know, however, that in this county and in other counties of these parts we have certain rites, and also certain duties of our own, which call for good men. </span>
<span sid='23991' title='23991'>Are you ready to be tested?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23992' title='23992'>'I am.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23993' title='23993'>'Are you of stout heart?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23994' title='23994'>'I am.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23995' title='23995'>'Take a stride forward to prove it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='23996' title='23996'>As the words were said he felt two hard points in front of his eyes, pressing upon them so that it appeared as if he could not move forward without a danger of losing them. </span>
<span sid='23997' title='23997'>None the less, he nerved himself to step resolutely out, and as he did so the pressure melted away. </span>
<span sid='23998' title='23998'>There was a low murmur of applause.</span>
<p>
<span sid='23999' title='23999'>'He is of stout heart,' said the voice. </span>
<span sid='24000' title='24000'>'Can you bear pain?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24001' title='24001'>'As well as another,' he answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24002' title='24002'>'Test him!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24003' title='24003'>It was all he could do to keep himself from screaming out, for an agonizing pain shot through his forearm. </span>
<span sid='24004' title='24004'>He nearly fainted at the sudden shock of it; but he bit his lip and clenched his hands to hide his agony.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24005' title='24005'>'I can take more than that,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24006' title='24006'>This time there was loud applause. </span>
<span sid='24007' title='24007'>A finer first appearance had never been made in the Lodge. </span>
<span sid='24008' title='24008'>Hands clapped him on the back, and the hood was plucked from his head. </span>
<span sid='24009' title='24009'>He stood blinking and smiling amid the congratulations of the brothers.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24010' title='24010'>'One last word, Brother McMurdo,' said McGinty. </span>
<span sid='24011' title='24011'>'You have already sworn the oath of secrecy and fidelity, and you are aware that the punishment for any breach of it is instant and inevitable death?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24012' title='24012'>'I am,' said McMurdo.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24013' title='24013'>'And you accept the rule of the Bodymaster for the time being under all circumstances?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24014' title='24014'>'I do.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24015' title='24015'>'Then, in the name of Lodge 341, Vermissa, I welcome you to its privileges and debates. </span>
<span sid='24016' title='24016'>You will put the liquor on the table, Brother Scanlan, and we will drink to our worthy brother.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24017' title='24017'>McMurdo's coat had been brought to him; but before putting it on he examined his right arm, which still smarted heavily. </span>
<span sid='24018' title='24018'>There, on the flesh of the forearm, was a clear-cut circle with a triangle within it, deep and red, as the branding-iron had left it. </span>
<span sid='24019' title='24019'>One or two of his neighbours pulled up their sleeves and showed their own Lodge marks.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24020' title='24020'>'We've all had it,' said one, 'but not all as brave as you over it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24021' title='24021'>'Tut! </span>
<span sid='24022' title='24022'>It was nothing,' said he; but it burned and ached all the same.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24023' title='24023'>When the drinks which followed the ceremony of initiation had all been disposed of, the business of the Lodge proceeded. </span>
<span sid='24024' title='24024'>McMurdo, accustomed only to the prosaic performances of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>, listened with open ears, and more surprise than he ventured to show, to what followed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24025' title='24025'>'The first business on the agenda paper', said McGinty, 'is to read the following letter from Division Master Windle, of Merton County, Lodge 249. </span>
<span sid='24026' title='24026'>He says:</span>
<p>
<span sid='24027' title='24027'>Dear Sir, </span>
<span sid='24028' title='24028'>- There is a job to be done on Andrew Rae, of Rae and Sturmash, coal-owners near this place. </span>
<span sid='24029' title='24029'>You will remember that your Lodge owes us a return, having had the services of two brethren in the matter of the patrolman last fall. </span>
<span sid='24030' title='24030'>If you will send two good men they will be taken charge of by Treasurer Higgins of this Lodge, whose address you know. </span>
<span sid='24031' title='24031'>He will show them when to act and where. </span>
<span sid='24032' title='24032'>- Yours in freedom. </span>
<span sid='24033' title='24033'>J. W. Windle, DMAOF</span>
<p>
<span sid='24034' title='24034'>Windle has never refused us when we have had occasion to ask for the loan of a man or two, and it is not for us to refuse him.' </span>
<span sid='24035' title='24035'>McGinty paused and looked round the room with his dull, malevolent eyes. </span>
<span sid='24036' title='24036'>'Who will volunteer for the job?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24037' title='24037'>Several young fellows held up their hands. </span>
<span sid='24038' title='24038'>The Bodymaster looked at them with an approving smile.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24039' title='24039'>'You'll do, Tiger Cormac. </span>
<span sid='24040' title='24040'>If you handle it as well as you did the last, you won't be wrong. </span>
<span sid='24041' title='24041'>And you, Wilson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24042' title='24042'>'I've no pistol,' said the volunteer, a mere boy in his teens.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24043' title='24043'>'It's your first, is it not? </span>
<span sid='24044' title='24044'>Well, you have to be blooded some time. </span>
<span sid='24045' title='24045'>It will be a great start for you. </span>
<span sid='24046' title='24046'>As to the pistol, you'll find it waiting for you, or I'm mistaken. </span>
<span sid='24047' title='24047'>If you report yourselves on Monday it will be time enough. </span>
<span sid='24048' title='24048'>You'll get a great welcome when you return.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24049' title='24049'>'Any reward this time?' asked Cormac, a thick-set, dark- faced, brutal-looking young man, whose ferocity had earned him the nickname of 'Tiger'.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24050' title='24050'>'Never mind the reward. </span>
<span sid='24051' title='24051'>You just do it for the honour of the thing. </span>
<span sid='24052' title='24052'>Maybe when it is done there will be a few odd dollars at the bottom of the box.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24053' title='24053'>'What has the man done?' asked young Wilson.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24054' title='24054'>'Sure, it's not for the likes of you to ask what the man has done. </span>
<span sid='24055' title='24055'>He has been judged over there. </span>
<span sid='24056' title='24056'>That's no business of ours. </span>
<span sid='24057' title='24057'>All we have to do is to carry it out for them, same as they would for us. </span>
<span sid='24058' title='24058'>Speaking of that, two brothers from the Merton lodge are coming over to us next week to do some business in this quarter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24059' title='24059'>'Who are they?' asked someone.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24060' title='24060'>'Faith, it is wiser not to ask. </span>
<span sid='24061' title='24061'>If you know nothing you can testify nothing, and no trouble can come of it. </span>
<span sid='24062' title='24062'>But they are men who will make a clean job when they are about it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24063' title='24063'>'And time, too!' cried Ted Baldwin. </span>
<span sid='24064' title='24064'>'Folk are gettin' out of hand in these parts. </span>
<span sid='24065' title='24065'>It was only last week that three of our men were turned off by Foreman Blaker. </span>
<span sid='24066' title='24066'>It's been owing him a long time, and he'll get it full and proper.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24067' title='24067'>'Get what?' </span>
<span sid='24068' title='24068'>McMurdo whispered to his neighbour.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24069' title='24069'>'The business end of a buck-shot cartridge,' cried the man, with a loud laugh. </span>
<span sid='24070' title='24070'>'What think you of our ways, Brother?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24071' title='24071'>McMurdo's criminal soul seemed to have already absorbed the spirit of the vile association of which he was now a member. </span>
<span sid='24072' title='24072'>'I like it well,' said he. </span>
<span sid='24073' title='24073'>''Tis a proper place for a lad of mettle.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24074' title='24074'>Several of those who sat around heard his words and applauded them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24075' title='24075'>'What's that?' cried the black-maned Bodymaster, from the end of the table.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24076' title='24076'>' 'Tis our new brother, sir, who finds our ways to his taste.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24077' title='24077'>McMurdo rose to his feet for an instant. </span>
<span sid='24078' title='24078'>'I would say, Eminent Bodymaster, that if a man should be wanted I should take it as an honour to be chosen to help the Lodge.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24079' title='24079'>There was great applause at this. </span>
<span sid='24080' title='24080'>It was felt that a new sun was pushing its rim above the horizon. </span>
<span sid='24081' title='24081'>To some of the elders it seemed that the progress was a little too rapid.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24082' title='24082'>'I would move,' said the secretary, Harraway, a vulture-faced old greybeard who sat near the chairman, 'that Brother McMurdo should wait until it is the good pleasure of the Lodge to employ him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24083' title='24083'>'Sure, that was what I meant; I'm in your hands,' said McMurdo.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24084' title='24084'>'Your time will come, Brother,' said the chairman. </span>
<span sid='24085' title='24085'>'We have marked you down as a willing man, and we believe that you will do good work in these parts. </span>
<span sid='24086' title='24086'>There is a small matter to-night in which you may take a hand, if it so please you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24087' title='24087'>'I will wait for something that is worth while.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24088' title='24088'>'You can come to-night, anyhow, and it will help you to know what we stand for in this community. </span>
<span sid='24089' title='24089'>I will make the announcement later. </span>
<span sid='24090' title='24090'>Meanwhile' - he glanced at his agenda paper - I have one or two more points to bring before the meeting. </span>
<span sid='24091' title='24091'>First of all, I will ask the treasurer as to our bank balance. </span>
<span sid='24092' title='24092'>There is the pension to Jim Carnaway's widow. </span>
<span sid='24093' title='24093'>He was struck down doing the work of the Lodge, and it is for us to see that she is not the loser.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24094' title='24094'>Jim was shot last month when they tried to kill Chester Wilcox, of Marley Creek,' McMurdo's neighbour informed him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24095' title='24095'>'The funds are good at the moment,' said the treasurer, with the bank-book in front of him. </span>
<span sid='24096' title='24096'>'The firms have been generous of late. </span>
<span sid='24097' title='24097'>Max Linder and Co. paid five hundred to be left alone. </span>
<span sid='24098' title='24098'>Walker Brothers sent in a hundred, but I took it on myself to return it and ask for five. </span>
<span sid='24099' title='24099'>If I do not hear by Wednesday their winding gear may get out of order. </span>
<span sid='24100' title='24100'>We had to burn their breaker last year before they became reasonable. </span>
<span sid='24101' title='24101'>Then <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the West&t=h'>the West</a> Section Coaling Company has paid its annual contribution. </span>
<span sid='24102' title='24102'>We have enough in hand to meet any obligations.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24103' title='24103'>'What about Archie <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Swindon&t=h'>Swindon</a>?' asked a brother.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24104' title='24104'>'He has sold out and left the district. </span>
<span sid='24105' title='24105'>The old devil left a note for us to say that he had rather be a free crossing- sweeper in New <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=York&t=h'>York</a> than a large mine-owner under the power of a ring of blackmailers. </span>
<span sid='24106' title='24106'>By Gar! it was as well that he made a break for it before the note reached us! </span>
<span sid='24107' title='24107'>I guess he won't show his face in this valley again.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24108' title='24108'>An elderly, clean-shaven man with a kindly face and a good brow rose from the end of the table which faced the chairman. </span>
<span sid='24109' title='24109'>'Mr Treasurer,' he asked, 'may I ask who has bought the property of this man that we have driven out of the district?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24110' title='24110'>'Yes, Brother Morris. </span>
<span sid='24111' title='24111'>It has been bought by the State and Merton County Railroad Company.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24112' title='24112'>'And who bought the mines of Todman and of Lee that came into the market in the same way last year?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24113' title='24113'>'The same company, Brother Morris.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24114' title='24114'>'And who bought the ironworks of Manson and of Shuman and of Van Deher and of Atwood, which have all been given up of late?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24115' title='24115'>'They were all bought by <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the West&t=h'>the West</a> Gilmerton General Mining Company.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24116' title='24116'>'I don't see, Brother Morris,' said the chairman, 'that it matters a nickel to us who buys them, since they can't carry them out of the district.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24117' title='24117'>'With all respect to you, Eminent Bodymaster, I think that it may matter very much to us. </span>
<span sid='24118' title='24118'>This process has been going on now for ten long years. </span>
<span sid='24119' title='24119'>We are gradually driving all the small men out of trade. </span>
<span sid='24120' title='24120'>What is the result? </span>
<span sid='24121' title='24121'>We find in their places great companies like the Railroad or the General Iron, who have their directors in New <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=York&t=h'>York</a> or <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Philadelphia&t=h'>Philadelphia</a>, and care nothing for our threats. </span>
<span sid='24122' title='24122'>We can take it out of their local bosses, but it only means that others will be sent in their stead. </span>
<span sid='24123' title='24123'>And we are making it dangerous for ourselves. </span>
<span sid='24124' title='24124'>The small men could not harm us. </span>
<span sid='24125' title='24125'>They had not the money nor the power. </span>
<span sid='24126' title='24126'>So long as we did not squeeze them too dry, they would stay on under our power. </span>
<span sid='24127' title='24127'>But if these big companies find that we stand between them and their profits, they will spare no pains and no expense to hunt us down and bring us to court.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24128' title='24128'>There was a hush at these ominous words, and every face darkened as gloomy looks were exchanged. </span>
<span sid='24129' title='24129'>So omnipotent and unchallenged had they been that the very thought that there was possible retribution in the background had been banished from their minds. </span>
<span sid='24130' title='24130'>And yet the idea struck a chill to the most reckless of them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24131' title='24131'>'It is my advice', the speaker continued, 'that we go easier upon the small men. </span>
<span sid='24132' title='24132'>On the day that they have all been driven out the power of this society will have been broken.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24133' title='24133'>Unwelcome truths are not popular. </span>
<span sid='24134' title='24134'>There were angry cries as the speaker resumed his seat. </span>
<span sid='24135' title='24135'>McGinty rose with gloom upon his brow.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24136' title='24136'>'Brother Morris,' said he, 'you were always a croaker. </span>
<span sid='24137' title='24137'>So long as the members of this Lodge stand together there is no power in the United States that can touch them. </span>
<span sid='24138' title='24138'>Sure, have we not tried it often enough in the law courts? </span>
<span sid='24139' title='24139'>I expect the big companies will find it easier to pay than to fight, same as the little companies do. </span>
<span sid='24140' title='24140'>And now, brethren' -  McGinty took off his black velvet cap and his stole as he spoke - 'this Lodge has finished its business for the evening save for one small matter which may be mentioned when we are parting. </span>
<span sid='24141' title='24141'>The time has now come for fraternal refreshment and for harmony.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24142' title='24142'>Strange indeed is human nature. </span>
<span sid='24143' title='24143'>Here were these men to whom murder was familiar, who again and again had struck down the father of the family, some man against whom they had no personal feeling, without one thought of compunction or of compassion for his weeping wife or helpless children, and yet the tender or pathetic in music could move them to tears. </span>
<span sid='24144' title='24144'>McMurdo had a fine tenor voice, and if he had failed to gain the goodwill of the Lodge before, it could no longer have been withheld after he had thrilled them with 'I'm Sitting on the Stile, Mary', and 'On the Banks of Allan Water'. </span>
<span sid='24145' title='24145'>In his very first night the new recruit had made himself one of the most popular of the brethren, marked already for advancement and high office. </span>
<span sid='24146' title='24146'>There were other qualities, however, besides those of good fellowship, to make a worthy Freeman, and of these he was given an example before the evening was over. </span>
<span sid='24147' title='24147'>The whiskey bottle had passed round many times, and the men were flushed and ripe for mischief, when their Bodymaster rose once more to address them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24148' title='24148'>'Boys,' said he, 'there's one man in this town that wants trimming up, and it's for you to see that he gets it. </span>
<span sid='24149' title='24149'>I'm speaking of James Stanger, of the Herald. </span>
<span sid='24150' title='24150'>You've seen how he's been opening his mouth against us again?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24151' title='24151'>There was a murmur of assent, with many a muttered oath. </span>
<span sid='24152' title='24152'>McGinty took a slip of paper from his waistcoat pocket.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24153' title='24153'>'"Law and Order!" </span>
<span sid='24154' title='24154'>That's how he heads it. </span>
<span sid='24155' title='24155'>"Reign of Terror in the Coal and Iron District. </span>
<span sid='24156' title='24156'>Twelve years have now elapsed since the first assassinations which proved the existence of a criminal organization in our midst. </span>
<span sid='24157' title='24157'>From that day these outrages have never ceased, until now they have reached a pitch which makes us the opprobrium of the civilized world. </span>
<span sid='24158' title='24158'>Is it for such results as this that our great country welcomes to its bosom the alien who flies from the despotisms of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>? </span>
<span sid='24159' title='24159'>Is it that they shall themselves become tyrants over the very men who have given them shelter, and that a state of terrorism and lawlessness should be established under the very shadow of the sacred folds of the starry flag of freedom which would raise horror in our minds if we read of it as existing under the most effete monarchy of the East? </span>
<span sid='24160' title='24160'>The men are known. </span>
<span sid='24161' title='24161'>The organization is patent and public. </span>
<span sid='24162' title='24162'>How long are we to endure it? </span>
<span sid='24163' title='24163'>Can we for ever live - "Sure, I've read enough of the slush!' cried the chairman, tossing the paper down upon the table. </span>
<span sid='24164' title='24164'>'That's what he says of us. </span>
<span sid='24165' title='24165'>The question I'm asking you is, What shall we say to him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24166' title='24166'>'Kill him!' cried a dozen fierce voices.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24167' title='24167'>'I protest against that,' said Brother Morris, the man of the good brow and shaven face. </span>
<span sid='24168' title='24168'>'I tell you, brethren, that our hand is too heavy in this valley, and that there will come a point where, in self-defence, every man will unite to crush us out. </span>
<span sid='24169' title='24169'>James Stanger is an old man. </span>
<span sid='24170' title='24170'>He is respected in the township and the district. </span>
<span sid='24171' title='24171'>His paper stands for all that is solid in the valley. </span>
<span sid='24172' title='24172'>If that man is struck down, there will be a stir through this State that will only end with our destruction.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24173' title='24173'>'And how would they bring about our destruction, Mister Stand-back?' cried McGinty. </span>
<span sid='24174' title='24174'>'Is it by the police? </span>
<span sid='24175' title='24175'>Sure, half of them are in our pay and half of them afraid of us. </span>
<span sid='24176' title='24176'>Or is it by the law courts and the judge? </span>
<span sid='24177' title='24177'>Haven't we tried that before now, and what ever came of it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24178' title='24178'>'There is a Judge Lynch that might try the case,' said Brother Morris.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24179' title='24179'>A general shout of anger greeted the suggestion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24180' title='24180'>'I have but to raise my finger,' cried McGinty, 'and I could put two hundred men into this town that would clear it out from end to end.' </span>
<span sid='24181' title='24181'>Then, suddenly raising his voice and bending his huge black brows into a terrible frown, 'See here, Brother Morris, I have my eye on you, and have had for some time! </span>
<span sid='24182' title='24182'>You've no heart yourself, and you try to take the heart out of others. </span>
<span sid='24183' title='24183'>It will be an ill day for you, Brother Morris, when your own name comes on our agenda paper, and I'm thinking that it's just there that I ought to place it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24184' title='24184'>Morris had turned deadly pale, and his knees seemed to give way under him as he fell back into his chair. </span>
<span sid='24185' title='24185'>He raised his glass in his trembling hand and drank before he could answer. </span>
<span sid='24186' title='24186'>'I apologize, Eminent Bodymaster, to you and to every brother in this Lodge if I have said more than I should. </span>
<span sid='24187' title='24187'>I am a faithful member - you all know that - and it is my fear lest evil come to the Lodge which makes me speak in anxious words. </span>
<span sid='24188' title='24188'>But I have greater trust in your judgment than in my own, Eminent Bodymaster, and I promise you that I will not offend again.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24189' title='24189'>The Bodymaster's scowl relaxed as he listened to the humble words. </span>
<span sid='24190' title='24190'>'Very good, Brother Morris. </span>
<span sid='24191' title='24191'>It's myself that would be sorry if it were needful to give you a lesson. </span>
<span sid='24192' title='24192'>But so long as I am in this chair we shall be a united Lodge in word and in deed. </span>
<span sid='24193' title='24193'>And now, boys,' he continued, looking round at the company, 'I'll say this much, that if Stanger got his full deserts there would be more trouble than we need ask for. </span>
<span sid='24194' title='24194'>These editors hang together, and every journal in the state would be crying out for police and troops. </span>
<span sid='24195' title='24195'>But I guess you can give him a pretty severe warning. </span>
<span sid='24196' title='24196'>Will you fix it, Brother Baldwin?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24197' title='24197'>'Sure!' said the young man, eagerly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24198' title='24198'>'How many will you take?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24199' title='24199'>'Half-a-dozen, and two to guard to door. </span>
<span sid='24200' title='24200'>You'll come, Gower, and you, Manse!, and you, Scanlan, and the two Willabys.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24201' title='24201'>'I promised the new brother he should go,' said the chairman.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24202' title='24202'>Ted Baldwin looked at McMurdo with eyes which showed that he had not forgotten nor forgiven. </span>
<span sid='24203' title='24203'>'Well, he can come if he wants,' he said, in a surly voice. </span>
<span sid='24204' title='24204'>'That's enough. </span>
<span sid='24205' title='24205'>The sooner we get to work the better.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24206' title='24206'>The company broke up with shouts and yells and snatches of drunken song. </span>
<span sid='24207' title='24207'>The bar was still crowded with revellers, and many of the brethren remained there. </span>
<span sid='24208' title='24208'>The little band who had been told off for duty passed out into the street, proceeding in twos and threes along the side-walk so as not to provoke attention. </span>
<span sid='24209' title='24209'>It was a bitterly cold night, with a half-moon shining brilliantly in a frosty, star-spangled sky. </span>
<span sid='24210' title='24210'>The men stopped and gathered in a yard which faced a high building. </span>
<span sid='24211' title='24211'>The words 'Vermissa Herald' were printed in gold lettering between the brightly-lit windows. </span>
<span sid='24212' title='24212'>From within came the clanking of the printing-press.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24213' title='24213'>'Here, you,' said Baldwin to McMurdo; 'you can stand below at the door and see that the road is kept open for us. </span>
<span sid='24214' title='24214'>Arthur Willaby can stay with you. </span>
<span sid='24215' title='24215'>You others come with me. </span>
<span sid='24216' title='24216'>Have no fear, boys, for we have a dozen witnesses that we are in the Union Bar at this very moment.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24217' title='24217'>It was nearly midnight, and the street was deserted save for one or two revellers upon their way home. </span>
<span sid='24218' title='24218'>The party crossed the road and, pushing open the door of the newspaper office, Baldwin and his men rushed in and up the stair which faced them. </span>
<span sid='24219' title='24219'>McMurdo and another remained below. </span>
<span sid='24220' title='24220'>From the room above came a shout, a cry for help, and then the sound of trampling feet and of falling chairs. </span>
<span sid='24221' title='24221'>An instant later a grey-haired man rushed out on to the landing.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24222' title='24222'>He was seized before he could get farther, and his spectacles came tinkling down to McMurdo's feet. </span>
<span sid='24223' title='24223'>There was a thud and a groan. </span>
<span sid='24224' title='24224'>He was on his face and half-a-dozen sticks were clattering together as they fell upon him. </span>
<span sid='24225' title='24225'>He writhed, and his long, thin limbs quivered under the blows. </span>
<span sid='24226' title='24226'>The others ceased at last; but Baldwin, his cruel face set in an infernal smile, was hacking at the man's head, which he vainly endeavoured to defend with his arms. </span>
<span sid='24227' title='24227'>His white hair was dabbled with patches of blood. </span>
<span sid='24228' title='24228'>Baldwin was still stooping over his victim, putting in a short, vicious blow whenever he could see a part exposed, when McMurdo dashed up the stair and pushed him back.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24229' title='24229'>'You'll kill the man,' said he. </span>
<span sid='24230' title='24230'>'Drop it!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24231' title='24231'>Baldwin looked at him in amazement. </span>
<span sid='24232' title='24232'>'Curse you!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='24233' title='24233'>'Who are you to interfere - you that are new to the Lodge? </span>
<span sid='24234' title='24234'>Stand back!' </span>
<span sid='24235' title='24235'>He raised his stick; but McMurdo had whipped his pistol out of his hip pocket.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24236' title='24236'>'Stand back yourself!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='24237' title='24237'>'I'll blow your face in if you lay a hand on me. </span>
<span sid='24238' title='24238'>As to the Lodge, wasn't it the order of the Bodymaster that the man was not to be killed - and what are you doing but killing him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24239' title='24239'>'It's truth he says,' remarked one of the men.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24240' title='24240'>'By Gar! you'd best hurry yourselves!' cried the man below. </span>
<span sid='24241' title='24241'>'The windows are all lighting up and you'll have the whole town here inside of five minutes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24242' title='24242'>There was indeed the sound of shouting in the street, and a little group of compositors and typesetters was forming in the hall below and nerving itself to action. </span>
<span sid='24243' title='24243'>Leaving the limp and motionless body of the editor at the head of the stair, the criminals rushed down and made their way swiftly along the street. </span>
<span sid='24244' title='24244'>Having reached the Union House, some of them mixed with the crowd in McGinty's saloon, whispering across the bar to the Boss that the job had been well carried through. </span>
<span sid='24245' title='24245'>Others, and among them McMurdo, broke away into side-streets, and so by devious paths to their own homes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24246' title='24246'>CHAPTER 4 : The Valley of Fear</span>
<p>
<span sid='24247' title='24247'>When McMurdo awoke next morning he had good reason to remember his initiation into the Lodge. </span>
<span sid='24248' title='24248'>His head ached with the effect of the drink, and his arm, where he had been branded, was hot and swollen. </span>
<span sid='24249' title='24249'>Having his own peculiar source of income, he was irregular in his attendance at his work; so he had a late breakfast and remained at home for the morning, writing a long letter to a friend. </span>
<span sid='24250' title='24250'>Afterwards he read the Daily Herald. </span>
<span sid='24251' title='24251'>In a special column, put in at the last moment, he read, 'OUTRAGE AT THE HERALD OFFICE. </span>
<span sid='24252' title='24252'>EDITOR SERIOUSLY INJURED.' </span>
<span sid='24253' title='24253'>It was a short account of the facts with which he was himself more familiar than the writer could have been. </span>
<span sid='24254' title='24254'>It ended with the statement:</span>
<p>
<span sid='24255' title='24255'>The matter is now in the hands of the police, but it can hardly be hoped that their exertions will be attended by any better results than in the past. </span>
<span sid='24256' title='24256'>Some of the men were recognized, and there is hope that a conviction may be obtained. </span>
<span sid='24257' title='24257'>The source of the outrage was, it need hardly be said, that infamous society which has held this community in bondage for so long a period, and against which the Herald has taken so uncompromising a stand. </span>
<span sid='24258' title='24258'>Mr Stanger's many friends will rejoice to hear that, though he has been cruelly and brutally beaten, and has sustained severe injuries about the head, there is no immediate danger to his life.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24259' title='24259'>Below, it stated that a guard of Coal and Iron Police, armed with <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Winchester&t=h'>Winchester</a> rifles, had been requisitioned for the defence of the office.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24260' title='24260'>McMurdo had laid down the paper, and was lighting his pipe with a hand which was shaky from the excesses of the previous evening, when there was a knock outside, and his landlady brought to him a note which had just been handed in by a lad. </span>
<span sid='24261' title='24261'>It was unsigned, and ran thus:</span>
<p>
<span sid='24262' title='24262'>I should wish to speak to you, but had rather not do so in your house. </span>
<span sid='24263' title='24263'>You will find me beside the flagstaff upon Miller Hill. </span>
<span sid='24264' title='24264'>If you will come there now I have something which it is important for you to hear and for me to say.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24265' title='24265'>McMurdo read the note twice with the utmost surprise; for he could not imagine what it meant or who was the author of it. </span>
<span sid='24266' title='24266'>Had it been in a feminine hand he might have imagined that it was the beginning of one of those adventures which had been familiar enough in his past life. </span>
<span sid='24267' title='24267'>But it was the writing of a man, and of a well-educated one, too. </span>
<span sid='24268' title='24268'>Finally, after some hesitation, he determined to see the matter through.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24269' title='24269'>Miller Hill is an ill-kept public park in the very centre of the town. </span>
<span sid='24270' title='24270'>In summer it is a favourite resort of the people, but in winter it is desolate enough. </span>
<span sid='24271' title='24271'>From the top of it one has a view not only of the whole grimy, straggling town, but of the winding valley beneath, with its scattered mines and factories blackening the snow on either side of it, and of the wooded and white-capped ranges flanking it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24272' title='24272'>McMurdo strolled up the winding path hedged in with evergreens until he reached the deserted restaurant which forms the centre of summer gaiety. </span>
<span sid='24273' title='24273'>Beside it was a bare flagstaff, and underneath it a man, his hat drawn down and the collar of his overcoat raised up. </span>
<span sid='24274' title='24274'>When he turned his face McMurdo saw that it was Brother Morris, he who had incurred the anger of the Bodymaster the night before. </span>
<span sid='24275' title='24275'>The Lodge sign was given and exchanged as they met.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24276' title='24276'>'I wanted to have a word with you, Mr McMurdo,' said the older man, speaking with a hesitation which showed that he was on delicate ground. </span>
<span sid='24277' title='24277'>'It was kind of you to come.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24278' title='24278'>'Why did you not put your name to the note?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24279' title='24279'>'One has to be cautious, Mister. </span>
<span sid='24280' title='24280'>One never knows in times like these how a thing may come back to one. </span>
<span sid='24281' title='24281'>One never knows either who to trust or who not to trust.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24282' title='24282'>'Surely one may trust brothers of the Lodge?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24283' title='24283'>'No, no; not always,' cried Morris with vehemence. </span>
<span sid='24284' title='24284'>'Whatever we say, even what we think, seems to go back to that man McGinty.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24285' title='24285'>'Look here,' said McMurdo sternly; 'it was only last night, as you know well, that I swore good faith to our Bodymaster. </span>
<span sid='24286' title='24286'>Would you be asking me to break my oath?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24287' title='24287'>'If that is the view you take,' said Morris, sadly, 'I can only say that I am sorry I gave you the trouble to come and meet me. </span>
<span sid='24288' title='24288'>Things have come to a bad pass when two free citizens cannot speak their thoughts to each other.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24289' title='24289'>McMurdo, who had been watching his companion very narrowly, relaxed somewhat in his bearing. </span>
<span sid='24290' title='24290'>'Sure, I spoke for myself only,' said he. </span>
<span sid='24291' title='24291'>'I am a new-comer, as you know, and I am strange to it all. </span>
<span sid='24292' title='24292'>It is not for me to open my mouth, Mr Morris, and if you think well to say anything to me I am here to hear it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24293' title='24293'>And to take it back to Boss McGinty,' said Morris bitterly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24294' title='24294'>'Indeed, then, you do me injustice there,' cried McMurdo. </span>
<span sid='24295' title='24295'>'For myself I am loyal to the Lodge, and so I tell you straight; but I would be a poor creature if I were to repeat to any other what you might say to me in confidence. </span>
<span sid='24296' title='24296'>It will go no further than me; though I warn you that you may get neither help nor sympathy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24297' title='24297'>'I have given up looking for either the one or the other,' said Morris. </span>
<span sid='24298' title='24298'>'I may be putting my very life in your hands by what I say, but, bad as you are - and it seemed to me last night that you were shaping to be as bad as the worst - still you are new to it, and your conscience cannot yet be as hardened as theirs. </span>
<span sid='24299' title='24299'>That was why I thought to speak with you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24300' title='24300'>'Well, what have you to say?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24301' title='24301'>'If you give me away, may a curse be on your 'Sure, I said I would not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24302' title='24302'>'I would ask you, then, when you joined the Freemen's Society in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>, and swore vows of charity and fidelity, did ever it cross your mind that you might find it would lead you to crime?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24303' title='24303'>'If you call it crime,' McMurdo answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24304' title='24304'>'Call it crime!' cried Morris, his voice vibrating with passion. </span>
<span sid='24305' title='24305'>'You have seen little of it if you can call it anything else. </span>
<span sid='24306' title='24306'>Was it crime last night when a man old enough to be your father was beaten till the blood dripped from his white hairs? </span>
<span sid='24307' title='24307'>Was that crime - or what else would you call it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24308' title='24308'>'There are some would say it was war,' said McMurdo. </span>
<span sid='24309' title='24309'>'A war of two classes with all in, so that each struck as best it could.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24310' title='24310'>'Well, did you think of such a thing when you joined the Freemen's Society in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24311' title='24311'>'No, I'm bound to say I did not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24312' title='24312'>'Nor did I when I joined it at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Philadelphia&t=h'>Philadelphia</a>. </span>
<span sid='24313' title='24313'>It was just a benefit club and a meeting-place for one's fellows. </span>
<span sid='24314' title='24314'>Then I heard of this place - curse the hour that the name first fell upon my ears! - and I came to better myself. </span>
<span sid='24315' title='24315'>My God! to better myself! </span>
<span sid='24316' title='24316'>My wife and three children came with me. </span>
<span sid='24317' title='24317'>I started a dry-goods store in Market Square, and I prospered well. </span>
<span sid='24318' title='24318'>The word had gone round that I was a Freeman, and I was forced to join the local lodge, same as you did last night. </span>
<span sid='24319' title='24319'>I've the badge of shame on my forearm, and something worse branded on my heart. </span>
<span sid='24320' title='24320'>I found that I was under the orders of a black villain, and caught in a meshwork of crime. </span>
<span sid='24321' title='24321'>What could I do? </span>
<span sid='24322' title='24322'>Every word I said to make things better was taken as treason, same as it was last night. </span>
<span sid='24323' title='24323'>I can't get away, for all I have in the world is in my store. </span>
<span sid='24324' title='24324'>If I leave the society, I know well that it means murder to me, and God knows what to my wife and children. </span>
<span sid='24325' title='24325'>Oh, man, it is awful - awful!' </span>
<span sid='24326' title='24326'>He put his hands to his face, and his body shook with convulsive sobs.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24327' title='24327'>McMurdo shrugged his shoulders. </span>
<span sid='24328' title='24328'>'You were too soft for the job,' said he. </span>
<span sid='24329' title='24329'>'You are the wrong sort for such work.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24330' title='24330'>'I had a conscience and a religion, but they made me a criminal among them. </span>
<span sid='24331' title='24331'>I was chosen for a job. </span>
<span sid='24332' title='24332'>If I backed down I knew well what would come to me. </span>
<span sid='24333' title='24333'>Maybe I'm a coward. </span>
<span sid='24334' title='24334'>Maybe it's the thought of my poor little woman and the children that makes me one. </span>
<span sid='24335' title='24335'>Anyhow, I went. </span>
<span sid='24336' title='24336'>I guess it will haunt me for ever.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24337' title='24337'>'It was a lonely house, twenty miles from here, over the range yonder. </span>
<span sid='24338' title='24338'>I was told off for the door, same as you were last night. </span>
<span sid='24339' title='24339'>They could not trust me with the job. </span>
<span sid='24340' title='24340'>The others went in. </span>
<span sid='24341' title='24341'>When they came out their hands were crimson to the wrists. </span>
<span sid='24342' title='24342'>As we turned away a child was screaming out of the house behind us. </span>
<span sid='24343' title='24343'>It was a boy of five who had seen his father murdered. </span>
<span sid='24344' title='24344'>I nearly fainted with the horror of it, and yet I had to keep a bold and smiling face; for well I knew that if I did not it would be out of my house that they would come next with their bloody hands, and it would be my little Fred that would be screaming for his father.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24345' title='24345'>'But I was a criminal then - part sharer in a murder, lost for ever in this world, and lost also in the next. </span>
<span sid='24346' title='24346'>I am a good Catholic, but the priest would have no word with me when he heard I was a Scowrer, and I am excommunicated from my faith. </span>
<span sid='24347' title='24347'>That's how it stands with me. </span>
<span sid='24348' title='24348'>And I see you going down the same road, and I ask you what the end is to be? </span>
<span sid='24349' title='24349'>Are you ready to be a cold-blooded murderer also, or can we do anything to stop it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24350' title='24350'>'What would you do?' asked McMurdo, abruptly. </span>
<span sid='24351' title='24351'>'You would not inform?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24352' title='24352'>'God forbid!' cried Morris. </span>
<span sid='24353' title='24353'>'Sure, the very thought would cost me my Life.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24354' title='24354'>That's well,' said McMurdo. </span>
<span sid='24355' title='24355'>'I'm thinking that you are a weak man, and that you make too much of the matter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24356' title='24356'>'Too much! </span>
<span sid='24357' title='24357'>Wait till you have lived here longer. </span>
<span sid='24358' title='24358'>Look down the valley! </span>
<span sid='24359' title='24359'>See the cloud of a hundred chimneys that over-shadows it. </span>
<span sid='24360' title='24360'>I tell you that the cloud of murder hangs thicker and lower than that over the heads of the people. </span>
<span sid='24361' title='24361'>It is the Valley of Fear - the Valley of Death. </span>
<span sid='24362' title='24362'>The terror is in the hearts of the people from the dusk to the dawn. </span>
<span sid='24363' title='24363'>Wait, young man, and you will learn for yourself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24364' title='24364'>'Well, let you know what I think when I have seen more,' said McMurdo carelessly. </span>
<span sid='24365' title='24365'>'What is very clear is that you are not the man for the place, and that the sooner you sell out - if you only get a dime a dollar for what the business is worth - the better it will be for you. </span>
<span sid='24366' title='24366'>What you have said is safe with me, but, by Gar! if I thought you were an informer-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24367' title='24367'>'No, no!' cried Morris piteously.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24368' title='24368'>'Well, let it rest at that. </span>
<span sid='24369' title='24369'>I'll bear what you have said in mind, and maybe some day I'll come back to it. </span>
<span sid='24370' title='24370'>I expect you meant kindly by speaking to me like this. </span>
<span sid='24371' title='24371'>Now I'll be getting home.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24372' title='24372'>'One word before you go,' said Morris. </span>
<span sid='24373' title='24373'>'We may have been seen together. </span>
<span sid='24374' title='24374'>They may want to know what we have spoken about.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24375' title='24375'>'Ah! that's well thought of.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24376' title='24376'>'I offer you a clerkship in my store.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24377' title='24377'>'And I refuse it. </span>
<span sid='24378' title='24378'>That's our business. </span>
<span sid='24379' title='24379'>Well, so long, Brother Morris, and may you find things go better with you in the future.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24380' title='24380'>That same afternoon, as McMurdo sat smoking, lost in thought, beside the stove of his sitting-room, the door swung open, and its framework was filled with the huge figure of Boss McGinty. </span>
<span sid='24381' title='24381'>He passed the sign, and then, seating himself opposite to the young man, he looked at him steadily for some time, a look which was as steadily returned.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24382' title='24382'>'I'm not much of a visitor, Brother McMurdo,' he said at last. </span>
<span sid='24383' title='24383'>'I guess I am too busy over the folk that visit me. </span>
<span sid='24384' title='24384'>But I thought I'd stretch a point and drop down to see you in your own house.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24385' title='24385'>'I'm proud to see you here, Councillor,' McMurdo answered, heartily, bringing his whiskey-bottle out of the cupboard. </span>
<span sid='24386' title='24386'>'It's an honour that I had not expected.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24387' title='24387'>'How's the arm?' asked the Boss.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24388' title='24388'>McMurdo made a wry face. </span>
<span sid='24389' title='24389'>'Well, I'm not forgetting it,' he aid. </span>
<span sid='24390' title='24390'>'But it's worth it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24391' title='24391'>'Yes, it's worth it,' the other answered, 'to those that are loyal, and go through with it, and are a help to the Lodge. </span>
<span sid='24392' title='24392'>What were you speaking to Brother Morris about on Miller Hill this morning?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24393' title='24393'>The question came so suddenly that it was well that he had his answer prepared. </span>
<span sid='24394' title='24394'>He burst into a hearty laugh. </span>
<span sid='24395' title='24395'>'Morris didn't know I could earn a living here at home. </span>
<span sid='24396' title='24396'>He sha'n't know either, for he has got too much conscience for the likes of me. </span>
<span sid='24397' title='24397'>But he's a good-hearted old chap. </span>
<span sid='24398' title='24398'>It was his idea that I was at a lose end, and that he would do me a good turn by offering me a clerkship in a dry-goods store.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24399' title='24399'>'Oh, that was it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24400' title='24400'>'Yes, that was it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24401' title='24401'>'And you refused it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24402' title='24402'>'Sure. </span>
<span sid='24403' title='24403'>Couldn't I earn ten times as much in my own bedroom with four hours' work?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24404' title='24404'>'That's so. </span>
<span sid='24405' title='24405'>But I wouldn't get about too much with Morris.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24406' title='24406'>'Why not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24407' title='24407'>'Well', I guess because I tell you not. </span>
<span sid='24408' title='24408'>That's enough for most folk in these parts.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24409' title='24409'>'It may be enough for most folks; but it ain't enough for me, Councillor,' said McMurdo boldly. </span>
<span sid='24410' title='24410'>'If you are a judge of men you'll know that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24411' title='24411'>The swarthy giant glared at him, and bis hairy paw closed for an instant round the glass as though he would hurl it at the head of his companion. </span>
<span sid='24412' title='24412'>Then he laughed in his loud, boisterous, insincere fashion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24413' title='24413'>'You're a queer card, for sure,' said he. </span>
<span sid='24414' title='24414'>'Well, if you want reasons, give them. </span>
<span sid='24415' title='24415'>Did Morris say nothing to you against the Lodge?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24416' title='24416'>'Nor against me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24417' title='24417'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24418' title='24418'>'Well, that's because he daren't trust you. </span>
<span sid='24419' title='24419'>But in bis heart he is not a loyal brother. </span>
<span sid='24420' title='24420'>We know that well. </span>
<span sid='24421' title='24421'>So we watch him, and we wait for the time to admonish him. </span>
<span sid='24422' title='24422'>I'm thinking that the time is drawing near. </span>
<span sid='24423' title='24423'>There's no room for scabby sheep in our pen. </span>
<span sid='24424' title='24424'>But if you keep company with a disloyal man, we might think that you were disloyal, too. </span>
<span sid='24425' title='24425'>See?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24426' title='24426'>There's no chance of my keeping company with him; for I dislike the man,' McMurdo answered. </span>
<span sid='24427' title='24427'>'As to being disloyal, if it was any man but you, he would not use the word to me twice.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24428' title='24428'>'Well, that's enough,' said McGinty, draining off his glass. </span>
<span sid='24429' title='24429'>'I came down to give you a word in season, and you've had it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24430' title='24430'>'I'd like to know,' said McMurdo, 'how you ever came to learn that I had spoken with Morris at all.'</span>
<span sid='24431' title='24431'>McGinty laughed. </span>
<span sid='24432' title='24432'>'It's my business to know what goes on in this township,' said he. </span>
<span sid='24433' title='24433'>'I guess you'd best reckon on my hearing all that passes. </span>
<span sid='24434' title='24434'>Well, time's up, and I'll just say-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24435' title='24435'>But his leave-taking was cut short in a very unexpected fashion. </span>
<span sid='24436' title='24436'>With a sudden crash the door flew open, and three frowning, intent faces glared in at them from under the peaks of police caps. </span>
<span sid='24437' title='24437'>McMurdo sprang to his feet and half drew his revolver; but his arm stopped midway as he became conscious that two <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Winchester&t=h'>Winchester</a> rifles were levelled at his head. </span>
<span sid='24438' title='24438'>A man in uniform advanced into the room, a six-shooter in his hand. </span>
<span sid='24439' title='24439'>It was Captain Marvin, once of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>, and now of the Coal and Iron Constabulary. </span>
<span sid='24440' title='24440'>He shook his head with a half smile at McMurdo.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24441' title='24441'>'I thought you'd be getting into trouble, Mr Crooked McMurdo of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>,' said he. </span>
<span sid='24442' title='24442'>'Can't keep out of it, can you? </span>
<span sid='24443' title='24443'>Take your hat and come along with us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24444' title='24444'>'I guess you'll pay for this, Captain Marvin,' said McGinty. </span>
<span sid='24445' title='24445'>'Who are you, I'd like to know, to break into a house in this fashion and molest honest, law-abiding men?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24446' title='24446'>'You're standing out in this deal, Councillor McGinty,' said the police captain. </span>
<span sid='24447' title='24447'>'We are not out after you, but after this man McMurdo. </span>
<span sid='24448' title='24448'>It is for you to help, not to hinder us in our duty.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24449' title='24449'>'He is a friend of mine, and I'll answer for his conduct,' said the Boss.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24450' title='24450'>'By all accounts, Mr McGinty, you may have to answer for your own conduct some of these days,' the police captain answered. </span>
<span sid='24451' title='24451'>'This man McMurdo was a crook before ever he came here, and he's a crook still. </span>
<span sid='24452' title='24452'>Cover him, Patrolman, while I disarm him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24453' title='24453'>There's my pistol,' said McMurdo, coolly. </span>
<span sid='24454' title='24454'>'Maybe, Captain Marvin, if you and I were alone and face to face, you would not take me so easily.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24455' title='24455'>'Where's your warrant?' asked McGinty. </span>
<span sid='24456' title='24456'>'By Gar! a man might as well live in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Russia&t=h'>Russia</a> as in Vermissa while folk like you are running the police. </span>
<span sid='24457' title='24457'>It's a capitalist outrage, and you'll hear more of it, I reckon.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24458' title='24458'>'You do what you think is your duty the best way you can, Councillor. </span>
<span sid='24459' title='24459'>We'll look after ours.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24460' title='24460'>'What am I accused of?' asked McMurdo.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24461' title='24461'>'Of being concerned in the beating of old Editor Stanger at the Herald office. </span>
<span sid='24462' title='24462'>It wasn't your fault that it isn't a murder charge.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24463' title='24463'>'Well, if that's all you have against him,' cried McGinty with a laugh, 'you can save yourself a deal of trouble by dropping it right now. </span>
<span sid='24464' title='24464'>This man was with me in my saloon playing poker up to midnight, and I can bring a dozen to prove it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24465' title='24465'>'That's your affair, and I guess you can settle it in court tomorrow. </span>
<span sid='24466' title='24466'>Meanwhile, come on, McMurdo, and come quietly if you don't want a gun across your head. </span>
<span sid='24467' title='24467'>You stand wide, Mr McGinty; for I warn you I will brook no resistance when I am on duty!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24468' title='24468'>So determined was the appearance of the captain that both McMurdo and his Boss were forced to accept the situation. </span>
<span sid='24469' title='24469'>The latter managed to have a few whispered words with the prisoner before they parted.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24470' title='24470'>'What about-' </span>
<span sid='24471' title='24471'>He jerked his thumb upwards to signify the coining plant.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24472' title='24472'>'All right,' whispered McMurdo, who had devised a safe hiding-place under the floor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24473' title='24473'>'I'll bid you good-bye,' said the Boss, shaking hands. </span>
<span sid='24474' title='24474'>'I'll see Reilly, the lawyer, and take the defence upon myself. </span>
<span sid='24475' title='24475'>Take my word for it that they won't be able to hold you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24476' title='24476'>'I wouldn't bet on that. </span>
<span sid='24477' title='24477'>Guard the prisoner, you two, and shoot him if he tries any games. </span>
<span sid='24478' title='24478'>I'll search the house before I leave.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24479' title='24479'>Marvin did so, but apparently found no trace of the concealed plant. </span>
<span sid='24480' title='24480'>When he had descended he and bis men escorted McMurdo Lo headquarters. </span>
<span sid='24481' title='24481'>Darkness had fallen, and a keen blizzard was blowing, so that the streets were nearly deserted; but a few loiterers followed the group and emboldened by invisibility shouted imprecations at the prisoner.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24482' title='24482'>'Lynch the cursed Scowrer!' they cried. </span>
<span sid='24483' title='24483'>'Lynch him!' </span>
<span sid='24484' title='24484'>They laughed and jeered as he was pushed into the police station. </span>
<span sid='24485' title='24485'>After a short formal examination from the inspector in-charge, he was handed on to the common cell. </span>
<span sid='24486' title='24486'>Here he found Baldwin and three other criminals of the night before, all arrested that afternoon, and waiting their trial next morning.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24487' title='24487'>But even within this inner fortress of the law the long arm of the Freemen was able to extend. </span>
<span sid='24488' title='24488'>Late at night there came a jailer with a straw bundle for their bedding, out of which he extracted two bottles of whiskey, some glasses, and a pack of cards. </span>
<span sid='24489' title='24489'>They spent a hilarious night without an anxious thought as to the ordeal of the morning.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24490' title='24490'>Nor had they cause, as the result was to show. </span>
<span sid='24491' title='24491'>The magistrate could not possibly, on the evidence, have held them for a higher court. </span>
<span sid='24492' title='24492'>On the one hand, the compositors and pressmen were forced to admit that the light was uncertain, that they were themselves much perturbed, and that it was difficult for them to swear to the identity of the assailants, although they believed that the accused were among them. </span>
<span sid='24493' title='24493'>Cross-examined by the clever attorney who had been engaged by McGinty, they were even more nebulous in their evidence.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24494' title='24494'>The injured man had already deposed that he was so taken by surprise by the suddenness of the attack that he could state nothing beyond the fact that the first man who struck him wore a moustache. </span>
<span sid='24495' title='24495'>He added that he knew them to be Scowrers, since no one else in the community could possibly have any enmity to him, and he had long been threatened on account of his outspoken editorials. </span>
<span sid='24496' title='24496'>On the other hand, it was clearly shown by the united and unfaltering evidence of six citizens, including that high municipal official Councillor McGinty, that the men had been at a card party at the Union House until an hour very much later than the commission of the outrage.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24497' title='24497'>Needless to say that they were discharged with something very near to an apology from the Bench for the inconvenience to which they had been put, together with an implied censure of Captain Marvin and the police for their officious zeal.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24498' title='24498'>The verdict was greeted with loud applause by a Court in which McMurdo saw many familiar faces. </span>
<span sid='24499' title='24499'>Brothers of the Lodge smiled and waved. </span>
<span sid='24500' title='24500'>But there were others who sat with compressed lips and brooding eyes as the men filed out of the dock. </span>
<span sid='24501' title='24501'>One of them, a little dark-bearded, resolute fellow, put the thoughts of himself and comrades into words as the ex-prisoners passed him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24502' title='24502'>'You damned murderers!' he said. </span>
<span sid='24503' title='24503'>'We'll fix you yet.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24504' title='24504'>CHAPTER 5 : The Darkest Hour</span>
<p>
<span sid='24505' title='24505'>If anything had been needed to give an impetus to Jack McMurdo's popularity among his fellows, it would have been his arrest and acquittal. </span>
<span sid='24506' title='24506'>That a man on the very night of joining the Lodge should have done something which brought him before the magistrate was a new record in the annals of the society. </span>
<span sid='24507' title='24507'>Already he had earned the reputation of a good boon companion, a cheery reveller, and withal a man of high temper, who would not take an insult even from the all-powerful Boss himself. </span>
<span sid='24508' title='24508'>But, in addition to this, he impressed his comrades with the idea that among them all there was not one whose brain was so ready to devise a bloodthirsty scheme, or whose hand would be more capable of carrying it out. </span>
<span sid='24509' title='24509'>'He'll be the boy for the clean job,' said the oldsters to each other, and waited their time until they could set him to his work.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24510' title='24510'>McGinty had instruments enough already but he recognized that this was a supremely able one. </span>
<span sid='24511' title='24511'>He felt like a man holding a fierce bloodhound in leash. </span>
<span sid='24512' title='24512'>There were curs to do the smaller work, but some day he would slip this creature upon its prey. </span>
<span sid='24513' title='24513'>A few members of the Lodge, Ted Baldwin among them, resented the rapid rise of the stranger, and hated him for it, but they kept clear of him, for he was as ready to fight as to laugh.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24514' title='24514'>But if he gained favour with his fellows, there was another quarter, one which had become even more vital to him, in which he lost it. </span>
<span sid='24515' title='24515'>Ettie Shafter's father would have nothing more to do with him, nor would he allow him to enter the house. </span>
<span sid='24516' title='24516'>Ettie herself was too deeply in love to give him up altogether, and yet her own good sense warned her of what would come from a marriage with a man who was regarded as a criminal.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24517' title='24517'>One morning after a sleepless night she determined to see him, possibly for the last time, and make one strong endeavour to draw him from those evil influences which were sucking him down. </span>
<span sid='24518' title='24518'>She went to his house, as he had often begged her to do, and made her way into the room which he used as his sitting-room. </span>
<span sid='24519' title='24519'>He was seated at a table with his back turned and a letter in front of him. </span>
<span sid='24520' title='24520'>A sudden spirit of girlish mischief came over her - she was still only nineteen. </span>
<span sid='24521' title='24521'>He had not heard her when she pushed open the door. </span>
<span sid='24522' title='24522'>Now she tip-toed forward, and laid her hand lightly upon his bended shoulders.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24523' title='24523'>If she had expected to startle him, she certainly succeeded; but only in turn to be startled herself. </span>
<span sid='24524' title='24524'>With a tiger spring he turned on her, and his right hand was feeling for her throat. </span>
<span sid='24525' title='24525'>At the same instant, with the other hand he crumpled up the paper that lay before him. </span>
<span sid='24526' title='24526'>For an instant he stood glaring. </span>
<span sid='24527' title='24527'>Then astonishment and joy took the place of the ferocity which had convulsed his features - a ferocity which had sent her shrinking back in horror as from something which had never before intruded into her gentle life.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24528' title='24528'>'It's you!' said he, mopping his brow. </span>
<span sid='24529' title='24529'>'And to think that you should come to me, heart of my heart, and I should find nothing better to do than to want to strangle you! </span>
<span sid='24530' title='24530'>Come then, darling,' and he held out his arms let me make it up to you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24531' title='24531'>But she had not recovered from that sudden glimpse of guilty fear which she had read in the man's face. </span>
<span sid='24532' title='24532'>All her woman's instinct told her that it was not the mere fright of a man who is startled. </span>
<span sid='24533' title='24533'>Guilt - that was it - guilt and fear.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24534' title='24534'>'What's come over you, Jack?' she cried. </span>
<span sid='24535' title='24535'>'Why were you so scared of me? </span>
<span sid='24536' title='24536'>Oh, Jack, if your conscience was at ease, you would not have looked at me like that!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24537' title='24537'>'Sure, I was thinking of other things, and when you came tripping so lightly on those fairy feet of yours-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24538' title='24538'>'No, no; it was more than that, Jack.' </span>
<span sid='24539' title='24539'>Then a sudden suspicion seized her. </span>
<span sid='24540' title='24540'>'Let me see that letter you were writing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24541' title='24541'>'Ah, Ettie, I couldn't do that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24542' title='24542'>Her suspicions became certainties.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24543' title='24543'>'It's to another woman!' she cried. </span>
<span sid='24544' title='24544'>'I know it. </span>
<span sid='24545' title='24545'>Why else should you hold it from me? </span>
<span sid='24546' title='24546'>Was it to your wife that you were writing? </span>
<span sid='24547' title='24547'>How am I to know that you are not a married man - you, a stranger, that nobody knows?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24548' title='24548'>'I am not married, Ettie. </span>
<span sid='24549' title='24549'>See now, I swear it. </span>
<span sid='24550' title='24550'>You're the only one woman on earth to me. </span>
<span sid='24551' title='24551'>By the Cross of Christ, I swear it!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24552' title='24552'>He was so white with passionate earnestness that she could not but believe him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24553' title='24553'>'Well, then,' she cried, 'why will you not show me the letter?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24554' title='24554'>'I'll tell you, acushla,' said he. </span>
<span sid='24555' title='24555'>'I'm under oath not to show it, and just as I wouldn't break my word to you, so I would keep it to those who hold my promise. </span>
<span sid='24556' title='24556'>It's the business of the Lodge, and even to you it's secret. </span>
<span sid='24557' title='24557'>And if I was scared when a hand fell on me, can't you understand it when it might have been the hand of a detective?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24558' title='24558'>She felt that he was telling the truth. </span>
<span sid='24559' title='24559'>He gathered her into his arms, and kissed away her fears and doubts.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24560' title='24560'>'Sit here by me, then. </span>
<span sid='24561' title='24561'>It's a queer throne for such a queen, but it's the best your poor lover can find. </span>
<span sid='24562' title='24562'>He'll do better for you some of these days, I'm thinking. </span>
<span sid='24563' title='24563'>Now your mind is easy once again, is it not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24564' title='24564'>'How can it ever be at ease, Jack, when I know that you are a criminal among criminals - when I never know the day that I may hear that you are in the dock for murder? </span>
<span sid='24565' title='24565'>McMurdo the Scowrer - that was what one of our boarders called you yesterday. </span>
<span sid='24566' title='24566'>It went through my heart like a knife.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24567' title='24567'>'Sure, hard words break no bones.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24568' title='24568'>'But they were true.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24569' title='24569'>'Well, dear, it's not as bad as you think. </span>
<span sid='24570' title='24570'>We are but poor men that are trying in our own way to get our rights.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24571' title='24571'>Ettie threw her arms round her lover's neck. </span>
<span sid='24572' title='24572'>'Give it up, Jack! </span>
<span sid='24573' title='24573'>For my sake - for God's sake, give it up! </span>
<span sid='24574' title='24574'>It was to ask you that I came here today. </span>
<span sid='24575' title='24575'>Oh, Jack, see - I beg it of you on my bended knees. </span>
<span sid='24576' title='24576'>Kneeling here before you, I implore you to give it up!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24577' title='24577'>He raised her, and soothed her with her head against his breast.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24578' title='24578'>'Sure, my darlin', you don't know what it is you are asking. </span>
<span sid='24579' title='24579'>How could I give it up when it would be to break my oath and to desert my comrades? </span>
<span sid='24580' title='24580'>If you could see how things stand with me, you could never ask it of me. </span>
<span sid='24581' title='24581'>Besides, if I wanted to, how could I do it? </span>
<span sid='24582' title='24582'>You don't suppose that the Lodge would let a man go free with all its secrets?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24583' title='24583'>'I've thought of that, Jack. </span>
<span sid='24584' title='24584'>I've planned it all. </span>
<span sid='24585' title='24585'>Father has saved some money. </span>
<span sid='24586' title='24586'>He is weary of this place, where the fear of these people darkens our lives. </span>
<span sid='24587' title='24587'>He is ready to go. </span>
<span sid='24588' title='24588'>We would fly together to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Philadelphia&t=h'>Philadelphia</a> or New <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=York&t=h'>York</a>, where we would be safe from them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24589' title='24589'>McMurdo laughed. </span>
<span sid='24590' title='24590'>'The Lodge has a long arm. </span>
<span sid='24591' title='24591'>Do you think it could not stretch from here to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Philadelphia&t=h'>Philadelphia</a> or New <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=York&t=h'>York</a>?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24592' title='24592'>'Well, then, to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the West&t=h'>the West</a>, or to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, or to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Germany&t=h'>Germany</a> whence father came. </span>
<span sid='24593' title='24593'>Anywhere to get away from this Valley of Fear!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24594' title='24594'>McMurdo thought of old Brother Morris. </span>
<span sid='24595' title='24595'>'Sure, it is the second time I have heard the valley so named,' said he. </span>
<span sid='24596' title='24596'>'The shadow does indeed seem to lie heavy on some of you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24597' title='24597'>'It darkens every moment of our lives. </span>
<span sid='24598' title='24598'>Do you suppose that Ted Baldwin has ever forgiven us? </span>
<span sid='24599' title='24599'>If it were not that he fears you, what do you suppose that our chances would be? </span>
<span sid='24600' title='24600'>If you saw the look in those dark, hungry eyes of his when they fall on me!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24601' title='24601'>'By Gar! </span>
<span sid='24602' title='24602'>I'd teach him better manners if I caught him at it! </span>
<span sid='24603' title='24603'>But see here, little girl. </span>
<span sid='24604' title='24604'>I can't leave here. </span>
<span sid='24605' title='24605'>I can't. </span>
<span sid='24606' title='24606'>Take that from me once and for all. </span>
<span sid='24607' title='24607'>But if you will leave me to find my own way, I will try to prepare a way of getting honourably out of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24608' title='24608'>'There is no honour in such a matter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24609' title='24609'>'Well, well, it's just how you look at it. </span>
<span sid='24610' title='24610'>But if you'll give me six months I'll work it so as I can leave without being ashamed to look others in the face.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24611' title='24611'>The girl laughed with joy. </span>
<span sid='24612' title='24612'>'Six months!' she cried. </span>
<span sid='24613' title='24613'>'Is it a promise?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24614' title='24614'>'Well, it may be seven or eight. </span>
<span sid='24615' title='24615'>But within a year at the farthest we will leave the valley behind us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24616' title='24616'>It was the most that Ettie could obtain, and yet it was something. </span>
<span sid='24617' title='24617'>There was this distant light to illuminate the gloom of the immediate future. </span>
<span sid='24618' title='24618'>She returned to her father's house more lighthearted than she had ever been since Jack McMurdo had come into her life.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24619' title='24619'>It might be thought that as a member all the doings of the society would be told to him, but he was soon to discover that the organization was wider and more complex than the simple Lodge. </span>
<span sid='24620' title='24620'>Even Boss McGinty was ignorant as to many things, for there was an official named the County Delegate, living at Hobson's Patch, farther down the line, who had power over several different lodges, which he wielded in a sudden and arbitrary way. </span>
<span sid='24621' title='24621'>Only once did McMurdo see him, a sly little grey-haired rat of a man with a slinking gait and a sidelong glance which was charged with malice. </span>
<span sid='24622' title='24622'>Evans Putt was his name, and even the great Boss of Vermissa felt towards him something of the repulsion and fear which the huge Danton may have felt for the puny but dangerous Robespierre.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24623' title='24623'>One day Scanlan, who was McMurdo's fellow-boarder, received a note from McGinty enclosing one from Evans Pott, which informed him that he was sending over two good men, Lawler and Andrews, who had instructions to act in the neighbourhood; though it was best for the cause that no particulars as to their objects should be given. </span>
<span sid='24624' title='24624'>Would the Bodymaster see to it that suitable arrangements be made for their lodgings and comfort until the time for action should arrive? </span>
<span sid='24625' title='24625'>McGinty added that it was impossible for anyone to remain secret at the Union House, and that, therefore, he would be obliged if McMurdo and Scanlan would put the strangers up for a few days in their boarding-house.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24626' title='24626'>The same evening the two men arrived, each carrying his grip-sack. </span>
<span sid='24627' title='24627'>Lawler was an elderly man, shrewd, silent, and self-contained, clad in an old black frock-coat, which, with his soft felt hat and ragged, grizzled beard, gave him a general resemblance to an itinerant preacher. </span>
<span sid='24628' title='24628'>His companion, Andrews, was little more than a boy, frank-faced and cheerful, with the breezy manner of one who is out for a holiday, and means to enjoy every minute of it. </span>
<span sid='24629' title='24629'>Both of the men were total abstainers, and behaved in all ways as exemplary members of society, with the one single exception that they were assassins who had often proved themselves to be most capable instruments for this Association of murder. </span>
<span sid='24630' title='24630'>Lawler had already carried out fourteen commissions of the kind, and Andrews three.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24631' title='24631'>They were, as McMurdo found, quite ready to converse about their deeds in the past, which they recounted with the half-bashful pride of men who had done good and unselfish service for the community. </span>
<span sid='24632' title='24632'>They were reticent, however, as to the immediate job in hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24633' title='24633'>'They chose us because neither I nor the boy here drink,' Lawler explained. </span>
<span sid='24634' title='24634'>'They can count on us saying no more than we should. </span>
<span sid='24635' title='24635'>You must not take it amiss, but it is the orders of the County Delegate that we obey.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24636' title='24636'>'Sure, we are all in it together,' said Scanlan, McMurdo's mate, as the four sat together at supper.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24637' title='24637'>'That's true enough, and we'll talk till the cows come home of the killing of Charlie Williams, or of Simon Bird, or any other job in the past. </span>
<span sid='24638' title='24638'>But till the work is done we say nothing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24639' title='24639'>'There are half a dozen about here that I have a word to say to,' said McMurdo, with an oath. </span>
<span sid='24640' title='24640'>'I suppose it isn't Jack Knox, of Ironhill, that you are after? </span>
<span sid='24641' title='24641'>I'd go some way to see him get his deserts.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24642' title='24642'>'No; it's not him yet.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24643' title='24643'>'Or Herman Strauss?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24644' title='24644'>'No, nor him either.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24645' title='24645'>'Well, if you won't tell us, we can't make you; but I'd be glad to know.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24646' title='24646'>Lawler smiled, and shook his head. </span>
<span sid='24647' title='24647'>He was not to be drawn.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24648' title='24648'>In spite of the reticence of their guests, Scanlan and McMurdo were quite determined to be present at what they called the 'fun'. </span>
<span sid='24649' title='24649'>When, therefore, at an early hour one morning McMurdo heard them creeping down the stairs, he awakened Scanlan, and the two hurried on their clothes. </span>
<span sid='24650' title='24650'>When they were dressed they found that the others had stolen out, leaving the door open behind them. </span>
<span sid='24651' title='24651'>It was not yet dawn, and by the light of the lamps they could see the two men some distance down the street. </span>
<span sid='24652' title='24652'>They followed them warily, treading noiselessly in the deep snow.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24653' title='24653'>The boarding-house was near the edge of the town, and soon they were at the crossroads which is beyond its boundary. </span>
<span sid='24654' title='24654'>Here three men were waiting, with whom Lawler and Andrews held a short, eager conversation. </span>
<span sid='24655' title='24655'>Then they all moved on together. </span>
<span sid='24656' title='24656'>It was clearly some notable job which needed numbers. </span>
<span sid='24657' title='24657'>At this point there are several trails which lead to various mines. </span>
<span sid='24658' title='24658'>The strangers took that which led to the Crow Hill, a huge business which was in strong hands, who had been able, thanks to their energetic and fearless New <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> manager, Josiah H. Dunn, to keep some order and discipline during the long reign of terror.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24659' title='24659'>Day was breaking now, and a line of workmen were slowly making their way, singly and in groups, along the blackened path.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24660' title='24660'>McMurdo and Scanlan strolled on with the others, keeping in sight of the men whom they followed. </span>
<span sid='24661' title='24661'>A thick mist lay over them, and from the heart of it there came the sudden scream of a steam whistle. </span>
<span sid='24662' title='24662'>It was the ten-minute signal before the cages descended and the day's labour began.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24663' title='24663'>When they reached the open space round the mineshaft there were a hundred miners waiting, stamping their feet and blowing on their fingers; for it was bitterly cold. </span>
<span sid='24664' title='24664'>The strangers stood in a little group under the shadow of the engine-house. </span>
<span sid='24665' title='24665'>Scanlan and McMurdo climbed a heap of slag from which the whole scene lay before them. </span>
<span sid='24666' title='24666'>They saw the mine engineer, a great bearded Scotchman named Menzies, come out of the engine-house and blow his whistle for the cages to be lowered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24667' title='24667'>At the same instant a tall, loose-framed young man with a clean-shaven, earnest face, advanced eagerly towards the pithead. </span>
<span sid='24668' title='24668'>As he came forward his eyes fell upon the group, silent and motionless, under the engine-house. </span>
<span sid='24669' title='24669'>The men had drawn down their hats and turned up their collars to screen their faces. </span>
<span sid='24670' title='24670'>For a moment the presentiment of Death laid its cold hand upon the manager's heart. </span>
<span sid='24671' title='24671'>At the next he had shaken it off and saw only his duty towards intrusive strangers.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24672' title='24672'>'Who are you?' he asked, as he advanced. </span>
<span sid='24673' title='24673'>'What are you loitering there for?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24674' title='24674'>There was no answer, but the lad Andrews stepped forward and shot him in the stomach. </span>
<span sid='24675' title='24675'>The hundred waiting miners stood as motionless and helpless as if they were paralysed. </span>
<span sid='24676' title='24676'>The manager clapped his two hands to the wound and doubled himself up. </span>
<span sid='24677' title='24677'>Then he staggered away, but another of the assassins fired, and he went down sideways, kicking and clawing among a heap of clinkers. </span>
<span sid='24678' title='24678'>Menzies, the Scotchman, gave a roar of rage at the sight and rushed with an iron spanner at the murderers; but was met by two balls in the face, which dropped him dead at their very feet.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24679' title='24679'>There was a surge forward of some of the miners, and an inarticulate cry of pity and of anger; but a couple of the strangers emptied their six-shooters over the heads of the crowd, and they broke and scattered, some of them rushing wildly back to their homes in Vermissa.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24680' title='24680'>When a few of the bravest had rallied, and there was a return to the mine, the murderous gang had vanished in the mists of the morning, without a single witness being able to swear to the identity of these men who in front of a hundred spectators had wrought this double crime.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24681' title='24681'>Scanlan and McMurdo made their way back, Scanlan somewhat subdued, for it was the first murder job that he had seen with his own eyes, and it appeared less funny than he had been led to believe. </span>
<span sid='24682' title='24682'>The horrible screams of the dead manager's wife pursued them as they hurried to the town. </span>
<span sid='24683' title='24683'>McMurdo was absorbed and silent; but he showed no sympathy for the weakening of his companion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24684' title='24684'>'Sure, it is like a war,' he repeated. </span>
<span sid='24685' title='24685'>'What is it but a war between us and them, and we hit back where we best can?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24686' title='24686'>There was high revel in the Lodge room at the Union House that night, not only over the killing of the manager and engineer of the Crow Hill mine, which would bring this organization into line with the other blackmailed and terror-stricken companies of the district, but also over a distant triumph which had been wrought by the hands of the Lodge itself. </span>
<span sid='24687' title='24687'>It would appear that when the County Delegate had sent over five good men to strike a blow in Vermissa, he had demanded that, in return, three Vermissa men should be secretly selected and sent across to kill William Hales, of Stake Royal, one of the best-known and most popular mine-owners in the Gilmerton district, a man who was believed not to have an enemy in the world, for he was in all ways a pattern employer. </span>
<span sid='24688' title='24688'>He had insisted, however, upon efficiency in the work, and had therefore paid off certain drunken and idle employés who were members of the all-powerful society.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24689' title='24689'>Coffin notices hung outside his door had not weakened his resolution, and so in a free, civilized country he found himself condemned to death.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24690' title='24690'>The execution had now been duly carried out. </span>
<span sid='24691' title='24691'>Ted Baldwin, who sprawled in the seat of honour beside the Bodymaster, had been the chief of the party. </span>
<span sid='24692' title='24692'>His flushed face and glazed, bloodshot eyes told of sleeplessness and drink. </span>
<span sid='24693' title='24693'>He and his two comrades had spent the night before among the mountains. </span>
<span sid='24694' title='24694'>They were unkempt and weather-stained. </span>
<span sid='24695' title='24695'>But no heroes, returning from a forlorn hope, could have had a warmer welcome from their comrades.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24696' title='24696'>The story was told and retold amid cries of delight and shouts of laughter. </span>
<span sid='24697' title='24697'>They had waited for their man as he drove home at nightfall, taking their station at the top of a steep hill, where his horse must be at a walk. </span>
<span sid='24698' title='24698'>He was so furred to keep out the cold that he could not lay his hand on his pistol. </span>
<span sid='24699' title='24699'>They had pulled him out and shot him again and again.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24700' title='24700'>He had screamed for mercy. </span>
<span sid='24701' title='24701'>The screams were repeated for the amusement of the lodge. </span>
<span sid='24702' title='24702'>'Let's hear again how he squealed,' they cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24703' title='24703'>None of them knew the man, but there is eternal drama in a killing, and they had shown the Scowrers of Gilmerton that the Vermissa men were to be relied upon.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24704' title='24704'>There had been one contretemps, for a man and his wife had driven up while they were still emptying their revolvers into the silent body. </span>
<span sid='24705' title='24705'>It had been suggested that they should shoot them both; but they were harmless folk who were not connected with the mines, so they were sternly bidden to drive on and keep silent, lest a worse thing befall them. </span>
<span sid='24706' title='24706'>And so the blood-mottled figure had been left as a warning to all such hard-hearted employers, and the three noble avengers had hurried off into the mountains where unbroken Nature comes down to the very edge of the furnaces and the slag- heaps. </span>
<span sid='24707' title='24707'>Here they were safe and sound, their work well done, and the plaudits of their companions in their ears.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24708' title='24708'>It had been a great day for the Scowrers. </span>
<span sid='24709' title='24709'>The shadow had fallen even darker over the valley. </span>
<span sid='24710' title='24710'>But as the wise general chooses the moment of victory in which to redouble his efforts, so that his foes may have no time to steady themselves after disaster, so Boss McGinty, looking out upon the scene of his operations with his brooding and malicious eyes, had devised a new attack upon those who opposed him. </span>
<span sid='24711' title='24711'>That very night, as the half-drunken company broke up, he touched McMurdo on the arm and led him aside into the inner room where they had their first interview.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24712' title='24712'>'See here, my lad,' said he, 'I've got a job that's worthy of you at last. </span>
<span sid='24713' title='24713'>You'll have the doing of it in your own hands.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24714' title='24714'>'Proud I am to hear it,' McMurdo answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24715' title='24715'>'You can take two men with you - Manders and Reilly. </span>
<span sid='24716' title='24716'>They have been warned for service. </span>
<span sid='24717' title='24717'>We'll never be right in this district until Chester Wilcox has been settled, and you'll have the thanks of every Lodge in the coalfields if you can down him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24718' title='24718'>'I'll do my best, anyhow. </span>
<span sid='24719' title='24719'>Who is he, and where shall I find him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24720' title='24720'>McGinty took his eternal half-chewed, half-smoked cigar from the corner of his mouth, and proceeded to draw a rough diagram on a page torn from his notebook.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24721' title='24721'>'He's the chief foreman of the Iron Dyke Company. </span>
<span sid='24722' title='24722'>He's a hard citizen, an old colour-sergeant of the war, all scars and grizzle. </span>
<span sid='24723' title='24723'>We've had two tries at him, but had no luck, and Jim Carnaway lost his life over it. </span>
<span sid='24724' title='24724'>Now it's for you to take it over. </span>
<span sid='24725' title='24725'>That's the house, all alone at the Iron Dyke cross-road, same as you see here in the map, without another within earshot. </span>
<span sid='24726' title='24726'>It's no good by day. </span>
<span sid='24727' title='24727'>He's armed, and shoots quick and straight, with no questions asked. </span>
<span sid='24728' title='24728'>But at night - well, there he is, with his wife, three children, and a hired help. </span>
<span sid='24729' title='24729'>You can't pick or choose. </span>
<span sid='24730' title='24730'>It's all or none. </span>
<span sid='24731' title='24731'>If you could get a bag of blasting powder at the front door with a slow match to it-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24732' title='24732'>'What's the man done?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24733' title='24733'>'Didn't I tell you he shot Jim Carnaway?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24734' title='24734'>'Why did he shoot him?</span>
<p>
<span sid='24735' title='24735'>'What in thunder has that to do with you? </span>
<span sid='24736' title='24736'>Carnaway was about his house at night, and he shot him. </span>
<span sid='24737' title='24737'>That's enough for me and you. </span>
<span sid='24738' title='24738'>You've got to set the thing right.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24739' title='24739'>'There's these two women and the children. </span>
<span sid='24740' title='24740'>Do they go up, too?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24741' title='24741'>'They have to - else how can we get him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24742' title='24742'>'It seems hard on them, for they've done nothing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24743' title='24743'>'What sort of talk is this? </span>
<span sid='24744' title='24744'>Do you back out?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24745' title='24745'>'Easy, Councillor, easy. </span>
<span sid='24746' title='24746'>What have I ever said or done that you should think I would be after standing back from an order of the Bodymaster of my own Lodge? </span>
<span sid='24747' title='24747'>If it's right or if it's wrong it's for you to decide.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24748' title='24748'>'You'll do it, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24749' title='24749'>'Of course I will do it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24750' title='24750'>'When?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24751' title='24751'>'Well, you had best give me a night or two that I may see the house and make my plans. </span>
<span sid='24752' title='24752'>Then-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24753' title='24753'>'Very good,' said McGinty, shaking him by the hand. </span>
<span sid='24754' title='24754'>'I leave it with you. </span>
<span sid='24755' title='24755'>It will be a great day when you bring us the news. </span>
<span sid='24756' title='24756'>It's just the last stroke that will bring them all to their knees.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24757' title='24757'>McMurdo thought long and deeply over the commission which had been so suddenly placed in his hands. </span>
<span sid='24758' title='24758'>The isolated house in which Chester Wilcox lived was about five miles off in an adjacent valley. </span>
<span sid='24759' title='24759'>That very night he started off all alone to prepare for the attempt. </span>
<span sid='24760' title='24760'>It was daylight before he returned from his reconnaissance. </span>
<span sid='24761' title='24761'>Next day he interviewed his two subordinates, Manders and Reilly, reckless youngsters, who were as elated as if it were a deer hunt.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24762' title='24762'>Two nights later they met outside the town, all three armed, and one of them carrying a sack stuffed with the powder which was used in the quarries. </span>
<span sid='24763' title='24763'>It was two in the morning before they came to the lonely house. </span>
<span sid='24764' title='24764'>The night was a windy one, with broken clouds drifting swiftly across the face of a three-quarter moon. </span>
<span sid='24765' title='24765'>They had been warned to be on their guard against bloodhounds; so they moved forward cautiously, with their pistols cocked in their hands. </span>
<span sid='24766' title='24766'>But there was no sound save the howling of the wind and no movement but the swaying branches above them. </span>
<span sid='24767' title='24767'>McMurdo listened at the door of the lonely house; but all was still within. </span>
<span sid='24768' title='24768'>Then he leaned the powder bag against it, ripped a hole in it with his knife, and attached the fuse. </span>
<span sid='24769' title='24769'>When it was well alight, he and his two companions took to their heels, and were some distance off, safe arid snug in a sheltering ditch, before the shattering roar of the explosion, with the low, deep rumble of the collapsing building, told them that their work was done. </span>
<span sid='24770' title='24770'>No cleaner job had ever been carried out in the blood-stained annals of the society.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24771' title='24771'>But alas that work so well organized and boldly conceived should all have gone for nothing! </span>
<span sid='24772' title='24772'>Warned by the fate of the various victims, and knowing that he was marked down for destruction, Chester Wilcox had moved himself and his family only the day before to some safer and less known quarters, where a guard of police should watch over them. </span>
<span sid='24773' title='24773'>It was an empty house which had been torn down by the gunpowder, and the grim old colour-sergeant of the war was still teaching discipline to the miners of Iron Dyke.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24774' title='24774'>'Leave him to me,' said McMurdo. </span>
<span sid='24775' title='24775'>'He's my man, and I'll get him sure, if I have to wait a year for him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24776' title='24776'>A vote of thanks and confidence was passed in full Lodge, and so for the time the matter ended. </span>
<span sid='24777' title='24777'>When a few weeks later it was reported in the papers that Wilcox had been shot at from an ambuscade, it was an open secret that McMurdo was still at work upon his unfinished job.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24778' title='24778'>Such were the methods of the Society of Freemen, and such were the deeds of the Scowrers by which they spread their rule of fear over the great and rich district which was for so long a period haunted by their terrible presence. </span>
<span sid='24779' title='24779'>Why should these pages be stained by further crimes? </span>
<span sid='24780' title='24780'>Have I not said enough to show the men and their methods?</span>
<p>
<span sid='24781' title='24781'>These deeds are written in history, and there are records wherein one may read the details of them. </span>
<span sid='24782' title='24782'>There one may learn of the shooting of Policemen Hunt and Evans because they had ventured to arrest two members of the society - a double outrage planned at the Vermissa Lodge, and carried out in cold blood upon two helpless and disarmed men. </span>
<span sid='24783' title='24783'>There also one may read of the shooting of Mrs Larbey whilst she was nursing her husband, who had been beaten almost to death by orders of Boss McGinty.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24784' title='24784'>The killing of the elder Jenkins, shortly followed by that of his brother, the mutilation of James Murdoch, the blowing-up of the Staphouse family, and the murder of the Stendals all followed hard upon each other in the same terrible winter.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24785' title='24785'>Darkly the shadow lay upon the Valley of Fear. </span>
<span sid='24786' title='24786'>The spring had come with running brooks and blossoming trees. </span>
<span sid='24787' title='24787'>There was hope for all Nature, bound so long in an iron grip; but nowhere was there any hope for the men and women who lived under the yoke of the terror. </span>
<span sid='24788' title='24788'>Never had the cloud above them been so dark and hopeless as in the early summer of the year 1875.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24789' title='24789'>CHAPTER 6 : Danger</span>
<p>
<span sid='24790' title='24790'>It was the height of the reign of terror. </span>
<span sid='24791' title='24791'>McMurdo, who  had already been appointed Inner Deacon, with every prospect of some day succeeding McGinty as Bodymaster, was now so necessary to the councils of his comrades that nothing was done without his help and advice. </span>
<span sid='24792' title='24792'>The more popular he became, however, with the Freemen, the blacker were the scowls which greeted him as he passed along the streets of Vermissa. </span>
<span sid='24793' title='24793'>In spite of their terror the citizens were taking heart to bind themselves together against their oppressors. </span>
<span sid='24794' title='24794'>Rumours had reached the Lodge of secret gatherings in the Herald office and of distribution of firearms among the law-abiding people. </span>
<span sid='24795' title='24795'>But McGinty and his men were undisturbed by such reports. </span>
<span sid='24796' title='24796'>They were numerous, resolute, and well armed. </span>
<span sid='24797' title='24797'>Their opponents were scattered and powerless. </span>
<span sid='24798' title='24798'>It would all end, as it had done in the past, in aimless talk, and possibly in impotent arrests. </span>
<span sid='24799' title='24799'>So said McGinty, McMurdo, and all the bolder spirits.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24800' title='24800'>It was a Saturday evening in May. </span>
<span sid='24801' title='24801'>Saturday was always the Lodge night, and McMurdo was leaving his house to attend it when Morris, the weaker brother of the Order, came to see him. </span>
<span sid='24802' title='24802'>His brow was creased with care, and his kindly face was drawn and haggard.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24803' title='24803'>'Can I speak with you freely, Mr McMurdo?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24804' title='24804'>'Sure.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24805' title='24805'>'I can't forget that I spoke my heart to you once, and that you kept it to yourself, even though the Boss himself came to ask you about it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24806' title='24806'>'What else could I do if you trusted me? </span>
<span sid='24807' title='24807'>It wasn't that I agreed with what you said.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24808' title='24808'>'I know that well. </span>
<span sid='24809' title='24809'>But you are the one here I can speak to and be safe. </span>
<span sid='24810' title='24810'>I've a secret here' - he put his hand to his breast - 'and it is just burning the life out of me. </span>
<span sid='24811' title='24811'>I wish it had come to any one of you but me. </span>
<span sid='24812' title='24812'>If I tell it, it will mean murder, for sure. </span>
<span sid='24813' title='24813'>If I don't, it may bring the end of us all. </span>
<span sid='24814' title='24814'>God help me, but I am near out of my wits over it!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24815' title='24815'>McMurdo looked at the man earnestly. </span>
<span sid='24816' title='24816'>He was trembling in every limb. </span>
<span sid='24817' title='24817'>He poured some whiskey into a glass and handed it to him. </span>
<span sid='24818' title='24818'>'That's the physic for the likes of you,' said he. </span>
<span sid='24819' title='24819'>'Now let me hear of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24820' title='24820'>Morris drank, and his white face took a tinge of colour. </span>
<span sid='24821' title='24821'>'I can tell it you all in one sentence,' said he. </span>
<span sid='24822' title='24822'>'There's a detective on our trail.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24823' title='24823'>McMurdo stared at him in astonishment. </span>
<span sid='24824' title='24824'>'Why, man, you're crazy!' he said. </span>
<span sid='24825' title='24825'>'Isn't the place full of police and detectives, and what harm did they ever do us?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24826' title='24826'>'No, no, it's no man of the district. </span>
<span sid='24827' title='24827'>As you say, we know them, and it is little that they can do. </span>
<span sid='24828' title='24828'>But you've heard of Pinkerton's?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24829' title='24829'>'I've read of some folk of that name.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24830' title='24830'>'Well, you can take it from me you've no show when they are on your trail. </span>
<span sid='24831' title='24831'>It's not a take-it-or-miss-it Government concern. </span>
<span sid='24832' title='24832'>It's a dead earnest business proposition that's out for results and keeps out till, by hook or by crook, it gets them. </span>
<span sid='24833' title='24833'>If a Pinkerton man is deep in this business we are all destroyed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24834' title='24834'>'We must kill him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24835' title='24835'>'Ah, it's the first thought that came to you! </span>
<span sid='24836' title='24836'>So it will be up at the Lodge. </span>
<span sid='24837' title='24837'>Didn't I say to you that it would end in murder?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24838' title='24838'>'Sure, what is murder? </span>
<span sid='24839' title='24839'>Isn't it common enough in these parts?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24840' title='24840'>'It is indeed, but it's not for me to point out the man that is to be murdered. </span>
<span sid='24841' title='24841'>I'd never rest easy again. </span>
<span sid='24842' title='24842'>And yet it's our own necks that may be at stake. </span>
<span sid='24843' title='24843'>In God's name what shall I do?' </span>
<span sid='24844' title='24844'>He rocked to and fro in his agony of indecision.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24845' title='24845'>But his words had moved McMurdo deeply. </span>
<span sid='24846' title='24846'>It was easy to see that he shared the other's opinion as to the danger, and the need for meeting it. </span>
<span sid='24847' title='24847'>He gripped Morris's shoulder, and shook him in his earnestness.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24848' title='24848'>'See here, man,' he cried, and he almost screeched the words in his excitement, 'you won't gain anything by sitting keening like an old wife at a wake. </span>
<span sid='24849' title='24849'>Let's have the facts. </span>
<span sid='24850' title='24850'>Who is the fellow? </span>
<span sid='24851' title='24851'>Where is he? </span>
<span sid='24852' title='24852'>How did you hear of him? </span>
<span sid='24853' title='24853'>Why did you come to me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24854' title='24854'>'I came to you, for you are the one man that would advise me. </span>
<span sid='24855' title='24855'>I told you that I had a store in the East before I came here. </span>
<span sid='24856' title='24856'>I left good friends behind me, and one of them is in the telegraph service. </span>
<span sid='24857' title='24857'>Here's a letter that I had from him yesterday. </span>
<span sid='24858' title='24858'>It's this part from the top of the page. </span>
<span sid='24859' title='24859'>You can read it for yourself'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24860' title='24860'>This was what McMurdo read:</span>
<p>
<span sid='24861' title='24861'>How are the Scowrers getting on in your parts? </span>
<span sid='24862' title='24862'>We read plenty of them in the papers. </span>
<span sid='24863' title='24863'>Between you and me I expect to hear news from you before long. </span>
<span sid='24864' title='24864'>Five big corporations and the two railroads have taken the thing up in dead earnest. </span>
<span sid='24865' title='24865'>They mean it, and you can bet they'll get there. </span>
<span sid='24866' title='24866'>They are right deep down into it. </span>
<span sid='24867' title='24867'>Pinkerton has taken hold under their orders, and his best man, Birdy Edwards, is operating. </span>
<span sid='24868' title='24868'>The thing has got to be stopped right now.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24869' title='24869'>'Now read the postscript.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24870' title='24870'>Of course, what I give you is what I learned in business, so it goes no further. </span>
<span sid='24871' title='24871'>It's a queer cipher that you handle by the yard every day and can get no meaning from.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24872' title='24872'>McMurdo sat in silence for some time with the letter in his listless hands. </span>
<span sid='24873' title='24873'>The mist had lifted for a moment, and there was the abyss before him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24874' title='24874'>'Does anyone else know of this?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24875' title='24875'>'I have told no one else.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24876' title='24876'>'But this man - your friend - has he any other person that he would be likely to write to?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24877' title='24877'>'Well, I dare say he knows one or two more.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24878' title='24878'>'Of the Lodge?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24879' title='24879'>'It's likely enough.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24880' title='24880'>'I was asking because it is likely that he may have given some description of this fellow Birdy Edwards - then we could get on his trail.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24881' title='24881'>'Well, it's possible. </span>
<span sid='24882' title='24882'>But I should not think he knew him. </span>
<span sid='24883' title='24883'>He is just telling me the news that came to him by way of business. </span>
<span sid='24884' title='24884'>How would he know this Pinkerton man?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24885' title='24885'>McMurdo gave a violent start.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24886' title='24886'>'By Gar!' he cried, 'I've got him. </span>
<span sid='24887' title='24887'>What a fool I was not to know it! </span>
<span sid='24888' title='24888'>Lord but we're in luck! </span>
<span sid='24889' title='24889'>We will fix him before he can do any harm. </span>
<span sid='24890' title='24890'>See here, Morris, will you leave this thing in my hands?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24891' title='24891'>'Sure, if you will only take it off mine.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24892' title='24892'>'I'll do that. </span>
<span sid='24893' title='24893'>You can stand right back and let me run it. </span>
<span sid='24894' title='24894'>Even your name need not be mentioned. </span>
<span sid='24895' title='24895'>I'll take it all on myself as if it were to me that this letter has come. </span>
<span sid='24896' title='24896'>Will that content you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24897' title='24897'>'It's just what I would ask.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24898' title='24898'>'Then leave it at that and keep your head shut. </span>
<span sid='24899' title='24899'>Now I'll get down to the Lodge, and we'll soon make old man Pinkerton sorry for himself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24900' title='24900'>'You wouldn't kill this man?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24901' title='24901'>'The less you know, Friend Morris, the easier your conscience will be and the better you will sleep. </span>
<span sid='24902' title='24902'>Ask no questions, and let things settle themselves. </span>
<span sid='24903' title='24903'>I have hold of it now.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24904' title='24904'>Morris shook his head sadly as he left. </span>
<span sid='24905' title='24905'>'I feel that his blood is on my hands,' he groaned.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24906' title='24906'>'Self-protection is no murder, anyhow,' said McMurdo, smiling grimly. </span>
<span sid='24907' title='24907'>'It's him or us. </span>
<span sid='24908' title='24908'>I guess this man would destroy us all if we left him long in the valley. </span>
<span sid='24909' title='24909'>Why, Brother Morris, we'll have to elect you Bodymaster yet; for you've surely saved the Lodge.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24910' title='24910'>And yet it was clear from his actions that he thought more seriously of this new intrusion than his words would show. </span>
<span sid='24911' title='24911'>It may have been his guilty conscience; it may have been the reputation of the Pinkerton organization; it may have been the knowledge that great rich corporations had set themselves the task of clearing out the Scowrers; but, whatever his reason, his actions were those of a man who is preparing for the worst. </span>
<span sid='24912' title='24912'>Every paper which could incriminate him was destroyed before he left the house. </span>
<span sid='24913' title='24913'>After that he gave a long sigh of satisfaction; for it seemed to him that he was safe. </span>
<span sid='24914' title='24914'>And yet the danger must still have pressed somewhat upon him, for on his way to the Lodge he stopped at old man Shafter's. </span>
<span sid='24915' title='24915'>The house was forbidden him, but when he tapped at the window Ettie came out to him. </span>
<span sid='24916' title='24916'>The dancing Irish devilry had gone from her lover's eyes. </span>
<span sid='24917' title='24917'>She read his danger in his earnest face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24918' title='24918'>'Something has happened!' she cried. </span>
<span sid='24919' title='24919'>'Oh Jack, you are in danger!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24920' title='24920'>'Sure, it is not very bad, my sweetheart. </span>
<span sid='24921' title='24921'>And yet it may be wise that we make a move before it is worse.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24922' title='24922'>'Make a move?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24923' title='24923'>'I promised you once that I would go some day. </span>
<span sid='24924' title='24924'>I think the time is coming. </span>
<span sid='24925' title='24925'>I had news to-night, bad news, and I see trouble coming.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24926' title='24926'>'The police?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24927' title='24927'>'Well, a Pinkerton. </span>
<span sid='24928' title='24928'>But, sure, you wouldn't know what that is, acushla, nor what it may mean to the likes of me. </span>
<span sid='24929' title='24929'>I'm too deep in this thing, and I may have to get out of it quick. </span>
<span sid='24930' title='24930'>You said you would come with me if I went.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24931' title='24931'>'Oh, Jack, it would be the saving of you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24932' title='24932'>'I'm an honest man in some things, Ettie. </span>
<span sid='24933' title='24933'>I wouldn't hurt a hair of your bonnie head for all that the world can give, nor ever pull you down one inch from the golden throne above the clouds where I always see you. </span>
<span sid='24934' title='24934'>Would you trust me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24935' title='24935'>She put her hand in his without a word.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24936' title='24936'>'Well, then, listen to what I say and do as I order you; for indeed it's the only way for us. </span>
<span sid='24937' title='24937'>Things are going to happen in this valley. </span>
<span sid='24938' title='24938'>I feel it in my bones. </span>
<span sid='24939' title='24939'>There may be many of us that will have to look out for ourselves. </span>
<span sid='24940' title='24940'>I'm one, anyhow. </span>
<span sid='24941' title='24941'>If I go, by day or night, it's you that must come with me!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24942' title='24942'>'I'd come after you, Jack.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24943' title='24943'>'No, no; you shall come with me. </span>
<span sid='24944' title='24944'>If this valley is closed to me and I can never come back, how can I leave you behind, and me perhaps in hiding from the police with never a chance of a message? </span>
<span sid='24945' title='24945'>It's with me you must come. </span>
<span sid='24946' title='24946'>I know a good woman in the place I come from, and it's there I'd leave you till we can get married. </span>
<span sid='24947' title='24947'>Will you come?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24948' title='24948'>'Yes, Jack, I will come.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24949' title='24949'>'God bless you for your trust in me! </span>
<span sid='24950' title='24950'>It's a fiend out of hell that I should be if I abused it. </span>
<span sid='24951' title='24951'>Now, mark you, Ettie, it will be just a word to you, and when it reaches you you will drop everything and come right down to the waiting room at the depot and stay there till I come for you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24952' title='24952'>'Day or night, I'll come at the word, Jack.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24953' title='24953'>Somewhat eased in mind now that his own preparations for escape had been begun, McMurdo went on to the Lodge. </span>
<span sid='24954' title='24954'>It had already assembled, and only by complicated signs and counter signs could he pass through the outer guard and inner guard who close-tiled it. </span>
<span sid='24955' title='24955'>A buzz of pleasure and welcome greeted him as he entered. </span>
<span sid='24956' title='24956'>The long room was crowded, and through the haze of tobacco-smoke he saw the tangled black mane of the Bodymaster, the cruel, unfriendly features of Baldwin, the vulture face of Harraway, the secretary, and a dozen more who were among the leaders of the Lodge. </span>
<span sid='24957' title='24957'>He rejoiced that they should all be there to take counsel over his news.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24958' title='24958'>'Indeed, it's glad we are to see you, Brother!' cried the chairman. </span>
<span sid='24959' title='24959'>'There's business here that wants a Solomon in judgment to set it right.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24960' title='24960'>'It's Lander and Egan,' explained his neighbour, as he took his seat. </span>
<span sid='24961' title='24961'>'They both claim the head-money given by the Lodge for the shooting of old man Crabbe over at Styles- town, and who's to say which fired the bullet?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24962' title='24962'>McMurdo rose in his place and raised his hand. </span>
<span sid='24963' title='24963'>The expression of his face froze the attention of the audience. </span>
<span sid='24964' title='24964'>There was a dead hush of expectation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24965' title='24965'>'Eminent Bodymaster,' he said, in a solemn voice, 'I claim urgency.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24966' title='24966'>'Brother McMurdo claims urgency,' said McGinty. </span>
<span sid='24967' title='24967'>'It's a claim that by the rules of this Lodge takes precedence. </span>
<span sid='24968' title='24968'>Now, Brother, we attend you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24969' title='24969'>McMurdo took the letter from his pocket.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24970' title='24970'>'Eminent Bodymaster and Brethren,' he said, 'I am the bearer of ill news this day, but it is better that it should be known and discussed than that a blow should fall upon us without warning which would destroy us all. </span>
<span sid='24971' title='24971'>I have information that the most powerful and richest organizations in this State have bound themselves together for our destruction, and that at this very moment there is a Pinkerton detective, one Birdy Edwards, at work in the valley collecting the evidence which may put a rope round the neck of many of us, and send every man in this room into a felon's cell. </span>
<span sid='24972' title='24972'>That is the situation for the discussion of which I have made a claim of urgency.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24973' title='24973'>There was a dead silence in the room. </span>
<span sid='24974' title='24974'>It was broken by the chairman.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24975' title='24975'>'What is your evidence for this, Brother McMurdo?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24976' title='24976'>'It is in this letter which has come into my hands,' said McMurdo. </span>
<span sid='24977' title='24977'>He read the passage aloud. </span>
<span sid='24978' title='24978'>It is a matter of honour with me that I can give no further particulars about the letter, nor put it into your hands, but I assure you that there is nothing else in it which can affect the interests of the Lodge. </span>
<span sid='24979' title='24979'>I put the case before you as it has reached me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24980' title='24980'>'Let me say, Mr Chairman,' said one of the older brethren, 'that I have heard of Birdy Edwards, and that he has the name of being the best man in the Pinkerton service:</span>
<p>
<span sid='24981' title='24981'>'Does any one know him by sight?' asked McGinty.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24982' title='24982'>'Yes,' said McMurdo, 'I do.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24983' title='24983'>There was a murmur of astonishment through the hall.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24984' title='24984'>'I believe we hold him in the hollow of our hands,' he continued with an exulting smile upon his face. </span>
<span sid='24985' title='24985'>'If we act quickly and wisely, we can cut this thing short. </span>
<span sid='24986' title='24986'>If I have your confidence and your help, it is little that we have to fear.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24987' title='24987'>'What have we to fear anyhow? </span>
<span sid='24988' title='24988'>What can he know of our affairs?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24989' title='24989'>'You might say so if all were as stanch as you, Councillor. </span>
<span sid='24990' title='24990'>But this man has all the millions of the capitalists at his back. </span>
<span sid='24991' title='24991'>Do you think there is no weaker brother among all our Lodges that could not be bought? </span>
<span sid='24992' title='24992'>He will get at our secrets - maybe has got them already. </span>
<span sid='24993' title='24993'>There's only one sure cure.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24994' title='24994'>'That he never leaves the valley,' said Baldwin.</span>
<p>
<span sid='24995' title='24995'>McMurdo nodded. </span>
<span sid='24996' title='24996'>'Good for you, Brother Baldwin,' he said. </span>
<span sid='24997' title='24997'>'You and I have had our differences, but you have said the true word tonight.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='24998' title='24998'>'Where is he, then? </span>
<span sid='24999' title='24999'>Where shall we know him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25000' title='25000'>'Eminent Bodymaster,' said McMurdo, earnestly, 'I would put it to you that this is too vital a thing for us to discuss in open Lodge. </span>
<span sid='25001' title='25001'>God forbid that I should throw a doubt on anyone here, but if so much as a word of gossip got to the ears of this man, there would be an end of any chance of our getting him. </span>
<span sid='25002' title='25002'>I would ask the Lodge to choose a trusty committee, Mr Chairman - yourself, if I might suggest it, and Brother Baldwin here, and five more. </span>
<span sid='25003' title='25003'>Then I can talk freely of what I know and of what I would advise should be done.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25004' title='25004'>The proposition was at once adopted and the committee chosen. </span>
<span sid='25005' title='25005'>Besides the chairman and Baldwin, there were the vulture-faced secretary, Harraway; Tiger Cormac, the brutal young assassin; Carter, the treasurer; and the brothers Willaby, who were fearless and desperate men who would stick at nothing.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25006' title='25006'>The usual revelry of the Lodge was short and subdued, for there was a cloud upon the men's spirits, and many there for the first time began to see the cloud of avenging Law drifting up in that serene sky under which they had dwelled so long. </span>
<span sid='25007' title='25007'>The horrors which they had dealt out to others had been so much a part of their settled lives that the thought of retribution had become a remote one, and so seemed the more startling now that it came so closely upon them. </span>
<span sid='25008' title='25008'>They broke up early and left their leaders to their council.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25009' title='25009'>'Now, McMurdo,' said McGinty, when they were alone. </span>
<span sid='25010' title='25010'>The seven men sat frozen in their seats.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25011' title='25011'>'I said just now that I knew Birdy Edwards,' McMurdo explained. </span>
<span sid='25012' title='25012'>'I need not tell you that he is not here under that name. </span>
<span sid='25013' title='25013'>He's a brave man, I dare bet, but not a crazy one. </span>
<span sid='25014' title='25014'>He passes under the name of Steve Wilson, and he is lodging at Hobson's Patch.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25015' title='25015'>'How do you know this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25016' title='25016'>'Because I fell into talk with him. </span>
<span sid='25017' title='25017'>I thought little of it at the time, nor would have given it a second thought but for this letter; but now I'm sure it's the man. </span>
<span sid='25018' title='25018'>I met him on the cars when I went down the line on Wednesday - a hard case if ever there was one. </span>
<span sid='25019' title='25019'>He said he was a reporter. </span>
<span sid='25020' title='25020'>I believed it for the moment. </span>
<span sid='25021' title='25021'>Wanted to know all he could get about the Scowrers and what he called "the outrages" for a New <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=York&t=h'>York</a> Paper. </span>
<span sid='25022' title='25022'>Asked me every kind of question so as to get something. </span>
<span sid='25023' title='25023'>You bet I was giving nothing away. </span>
<span sid='25024' title='25024'>"I'd pay for it, and pay well," said he, "if I could get some stuff that would suit my editor." </span>
<span sid='25025' title='25025'>I said what I thought would please him best, and he handed me a twenty-dollar bill for my information. </span>
<span sid='25026' title='25026'>"There's ten times that for you," said he, "if you can find me all that I want."'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25027' title='25027'>'What did you tell him, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25028' title='25028'>'Any stuff I could make up.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25029' title='25029'>'How do you know he wasn't a newspaper man?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25030' title='25030'>'I'll tell you. </span>
<span sid='25031' title='25031'>He got out at Hobson's Patch, and so did I. </span>
<span sid='25032' title='25032'>I chanced into the telegraph bureau, and he was leaving it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25033' title='25033'>'"See here," said the operator, after he'd gone out, "I guess we should charge double rates for this," "I guess you should," said I. </span>
<span sid='25034' title='25034'>He had filled the form with stuff that might have been Chinese for all we could make of it. </span>
<span sid='25035' title='25035'>"He fires a sheet of this off every day," said the clerk. </span>
<span sid='25036' title='25036'>"Yes," said I; "it's special news for his paper, and he's scared that the others should tap it." </span>
<span sid='25037' title='25037'>That was what the operator thought and what I thought at the time; but I think different now.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25038' title='25038'>'By Gar! </span>
<span sid='25039' title='25039'>I believe you are right,' said McGinty. </span>
<span sid='25040' title='25040'>'But what do you allow that we should do about it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25041' title='25041'>'Why not go right down now and fix him?' someone suggested.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25042' title='25042'>'Aye, the sooner the better.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25043' title='25043'>'I'd start this next minute if I knew where we could find him,' said McMurdo. </span>
<span sid='25044' title='25044'>'He's in Hobson's Patch; but I don't know the house. </span>
<span sid='25045' title='25045'>I've got a plan, though, if you'll only take my advice.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25046' title='25046'>'Well, what is it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25047' title='25047'>'I'll go to the Patch tomorrow morning. </span>
<span sid='25048' title='25048'>I'll find him through the operator. </span>
<span sid='25049' title='25049'>He can locate him, I guess. </span>
<span sid='25050' title='25050'>Well, then, I'll tell him that I'm a Freeman myself. </span>
<span sid='25051' title='25051'>I'll offer him all the secrets of the Lodge for a price. </span>
<span sid='25052' title='25052'>You bet he'll tumble to it. </span>
<span sid='25053' title='25053'>I'll tell him the papers are at my house, and that it's as much as my life would be worth to let him come while folk were about. </span>
<span sid='25054' title='25054'>He'll see that that's horse sense. </span>
<span sid='25055' title='25055'>Let him come at ten o'clock at night, and he shall see everything. </span>
<span sid='25056' title='25056'>That will fetch him, sure.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25057' title='25057'>'Well?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25058' title='25058'>'You can plan the rest for yourselves. </span>
<span sid='25059' title='25059'>Widow MacNamara's is a lonely house. </span>
<span sid='25060' title='25060'>She's as true as steel and as deaf as a post. </span>
<span sid='25061' title='25061'>There's only Scanlan and me in the house. </span>
<span sid='25062' title='25062'>If I get his promise - and I'll let you know if I do	I'd have the whole seven of you come to me by nine o'clock. </span>
<span sid='25063' title='25063'>We'll get him in. </span>
<span sid='25064' title='25064'>If ever he gets out alive - well, he can talk of Birdy Edward's luck for the rest of his days.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25065' title='25065'>'There's going to be a vacancy at Pinkerton's or I'm mistaken,' said McGinty. </span>
<span sid='25066' title='25066'>'Leave it at that, McMurdo. </span>
<span sid='25067' title='25067'>At nine tomorrow we shall be with you. </span>
<span sid='25068' title='25068'>You once get the door shut behind him, and you can leave the rest with us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25069' title='25069'>CHAPTER 7 : The Trapping of Birdy Edwards</span>
<p>
<span sid='25070' title='25070'>As McMurdo had said, the house in which he lived was a lonely one and very well suited for such a crime as they had planned. </span>
<span sid='25071' title='25071'>It was on the extreme fringe of the town, and stood well back from the road. </span>
<span sid='25072' title='25072'>In any other case the conspirators would have simply called out their man, as they had many a time before, and emptied their pistols into his body; but in this instance it was very necessary to find out how much he knew, how he knew it, and what had been passed on to his employers.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25073' title='25073'>It was possible that they were already too late and that the work had been done. </span>
<span sid='25074' title='25074'>If that were indeed so, they could at least have their revenge upon the man who had done it. </span>
<span sid='25075' title='25075'>But they were hopeful that nothing of great importance had yet come to the detective's knowledge, as otherwise, they argued, he would not have troubled to write down and forward such trivial information as McMurdo claimed to have given him. </span>
<span sid='25076' title='25076'>However, all this they would learn from his own lips. </span>
<span sid='25077' title='25077'>Once in their power they would find a way to make him speak. </span>
<span sid='25078' title='25078'>It was not the first time they had handled an unwilling witness.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25079' title='25079'>McMurdo went to Hobson's Patch as agreed. </span>
<span sid='25080' title='25080'>The police seemed to take a particular interest in him that morning, and Captain Marvin - he who had claimed the old acquaintance with him at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a> - actually addressed him as he waited at the station. </span>
<span sid='25081' title='25081'>McMurdo turned away and refused to speak with him. </span>
<span sid='25082' title='25082'>He was back from his mission in the afternoon, and saw McGinty at the Union House.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25083' title='25083'>'He is coming,' he said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25084' title='25084'>'Good!' said McGinty. </span>
<span sid='25085' title='25085'>The giant was in his shirtsleeves, with chains and seals gleaming athwart his ample waistcoat and a diamond twinkling through the fringe of his bristling beard. </span>
<span sid='25086' title='25086'>Drink and politics had made the Boss a very rich as well as powerful man. </span>
<span sid='25087' title='25087'>The more terrible, therefore, seemed that glimpse of the prison or the gallows which had risen before him the night before.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25088' title='25088'>'Do you reckon he knows much?' he asked anxiously.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25089' title='25089'>McMurdo shook his head gloomily. </span>
<span sid='25090' title='25090'>'He's been here some time - six weeks at the least. </span>
<span sid='25091' title='25091'>I guess he didn't come into these parts to look at the prospect. </span>
<span sid='25092' title='25092'>If he has been working among us all that time with the railroad money at his back, I should expect that he has got results, and that he has passed them on.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25093' title='25093'>'There's not a weak man in the Lodge,' cried McGinty. </span>
<span sid='25094' title='25094'>'True as steel, every man of them. </span>
<span sid='25095' title='25095'>And yet, by the Lord! there is that skunk Morris. </span>
<span sid='25096' title='25096'>What about him? </span>
<span sid='25097' title='25097'>If any man gives us away it would be he. </span>
<span sid='25098' title='25098'>I've a mind to send a couple of the boys round before evening to give him a beating up and see what they can get from him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25099' title='25099'>'Well, there would be no harm in that,' McMurdo answered. </span>
<span sid='25100' title='25100'>'I won't deny that I have a liking for Morris and would be sorry to see him come to harm. </span>
<span sid='25101' title='25101'>He has spoken to me once or twice over Lodge matters, and though he may not see them the same as you or I, he never seemed the sort that squeals. </span>
<span sid='25102' title='25102'>But still, it is not for me to stand between him and you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25103' title='25103'>'I'll fix the old devil,' said McGinty with an oath. </span>
<span sid='25104' title='25104'>'I've had my eye on him this year past.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25105' title='25105'>'Well, you know best about that,' McMurdo answered. </span>
<span sid='25106' title='25106'>'But whatever you do must be to-morrow, for we must lie low until the Pinkerton affair is settled up. </span>
<span sid='25107' title='25107'>We can't afford to set the police buzzing to-day of all days.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25108' title='25108'>'True for you,' said McGinty. </span>
<span sid='25109' title='25109'>'And we'll learn from Birdy Edwards himself where he got his news, if we have to cut his heart out first. </span>
<span sid='25110' title='25110'>Did he seem to scent a trap?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25111' title='25111'>McMurdo laughed. </span>
<span sid='25112' title='25112'>'I guess I took him on his weak point,' he said. </span>
<span sid='25113' title='25113'>'If he could get on a good trail of the Scowrers, he's ready to follow it into hell. </span>
<span sid='25114' title='25114'>I took his money' - McMurdo grinned as he produced a wad of dollar notes - 'and as much more when he has seen all my papers.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25115' title='25115'>'What papers?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25116' title='25116'>'Well, there are no papers. </span>
<span sid='25117' title='25117'>But I filled him up about constitutions and books of rules and forms of membership. </span>
<span sid='25118' title='25118'>He expects to get right down to the end of everything before he leaves.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25119' title='25119'>'Faith, he's right there,' said McGinty grimly. </span>
<span sid='25120' title='25120'>'Didn't he ask you why you didn't bring him the papers?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25121' title='25121'>'As if I would carry such things, and me a suspected man, and Captain Marvin after speaking to me this very day at the depot!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25122' title='25122'>'Aye, I heard of that,' said McGinty. </span>
<span sid='25123' title='25123'>'I guess the heavy end of this business is coming on to you. </span>
<span sid='25124' title='25124'>We could put him down an old shaft when we've done with him; but however we work it we can't get past the man living at Hobson's Patch and you being there to-day.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25125' title='25125'>McMurdo shrugged his shoulders. </span>
<span sid='25126' title='25126'>'If we handle it right, they can never prove the killing,' said he. </span>
<span sid='25127' title='25127'>'No one can see him come to the house after dark, and I'll lay to it that no one will see him go. </span>
<span sid='25128' title='25128'>Now, see here, Councillor, I'll show you my plan, and I'll ask you to fit the others into it. </span>
<span sid='25129' title='25129'>You will all come in good time. </span>
<span sid='25130' title='25130'>Very well. </span>
<span sid='25131' title='25131'>He comes at ten. </span>
<span sid='25132' title='25132'>He is to tap three times, and me to open the door for him. </span>
<span sid='25133' title='25133'>Then get behind him and shut it. </span>
<span sid='25134' title='25134'>He's our man then.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25135' title='25135'>'That's all easy and plain.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25136' title='25136'>'Yes; but the next step wants considering. </span>
<span sid='25137' title='25137'>He's a hard proposition. </span>
<span sid='25138' title='25138'>He's heavily armed. </span>
<span sid='25139' title='25139'>I've fooled him proper, and yet he is likely to be on his guard. </span>
<span sid='25140' title='25140'>Suppose I show him right into a room with seven men in it where he expected to find me alone. </span>
<span sid='25141' title='25141'>There is going to be shooting and somebody is going to be hurt.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25142' title='25142'>'That's so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25143' title='25143'>'And the noise is going to bring every damned copper in the township on top of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25144' title='25144'>'I guess you are right.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25145' title='25145'>'This is how I should work it. </span>
<span sid='25146' title='25146'>You will all be in the big room - same as you saw when you had a chat with me. </span>
<span sid='25147' title='25147'>I'll open the door for him, show him into the parlour beside the door, and leave him there while I get the papers. </span>
<span sid='25148' title='25148'>That will give me the chance of telling you how things are shaping. </span>
<span sid='25149' title='25149'>Then I will go back to him with some faked papers. </span>
<span sid='25150' title='25150'>As he is reading them I will jump for him and get my grip on his pistol arm. </span>
<span sid='25151' title='25151'>You'll hear me call and in you will rush. </span>
<span sid='25152' title='25152'>The quicker the better; for he is as strong a man as I, and I may have more than I can manage. </span>
<span sid='25153' title='25153'>But I allow that I can hold him till you come.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25154' title='25154'>'It's a good plan,' said McGinty. </span>
<span sid='25155' title='25155'>'The Lodge will owe you a debt for this. </span>
<span sid='25156' title='25156'>I guess when I move out of the chair I can put a name to the man that's coming after me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25157' title='25157'>'Sure, Councillor, I am little more than a recruit,' said McMurdo, but his face showed what he thought of the great man's compliment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25158' title='25158'>When he had returned home he made his own preparations for the grim evening in front of him. </span>
<span sid='25159' title='25159'>First he cleaned, oiled, and loaded his Smith & Wesson revolver. </span>
<span sid='25160' title='25160'>Then he surveyed the room in which the detective was to be trapped. </span>
<span sid='25161' title='25161'>It was a large apartment, with a long deal table in the centre, and the big stove at one side. </span>
<span sid='25162' title='25162'>At each of the other sides were windows. </span>
<span sid='25163' title='25163'>There were no shutters to these: only light curtains which drew across. </span>
<span sid='25164' title='25164'>McMurdo examined these attentively. </span>
<span sid='25165' title='25165'>No doubt it must have struck him that the apartment was very exposed for so secret a meeting. </span>
<span sid='25166' title='25166'>Yet its distance from the road made it of less consequence. </span>
<span sid='25167' title='25167'>Finally he discussed the matter with his fellow-lodger. </span>
<span sid='25168' title='25168'>Scanlan, though a Scowrer, was an inoffensive little man who was too weak to stand against the opinion of his comrades, but was secretly horrified by the deeds of blood at which he had sometimes been forced to assist. </span>
<span sid='25169' title='25169'>McMurdo told him shortly what was intended.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25170' title='25170'>'And if I were you, Mike Scanlan, I would take a night off and keep clear of it. </span>
<span sid='25171' title='25171'>There will be bloody work here before morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25172' title='25172'>'Well, indeed, then, Mac,' Scanlan answered, 'it's not the will but the nerve that is wanting in me. </span>
<span sid='25173' title='25173'>When I saw Manager Dunn go down at the colliery yonder it was just more than I could stand. </span>
<span sid='25174' title='25174'>I'm not made for it, same as you or McGinty. </span>
<span sid='25175' title='25175'>If the Lodge will think none the worse of me, I'll just do as you advise, and leave you to yourselves for the evening.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25176' title='25176'>The men came in good time as arranged. </span>
<span sid='25177' title='25177'>They were outwardly respectable citizens, well-clad and cleanly; but a judge of faces would have read little hope for Birdy Edwards in those hard mouths and remorseless eyes. </span>
<span sid='25178' title='25178'>There was not a man in the room whose hands had not been reddened a dozen times before. </span>
<span sid='25179' title='25179'>They were as hardened to human murder as a butcher to sheep.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25180' title='25180'>Foremost, of course, both in appearance and in guilt, was the formidable Boss. </span>
<span sid='25181' title='25181'>Harraway, the secretary, was a lean, bitter man, with a long, scraggy neck and nervous, jerky limbs - a man of incorruptible fidelity where the finances of the Order were concerned, and with no notion of justice or honesty to anyone beyond. </span>
<span sid='25182' title='25182'>The treasurer, Carter, was a middle-aged man with an impassive, rather sulky expression and a yellow parchment skin. </span>
<span sid='25183' title='25183'>He was a capable organizer, and the actual details of nearly every outrage had sprung from his plotting brain. </span>
<span sid='25184' title='25184'>The two Willabys were men of action, tall, lithe young fellows with determined faces, while their companion, Tiger Cormac, a heavy, dark youth, was feared even by his own comrades for the ferocity of his disposition. </span>
<span sid='25185' title='25185'>These were the men who assembled that night under the roof of McMurdo for the killing of the Pinkerton detective.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25186' title='25186'>Their host had placed whiskey upon the table, and they had hastened to prime themselves for the work before them. </span>
<span sid='25187' title='25187'>Baldwin and Cormac were already half drunk, and the liquor had brought out all their ferocity. </span>
<span sid='25188' title='25188'>Cormac placed his hands on the stove for an instant - it had been lighted, for the nights were still cold.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25189' title='25189'>'That will do,' said he, with an oath.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25190' title='25190'>'Aye,' said Baldwin, catching his meaning. </span>
<span sid='25191' title='25191'>'If he is strapped to that we will have the truth out of him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25192' title='25192'>'We'll have the truth out of him, never fear,' said McMurdo. </span>
<span sid='25193' title='25193'>He had nerves of steel, this man, for, though the whole weight of the affair was on him, his manner was as cool and unconcerned as ever. </span>
<span sid='25194' title='25194'>The others marked it and applauded.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25195' title='25195'>'You are the one to handle him,' said the Boss, approvingly. </span>
<span sid='25196' title='25196'>'Not a warning will he get till your hand is on his throat. </span>
<span sid='25197' title='25197'>It's a pity there are no shutters to your windows.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25198' title='25198'>McMurdo went from one to the other and drew the curtain tighter. </span>
<span sid='25199' title='25199'>'Sure, no one can spy upon us now. </span>
<span sid='25200' title='25200'>It's close upon the hour.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25201' title='25201'>'Maybe he won't come. </span>
<span sid='25202' title='25202'>Maybe he'll get a sniff of danger,' said the secretary.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25203' title='25203'>'He'll come, never fear,' McMurdo answered. </span>
<span sid='25204' title='25204'>'He is as eager to come as you can be to see him. </span>
<span sid='25205' title='25205'>Hark to that!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25206' title='25206'>They all sat like wax figures, some with their glasses arrested halfway to their lips. </span>
<span sid='25207' title='25207'>Three loud knocks had sounded at the door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25208' title='25208'>'Hush!' </span>
<span sid='25209' title='25209'>McMurdo raised his hand in caution. </span>
<span sid='25210' title='25210'>An exulting glance went round the circle and hands were laid upon hidden weapons.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25211' title='25211'>'Not a sound, for your lives!' </span>
<span sid='25212' title='25212'>McMurdo whispered, as he went from the room, closing the door carefully behind him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25213' title='25213'>With strained ears the murderers waited. </span>
<span sid='25214' title='25214'>They counted the steps of their comrade down the passage. </span>
<span sid='25215' title='25215'>Then they heard him open the outer door. </span>
<span sid='25216' title='25216'>There were a few words as of greeting. </span>
<span sid='25217' title='25217'>Then they were aware of a strange step inside and of an unfamiliar voice. </span>
<span sid='25218' title='25218'>An instant later came the slam of the door and the turning of the key in the lock. </span>
<span sid='25219' title='25219'>Their prey was safe within the trap. </span>
<span sid='25220' title='25220'>Tiger Cormac laughed horribly, and Boss McGinty clapped his great hand across his mouth.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25221' title='25221'>'Be quiet, you fool!' he whispered. </span>
<span sid='25222' title='25222'>'You'll be the undoing of us yet!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25223' title='25223'>There was a mutter of conversation from the next room. </span>
<span sid='25224' title='25224'>It seemed interminable. </span>
<span sid='25225' title='25225'>Then the door opened, and McMurdo appeared, his finger upon his lip.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25226' title='25226'>He came to the end of the table and looked round at them, A subtle change had come over him. </span>
<span sid='25227' title='25227'>His manner was as of one who has great work to do. </span>
<span sid='25228' title='25228'>His face had set into granite firmness. </span>
<span sid='25229' title='25229'>His eyes shone with a fierce excitement behind his spectacles. </span>
<span sid='25230' title='25230'>He had become a visible leader of men. </span>
<span sid='25231' title='25231'>They stared at him with eager interest; but he said nothing. </span>
<span sid='25232' title='25232'>Still with the same singular gaze, he looked from man to man.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25233' title='25233'>'Well,' cried Boss McGinty at last, 'is he here? </span>
<span sid='25234' title='25234'>Is Birdy Edwards here?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25235' title='25235'>'Yes,' McMurdo answered slowly. </span>
<span sid='25236' title='25236'>'Birdy Edwards is here. </span>
<span sid='25237' title='25237'>I am Birdy Edwards!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25238' title='25238'>There were ten seconds after that brief speech during which the room might have been empty, so profound was the silence. </span>
<span sid='25239' title='25239'>The hissing of a kettle upon the stove rose sharp and strident to the ear. </span>
<span sid='25240' title='25240'>Seven white faces, all turned upwards to this man who dominated them, were set motionless with utter terror. </span>
<span sid='25241' title='25241'>Then, with a sudden shivering of glass, a bristle of glistening rifle-barrels broke through each window, while the curtains were torn from their hangings.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25242' title='25242'>At the sight Boss McGinty gave the roar of a wounded bear and plunged for the half-opened door. </span>
<span sid='25243' title='25243'>A levelled revolver met him there, with the stern blue eyes of Captain Marvin of the Coal and Iron Police gleaming behind the sights. </span>
<span sid='25244' title='25244'>The Boss recoiled and fell back into his chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25245' title='25245'>'You're safer there, Councillor,' said the man whom they had known as McMurdo. </span>
<span sid='25246' title='25246'>'And you, Baldwin, if you don't take your hand off your gun you'll cheat the hangman yet. </span>
<span sid='25247' title='25247'>Pull it out, or, by the Lord that made me - There, that will do. </span>
<span sid='25248' title='25248'>There are forty armed men round this house, and you can figure it out for yourselves what chance you have. </span>
<span sid='25249' title='25249'>Take their pistols, Marvin!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25250' title='25250'>There was no possible resistance under the menace of those rifles. </span>
<span sid='25251' title='25251'>The men were disarmed. </span>
<span sid='25252' title='25252'>Sulky, sheepish, and amazed, they still sat round the table.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25253' title='25253'>'I'd like to say a word to you before we separate,' said the man who had trapped them. </span>
<span sid='25254' title='25254'>'I guess we may not meet again until you see me on the stand in the court-house. </span>
<span sid='25255' title='25255'>I'll give you something to think over between now and then. </span>
<span sid='25256' title='25256'>You know me now for what I am. </span>
<span sid='25257' title='25257'>At last I can put my cards on the table. </span>
<span sid='25258' title='25258'>I am Birdy Edwards of Pinkerton's. </span>
<span sid='25259' title='25259'>I was chosen to break up your gang. </span>
<span sid='25260' title='25260'>I had a hard and a dangerous game to play. </span>
<span sid='25261' title='25261'>Not a soul, not one soul, not my nearest and dearest, knew that I was playing it. </span>
<span sid='25262' title='25262'>Only Captain Marvin here and my employers knew that. </span>
<span sid='25263' title='25263'>But it's over to-night, thank God, and I am the winner!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25264' title='25264'>The seven pale, rigid faces looked up at him. </span>
<span sid='25265' title='25265'>There was an unappeasable hatred in their eyes. </span>
<span sid='25266' title='25266'>He read the relentless threat.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25267' title='25267'>'Maybe you think that the game is not over yet. </span>
<span sid='25268' title='25268'>Well, I take my chance on that. </span>
<span sid='25269' title='25269'>Anyhow, some of you will take no further hand, and there are sixty more besides yourselves that will see a jail this night. </span>
<span sid='25270' title='25270'>I'll tell you this, that when I was put upon this job I never believed there was such a society as yours. </span>
<span sid='25271' title='25271'>I thought it was paper talk, and that I would prove it so. </span>
<span sid='25272' title='25272'>They told me it was to do with the Freemen, so I went to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a> and was made one. </span>
<span sid='25273' title='25273'>Then I was surer than ever that it was just paper talk; for I found no harm in the society, but a deal of good.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25274' title='25274'>'Still, I had to carry out my job, and I came to the coal valleys. </span>
<span sid='25275' title='25275'>When I reached this place I learned that I was wrong and that it wasn't a dime novel after all. </span>
<span sid='25276' title='25276'>So I stayed to look after it. </span>
<span sid='25277' title='25277'>I never killed a man in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>. </span>
<span sid='25278' title='25278'>I never minted a dollar in my life. </span>
<span sid='25279' title='25279'>Those I gave you were as good as any others; but I never spent money better. </span>
<span sid='25280' title='25280'>But I knew the way into your good wishes, and so I pretended to you that the law was after me. </span>
<span sid='25281' title='25281'>It all worked just as I thought.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25282' title='25282'>'So I joined your infernal Lodge and I took my share in your councils. </span>
<span sid='25283' title='25283'>Maybe they will say that I was as bad as you. </span>
<span sid='25284' title='25284'>They can say what they like, so long as I get you. </span>
<span sid='25285' title='25285'>But what is the truth? </span>
<span sid='25286' title='25286'>The night I joined, you beat up old man Stanger. </span>
<span sid='25287' title='25287'>I could not warn him, for there was no time; but I held your hand, Baldwin, when you would have killed him. </span>
<span sid='25288' title='25288'>If ever I have suggested things, so as to keep my place among you, they were things which I knew I could prevent. </span>
<span sid='25289' title='25289'>I could not save Dunn and Menzies, for I did not know enough; but I will see that their murderers are hanged. </span>
<span sid='25290' title='25290'>I gave Chester Wilcox warning, so that when I blew his house in he and his folk were in hiding. </span>
<span sid='25291' title='25291'>There was many a crime that I could not stop, but if you look back and think how often your man came home the other road, or was down in town when you went for him, or stayed indoors when you thought that he would come out, you'll see my work.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25292' title='25292'>'You blasted traitor!' hissed McGinty, through his closed teeth.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25293' title='25293'>'Aye, John McGinty, you may call me that if it eases your smart. </span>
<span sid='25294' title='25294'>You and your like have been the enemy of God and man in these parts. </span>
<span sid='25295' title='25295'>It took a man to get between you and the poor devils of men and women that you held under your grip. </span>
<span sid='25296' title='25296'>There was just one way of doing it, and I did it. </span>
<span sid='25297' title='25297'>You call me a "traitor", but I guess there's many a thousand will call me a "deliverer" that went down into hell to save them. </span>
<span sid='25298' title='25298'>I've had three months of it. </span>
<span sid='25299' title='25299'>I wouldn't have three such months again if they let me loose in the Treasury at Washington for it. </span>
<span sid='25300' title='25300'>I had to stay till I had it all, every man and every secret, right here in this hand. </span>
<span sid='25301' title='25301'>I'd have waited a little longer if it hadn't come to my knowledge that my secret was coming out. </span>
<span sid='25302' title='25302'>A letter had come into the town that would have set you wise to it all. </span>
<span sid='25303' title='25303'>Then I had to act, and act quickly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25304' title='25304'>'I've nothing more to say to you, except that when my time comes I'll die the easier when I think of the work I have done in this valley. </span>
<span sid='25305' title='25305'>Now, Marvin, I'll keep you no more. </span>
<span sid='25306' title='25306'>Take them in and get it over.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25307' title='25307'>There is little more to tell. </span>
<span sid='25308' title='25308'>Scanlan had been given a sealed note to be left at the address of Miss Ettie Shafter - a mission which he had accepted with a wink and a knowing smile. </span>
<span sid='25309' title='25309'>In the early hours of the morning a beautiful woman and a much-muffled man boarded a special train which had been sent by the railroad company, and made a swift, unbroken journey out of the land of danger. </span>
<span sid='25310' title='25310'>It was the last time that ever either Ettie or her lover set foot in the Valley of Fear. </span>
<span sid='25311' title='25311'>Ten days later they were married in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>, with old Jacob Shafter as witness of the wedding.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25312' title='25312'>The trial of the Scowrers was held far from the place where their adherents might have terrified the guardians of the law. </span>
<span sid='25313' title='25313'>In vain they struggled. </span>
<span sid='25314' title='25314'>In vain the money of the lodge - money squeezed by blackmail out of the whole countryside - was spent like water in the attempt to save them. </span>
<span sid='25315' title='25315'>That cold, clear, unimpassioned statement from one who knew every detail of their lives, their organization, and their crimes was unshaken by all the wiles of their defenders. </span>
<span sid='25316' title='25316'>At last, after so many years, they were broken and scattered. </span>
<span sid='25317' title='25317'>The cloud was lifted for ever from the valley. </span>
<span sid='25318' title='25318'>McGinty met his fate upon the scaffold, cringing and whining when the last hour came. </span>
<span sid='25319' title='25319'>Eight of his chief followers shared his fate. </span>
<span sid='25320' title='25320'>Fifty-odd had various degrees of imprisonment. </span>
<span sid='25321' title='25321'>The work of Birdy Edwards was complete.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25322' title='25322'>And yet, as he had guessed, the game was not over yet. </span>
<span sid='25323' title='25323'>There was another hand to be played, and yet another and another. </span>
<span sid='25324' title='25324'>Ted Baldwin, for one, had escaped the scaffold; so had the Willabys; so had several other of the fiercest spirits of the gang. </span>
<span sid='25325' title='25325'>For ten years they were out of the world, and then came a day when they were free once more	a day which Edwards, who knew his men, was very sure would be an end of his life of peace. </span>
<span sid='25326' title='25326'>They had sworn an oath on all that they thought holy to have his blood as a vengeance for their comrades. </span>
<span sid='25327' title='25327'>And well they strove to keep their vow!</span>
<p>
<span sid='25328' title='25328'>From <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a> he was chased, after two attempts so near to success that it was sure that the third would get him. </span>
<span sid='25329' title='25329'>From <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a> he went under a changed name to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=California&t=h'>California</a>, and it was there that the light went for a time out of his life when Ettie Edwards died. </span>
<span sid='25330' title='25330'>Once again he was nearly killed, and once again under the name of Douglas he worked in a lonely canyon, where, with an English partner named Barker, he amassed a fortune. </span>
<span sid='25331' title='25331'>At last there came a warning to him that the bloodhounds were on his track once more, and he cleared - only just in time - for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>. </span>
<span sid='25332' title='25332'>And thence came the John Douglas who for a second time married a worthy mate and lived for five years as a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sussex&t=h'>Sussex</a> country gentleman - a life which ended with the strange happenings of which we have heard.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25333' title='25333'>Epilogue</span>
<p>
<span sid='25334' title='25334'>The police-court proceedings had passed, in which the case of John Douglas was referred to a higher court. </span>
<span sid='25335' title='25335'>So had the Assizes, at which he was acquitted as having acted in self-defence.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25336' title='25336'>'Get him out of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> at any cost,' wrote Holmes to the wife. </span>
<span sid='25337' title='25337'>'There are forces here which may be more dangerous than those he has escaped. </span>
<span sid='25338' title='25338'>There is no safety for your husband in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25339' title='25339'>Two months had gone by, and the case had to some extent passed from our minds. </span>
<span sid='25340' title='25340'>Then one morning there came an enigmatic note slipped into our letter-box. </span>
<span sid='25341' title='25341'>'Dear me, Mr Holmes! </span>
<span sid='25342' title='25342'>Dear me!' said this singular epistle. </span>
<span sid='25343' title='25343'>There was neither superscription nor signature. </span>
<span sid='25344' title='25344'>I laughed at the quaint message, but Holmes showed an unwonted seriousness.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25345' title='25345'>'Devilry, Watson!' he remarked, and sat long with a clouded brow.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25346' title='25346'>Late that night Mrs Hudson, our landlady, brought up a message that a gentleman wished to see Holmes, and that the matter was of the utmost importance. </span>
<span sid='25347' title='25347'>Close at the heels of his messenger came Mr Cecil Barker, our friend of the moated Manor House. </span>
<span sid='25348' title='25348'>His face was drawn and haggard.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25349' title='25349'>'I've had bad news - terrible news, Mr Holmes,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25350' title='25350'>'I feared as much,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25351' title='25351'>'You have not had a cable, have you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25352' title='25352'>'I have had a note from someone who has.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25353' title='25353'>'It's poor Douglas. </span>
<span sid='25354' title='25354'>They tell me his name is Edwards, but he will always be Jack Douglas of Benito Canyon to me. </span>
<span sid='25355' title='25355'>I told you that they started together for South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a> in the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Palmyra&t=h'>Palmyra</a> three weeks ago.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25356' title='25356'>'Exactly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25357' title='25357'>'The ship reached <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Cape Town&t=h'>Cape Town</a> last night. </span>
<span sid='25358' title='25358'>I received this cable from Mrs Douglas this morning:</span>
<p>
<span sid='25359' title='25359'>'Jack has been lost overboard in gale off St Helena. </span>
<span sid='25360' title='25360'>No one knows how accident occurred - Ivy Douglas."'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25361' title='25361'>'Ha! </span>
<span sid='25362' title='25362'>It came like that, did it?' said Holmes, thoughtfully. </span>
<span sid='25363' title='25363'>'Well, I've no doubt it was well stage-managed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25364' title='25364'>'You mean that you think there was no accident?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25365' title='25365'>'None in the world.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25366' title='25366'>'He was murdered?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25367' title='25367'>'Surely!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25368' title='25368'>'So I think also. </span>
<span sid='25369' title='25369'>These infernal Scowrers, this cursed vindictive nest of criminals-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25370' title='25370'>'No, no, my good sir,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='25371' title='25371'>'There is a master hand here. </span>
<span sid='25372' title='25372'>It is no case of sawed-off shot-guns and clumsy six-shooters. </span>
<span sid='25373' title='25373'>You can tell an old master by the sweep of his brush. </span>
<span sid='25374' title='25374'>I can tell a Moriarty when I see one. </span>
<span sid='25375' title='25375'>This crime is from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, not from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25376' title='25376'>'But for what motive?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25377' title='25377'>'Because it is done by a man who cannot afford to fail - one whose whole unique position depends upon the fact that all he does must succeed. </span>
<span sid='25378' title='25378'>A great brain and a huge organization have been turned to the extinction of one man. </span>
<span sid='25379' title='25379'>It is crushing the nut with the hammer - an absurd extravagance of energy - but the nut is very effectually crushed all the same.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25380' title='25380'>'How came this man to have anything to do with it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25381' title='25381'>'I can only say that the first word that ever came to us of the business was from one of his lieutenants. </span>
<span sid='25382' title='25382'>These <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>ns were well advised. </span>
<span sid='25383' title='25383'>Having an English job to do, they took into partnership, as any foreign criminal could do, this great consultant in crime. </span>
<span sid='25384' title='25384'>From that moment their man was doomed. </span>
<span sid='25385' title='25385'>At first he would content himself by using his machinery in order to find their victim. </span>
<span sid='25386' title='25386'>Then he would indicate how the matter might be treated. </span>
<span sid='25387' title='25387'>Finally, when he read in the reports of the failure of this agent, he would step in himself with a master touch. </span>
<span sid='25388' title='25388'>You heard me warn this man at Birlstone Manor House that the coming danger was greater than the past. </span>
<span sid='25389' title='25389'>Was I right?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25390' title='25390'>Barker beat his head with his clenched fist in his impotent anger.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25391' title='25391'>'Do you tell me that we have to sit down under this? </span>
<span sid='25392' title='25392'>Do you say that no one can ever get level with this king-devil?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25393' title='25393'>'No, I don't say that,' said Holmes, and his eyes seemed to be looking far into the future. </span>
<span sid='25394' title='25394'>'I don't say that he can't be beat. </span>
<span sid='25395' title='25395'>But you must give me time - you must give me time!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25396' title='25396'>We all sat in silence for some minutes, while those fateful eyes still strained to pierce the veil.</span>
