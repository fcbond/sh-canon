<p class="subtitle">Arthur Conan Doyle<label for="sn-meta-prio" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-meta-prio" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><!--googleoff: all--><b>Story Number</b>: 32<br><b>Published in</b>: Collier's on 30 January 1904 (US)<br><b>Collected in</b>: The Return of Sherlock Holmes<!--googleon: all--></span></p>
<p>
<span sid='17064' title='17064'>We have had some dramatic entrances and exits upon our small stage at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>, but I cannot recollect anything more sudden and startling than the first appearance of Dr Thorneycroft Huxtable, M.A., Ph.D., etc. </span>
<span sid='17065' title='17065'>His card, which seemed too small to carry the weight of his academic distinctions, preceded him by a few seconds, and then he entered himself - so large, so pompous, and so dignified that he was the very embodiment of self-possession and solidity. </span>
<span sid='17066' title='17066'>And yet his first action when the door had closed behind him was to stagger against the table, whence he slipped down upon the floor, and there was that majestic figure prostrate and insensible upon our bearskin hearthrug.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17067' title='17067'>We had sprung to our feet, and for a few moments we stared in silent amazement at this ponderous piece of wreckage, which told of some sudden and fatal storm far out on the ocean of life. </span>
<span sid='17068' title='17068'>Then Holmes hurried with a cushion for his head, and I with brandy for his lips. </span>
<span sid='17069' title='17069'>The heavy white face was seamed with lines of trouble, the hanging pouches under the closed eyes were leaden in colour, the loose mouth drooped dolorously at the corners, the rolling chins were unshaven. </span>
<span sid='17070' title='17070'>Collar and shirt bore the grime of a long journey, and the hair bristled unkempt from the well-shaped head. </span>
<span sid='17071' title='17071'>It was a sorely stricken man who lay before us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17072' title='17072'>'What is it, Watson?' asked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17073' title='17073'>'Absolute exhaustion - possibly mere hunger and fatigue,' said I, with my finger on the thready pulse, where the stream of life trickled thin and small.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17074' title='17074'>'Return ticket from Mackleton, in the North of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>,' said Holmes, drawing it from the watch-pocket. </span>
<span sid='17075' title='17075'>'It is not twelve o'clock yet. </span>
<span sid='17076' title='17076'>He has certainly been an early starter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17077' title='17077'>The puckered eyelids had begun to quiver, and now a pair of vacant, grey eyes looked up at us. </span>
<span sid='17078' title='17078'>An instant later the man had scrambled on to his feet, his face crimson with shame.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17079' title='17079'>'Forgive this weakness, Mr Holmes; I have been a little overwrought. </span>
<span sid='17080' title='17080'>Thank you, if I might have a glass of milk and a biscuit I have no doubt that I should be better. </span>
<span sid='17081' title='17081'>I came personally, Mr Holmes, in order to ensure that you would return with me. </span>
<span sid='17082' title='17082'>I feared that no telegram would convince you of the absolute urgency of the case.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17083' title='17083'>'When you are quite restored-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17084' title='17084'>'I am quite well again. </span>
<span sid='17085' title='17085'>I cannot imagine how I came to be so weak. </span>
<span sid='17086' title='17086'>I wish you, Mr Holmes, to come to Mackleton with me by the next train.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17087' title='17087'>My friend shook his head.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17088' title='17088'>'My colleague, Dr Watson, could tell you that we are very busy at present. </span>
<span sid='17089' title='17089'>I am retained in this case of the Ferrers Documents, and the Abergavenny murder is coming up for trial. </span>
<span sid='17090' title='17090'>Only a very important issue could call me from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> at present.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17091' title='17091'>'Important!' </span>
<span sid='17092' title='17092'>Our visitor threw up his hands. </span>
<span sid='17093' title='17093'>'Have you heard nothing of the abduction of the only son of the Duke of Holdernesse?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17094' title='17094'>'What! the late Cabinet Minister?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17095' title='17095'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='17096' title='17096'>We had tried to keep it out of the papers, but there was some rumour in the Globe last night. </span>
<span sid='17097' title='17097'>I thought it might have reached your ears.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17098' title='17098'>Holmes shot out his long, thin arm and picked out Volume 'H' in his encyclopaedia of reference.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17099' title='17099'>'"Holdernesse, sixth Duke, K.G., P.C."	half the alphabet! </span>
<span sid='17100' title='17100'>"Baron Beverley, Earl of Carston" - dear me, what a list! </span>
<span sid='17101' title='17101'>"Lord-Lieutenant of Hallamshire since 1900. </span>
<span sid='17102' title='17102'>Married Edith, daughter of Sir Charles Appledore, 1888. </span>
<span sid='17103' title='17103'>Heir and only child, Lord Saltire. </span>
<span sid='17104' title='17104'>Owns about two hundred and fifty thousand acres. </span>
<span sid='17105' title='17105'>Minerals in Lancashire and <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Wales&t=h'>Wales</a>. </span>
<span sid='17106' title='17106'>Address: Carlton House Terrace; Holdernesse Hall, Hallamshire; Carston Castle, Bangor, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Wales&t=h'>Wales</a>. </span>
<span sid='17107' title='17107'>Lord of the Admiralty, 1872; Chief Secretary of State for-" Well, well, this man is certainly one of the greatest subjects of the Crown!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17108' title='17108'>'The greatest and perhaps the wealthiest. </span>
<span sid='17109' title='17109'>I am aware, Mr Holmes, that you take a very high line in professional matters, and that you are prepared to work for the work's sake. </span>
<span sid='17110' title='17110'>I may tell you, however, that his Grace has already intimated that a cheque for five thousand pounds will be handed over to the person who can tell him where his son is, and another thousand to him who can name the man, or men, who have taken him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17111' title='17111'>'It is a princely offer,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='17112' title='17112'>'Watson, I think that we shall accompany Dr Huxtable back to the North of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>. </span>
<span sid='17113' title='17113'>And now, Dr Huxtable, when you have consumed that milk you will kindly tell me what has happened, when it happened, how it happened, and, finally, what Dr Thorneycroft Huxtable, of the Priory School, near Mackleton, has to do with the matter, and why he comes three days after an event - the state of your chin gives the date - to ask for my humble services.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17114' title='17114'>Our visitor had consumed his milk and biscuits. </span>
<span sid='17115' title='17115'>The light had come back to his eyes and the colour to his cheeks as he set himself with great vigour and lucidity to explain the situation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17116' title='17116'>'I must inform you, gentlemen, that the Priory is a preparatory school, of which I am the founder and principal. </span>
<span sid='17117' title='17117'>Huxtable's Sidelights on Horace may possibly recall my name to your memories. </span>
<span sid='17118' title='17118'>The Priory is, without exception, the best and most select preparatory school in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>. </span>
<span sid='17119' title='17119'>Lord Leverstoke, the Earl of Blackwater, Sir Cathcart Soames - they all have entrusted their sons to me. </span>
<span sid='17120' title='17120'>But I felt that my school had reached its zenith when, three weeks ago, the Duke of Holdernesse sent Mr James Wilder, his secretary, with the intimation that young Lord Saltire, ten years old, his only son and heir, was about to be committed to my charge. </span>
<span sid='17121' title='17121'>Little did I think that this would be the prelude to the most crushing misfortune of my life.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17122' title='17122'>'On May 1st the boy arrived, that being the beginning of the summer term. </span>
<span sid='17123' title='17123'>He was a charming youth, and he soon fell into our ways. </span>
<span sid='17124' title='17124'>I may tell you - I trust that I am not indiscreet, but half-confidences are absurd in such a case - that he was not entirely happy at home. </span>
<span sid='17125' title='17125'>It is an open secret that the Duke's married life had not been a peaceful one, and the matter had ended in a separation by mutual consent, the Duchess taking up her residence in the South of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>. </span>
<span sid='17126' title='17126'>This had occurred very shortly before, and the boy's sympathies are known to have been strongly with his mother. </span>
<span sid='17127' title='17127'>He moped after her departure from Holdernesse Hall, and it was for this reason that the Duke desired to send him to my establishment. </span>
<span sid='17128' title='17128'>In a fortnight the boy was quite at home with us, and was apparently absolutely happy.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17129' title='17129'>'He was last seen on the night of May 13th - that is, the night of last Monday. </span>
<span sid='17130' title='17130'>His room was on the second floor, and was approached through another larger room in which two boys were sleeping. </span>
<span sid='17131' title='17131'>These boys saw and heard nothing, so that it is certain that young Saltire did not pass out that way. </span>
<span sid='17132' title='17132'>His window was open, and there is a stout ivy plant leading to the ground. </span>
<span sid='17133' title='17133'>We could trace no footmarks below, but it is sure that this is the only possible exit.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17134' title='17134'>'His absence was discovered at seven o'clock on Tuesday morning. </span>
<span sid='17135' title='17135'>His bed had been slept in. </span>
<span sid='17136' title='17136'>He had dressed himself fully before going off in his usual school suit of black <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Eton&t=h'>Eton</a> jacket and dark grey trousers. </span>
<span sid='17137' title='17137'>There were no signs that anyone had entered the room, and it is quite certain that anything in the nature of cries or a struggle would have been heard, since Caunter, the elder boy in the inner room, is a very light sleeper.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17138' title='17138'>'When Lord Saltire's disappearance was discovered I at once called a roll of the whole establishment - boys, masters, and servants. </span>
<span sid='17139' title='17139'>It was then that we ascertained that Lord Saltire had not been alone in his flight. </span>
<span sid='17140' title='17140'>Heidegger, the German master, was missing. </span>
<span sid='17141' title='17141'>His room was on the second floor, at the farther end of the building, facing the same way as Lord Saltire's. </span>
<span sid='17142' title='17142'>His bed had also been slept in; but he had apparently gone away partly dressed, since his shirt and socks were lying on the floor. </span>
<span sid='17143' title='17143'>He had undoubtedly let himself down by the ivy, for we could see the marks of his feet where he had landed on the lawn. </span>
<span sid='17144' title='17144'>His bicycle was kept in a small shed beside this lawn, and it also was gone.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17145' title='17145'>'He had been with me for two years, and came with the best references; but he was a silent, morose man, not very popular with either masters or boys. </span>
<span sid='17146' title='17146'>No trace could be found of the fugitives, and now on Thursday morning we are as ignorant as we were on Tuesday. </span>
<span sid='17147' title='17147'>Inquiry was, of course, made at once at Holdernesse Hall. </span>
<span sid='17148' title='17148'>It is only a few miles away, and we imagined that in some sudden attack of homesickness he had gone back to his father; but nothing had been heard of him. </span>
<span sid='17149' title='17149'>The Duke is greatly agitated -  and as to me, you have seen yourselves the state of nervous prostration to which the suspense and the responsibility have reduced me. </span>
<span sid='17150' title='17150'>Mr Holmes, if ever you put forward your full powers, I implore you to do so now, for never in your life could you have a case which is more worthy of them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17151' title='17151'>Sherlock Holmes had listened with the utmost intentness to the statement of the unhappy schoolmaster. </span>
<span sid='17152' title='17152'>His drawn brows and the deep furrow between them showed that he needed no exhortation to concentrate all his attention upon a problem which, apart from the tremendous interests involved, must appeal so directly to his love of the complex and the unusual. </span>
<span sid='17153' title='17153'>He now drew out his note-book and jotted down one or two memoranda.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17154' title='17154'>'You have been very remiss in not coming to me sooner,' said he severely. </span>
<span sid='17155' title='17155'>'You start me on my investigation with a very serious handicap. </span>
<span sid='17156' title='17156'>It is inconceivable, for example, that this ivy and this lawn would have yielded nothing to an expert observer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17157' title='17157'>'I am not to blame, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='17158' title='17158'>His Grace was extremely desirous to avoid all public scandal. </span>
<span sid='17159' title='17159'>He was afraid of his family unhappiness being dragged before the world. </span>
<span sid='17160' title='17160'>He has a deep horror of anything of the kind.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17161' title='17161'>'But there has been some official investigation?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17162' title='17162'>'Yes, sir, and it has proved most disappointing. </span>
<span sid='17163' title='17163'>An apparent clue was at once obtained, since a boy and a young man were reported to have been seen leaving a neighbouring station by an early train. </span>
<span sid='17164' title='17164'>Only last night we had news that the couple had been hunted down in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Liverpool&t=h'>Liverpool</a>, and they prove to have no connection whatever with the matter in hand. </span>
<span sid='17165' title='17165'>Then it was that in my despair and disappointment, after a sleepless night, I came straight to you by the early train.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17166' title='17166'>'I suppose the local investigation was relaxed while this false clue was being followed up?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17167' title='17167'>'It was entirely dropped.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17168' title='17168'>'So that three days have been wasted. </span>
<span sid='17169' title='17169'>The affair has been most deplorably handled.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17170' title='17170'>'I feel it, and admit it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17171' title='17171'>'And yet the problem should be capable of ultimate solution. </span>
<span sid='17172' title='17172'>I shall be very happy to look into it. </span>
<span sid='17173' title='17173'>Have you been able to trace any connection between the missing boy and this German master?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17174' title='17174'>'None at all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17175' title='17175'>'Was he in the master's class?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17176' title='17176'>'No; he never exchanged a word with him, so far as I know.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17177' title='17177'>'That is certainly very singular. </span>
<span sid='17178' title='17178'>Had the boy a bicycle?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17179' title='17179'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17180' title='17180'>'Was any other bicycle missing?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17181' title='17181'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17182' title='17182'>'Is that certain?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17183' title='17183'>'Quite.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17184' title='17184'>'Well, now, you do not mean to seriously suggest that this German rode off upon a bicycle in the dead of the night bearing the boy in his arms?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17185' title='17185'>'Certainly not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17186' title='17186'>'Then what is the theory in your mind?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17187' title='17187'>The bicycle may have been a blind. </span>
<span sid='17188' title='17188'>It may have been hidden somewhere, and the pair gone off on foot.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17189' title='17189'>'Quite so; but it seems rather an absurd blind, does it not? </span>
<span sid='17190' title='17190'>Were there other bicycles in this shed?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17191' title='17191'>'Several.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17192' title='17192'>'Would he not have hidden a couple had he desired to give the idea that they had gone off upon them?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17193' title='17193'>'I suppose he would.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17194' title='17194'>'Of course he would. </span>
<span sid='17195' title='17195'>The blind theory won't do. </span>
<span sid='17196' title='17196'>But the incident is an admirable starting-point for an investigation. </span>
<span sid='17197' title='17197'>After all, a bicycle is not an easy thing to conceal or to destroy. </span>
<span sid='17198' title='17198'>One other question. </span>
<span sid='17199' title='17199'>Did anyone call to see the boy on the day before he disappeared?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17200' title='17200'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17201' title='17201'>'Did he get any letters?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17202' title='17202'>'Yes; one letter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17203' title='17203'>'From whom?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17204' title='17204'>'From his father.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17205' title='17205'>'Do you open the boys' letters?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17206' title='17206'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17207' title='17207'>'How do you know it was from the father?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17208' title='17208'>'The coat-of-arms was on the envelope, and it was addressed in the Duke's peculiar stiff hand. </span>
<span sid='17209' title='17209'>Besides, the duke remembers having written.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17210' title='17210'>'When had he a letter before that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17211' title='17211'>'Not for several days.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17212' title='17212'>'Had he ever had one from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17213' title='17213'>'No; never.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17214' title='17214'>'You see the point of my questions, of course. </span>
<span sid='17215' title='17215'>Either the boy was carried off by force or he went of his own free will. </span>
<span sid='17216' title='17216'>In the latter case you would expect that some prompting from outside would be needed to make so young a lad do such a thing. </span>
<span sid='17217' title='17217'>If he has had no visitors, that prompting must have come in letters. </span>
<span sid='17218' title='17218'>Hence I try to find out who were his correspondents.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17219' title='17219'>'I fear I cannot help you much. </span>
<span sid='17220' title='17220'>His only correspondent, so far s I know, was his own father.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17221' title='17221'>'Who wrote to him on the very day of his disappearance. </span>
<span sid='17222' title='17222'>Were the relations between father and son very friendly?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17223' title='17223'>'His Grace is never very friendly with anyone. </span>
<span sid='17224' title='17224'>He is completely immersed in large public questions, and is rather inaccessible to all ordinary emotions. </span>
<span sid='17225' title='17225'>But he was always kind to the boy in his own way.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17226' title='17226'>'But the sympathies of the latter were with the mother?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17227' title='17227'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17228' title='17228'>'Did he say so?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17229' title='17229'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17230' title='17230'>'The Duke, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17231' title='17231'>'Good heavens, no!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17232' title='17232'>'Then how could you know?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17233' title='17233'>'I have had some confidential talk with Mr James Wilder, his Grace's secretary. </span>
<span sid='17234' title='17234'>It was he who gave me the information about Lord Saltire's feelings.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17235' title='17235'>'I see. </span>
<span sid='17236' title='17236'>By the way, that last letter of the Duke's - was it found in the boy's room after he was gone?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17237' title='17237'>'No; he had taken it with him. </span>
<span sid='17238' title='17238'>I think, Mr Holmes, it is time that we were leaving for Euston.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17239' title='17239'>'I will order a four-wheeler. </span>
<span sid='17240' title='17240'>In a quarter of an hour we shall be at your service. </span>
<span sid='17241' title='17241'>If you are telegraphing home, Mr Huxtable, it would be well to allow the people in your neighbourhood to imagine that the inquiry is still going on in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Liverpool&t=h'>Liverpool</a>, or wherever else that red herring led your pack. </span>
<span sid='17242' title='17242'>In the meantime, I will do a little quiet work at your own doors, and perhaps the scent is not so cold but that two old hounds like Watson and myself may get a sniff of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17243' title='17243'>That evening found us in the cold, bracing atmosphere of the Peak country, in which Dr Huxtable's famous school is situated. </span>
<span sid='17244' title='17244'>It was already dark when we reached it. </span>
<span sid='17245' title='17245'>A card was lying on the hall table, and the butler whispered something to his master, who turned to us with agitation in every heavy feature.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17246' title='17246'>'The Duke is here,' said he. </span>
<span sid='17247' title='17247'>The Duke and Mr Wilder are in the study. </span>
<span sid='17248' title='17248'>Come, gentlemen, and I will introduce you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17249' title='17249'>I was, of course, familiar with the pictures of the famous statesman, but the man himself was very different from his representation. </span>
<span sid='17250' title='17250'>He was a tall and stately person, scrupulously dressed, with a drawn, thin face, and a nose which was grotesquely curved and long. </span>
<span sid='17251' title='17251'>His complexion was of a dead pallor, which was more startling by contrast with a long, dwindling beard of vivid red, which flowed down over his white waistcoat, with his watch-chain gleaming through its fringe. </span>
<span sid='17252' title='17252'>Such was the stately presence who looked stonily at us from the centre of Dr Huxtable's hearthrug. </span>
<span sid='17253' title='17253'>Beside him stood a very young man, whom I understood to be Wilder, the private secretary. </span>
<span sid='17254' title='17254'>He was small, nervous, alert, with intelligent, light blue eyes and mobile features. </span>
<span sid='17255' title='17255'>It was he who at once, in an incisive and positive tone, opened the conversation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17256' title='17256'>'I called this morning, Dr Huxtable, too late to prevent you from starting for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='17257' title='17257'>I learned that your object was to invite Mr Sherlock Holmes to undertake the conduct of this case. </span>
<span sid='17258' title='17258'>His Grace is surprised, Dr Huxtable, that you should have taken such a step without consulting him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17259' title='17259'>'When I learned the police had failed-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17260' title='17260'>'His Grace is by no means convinced that the police have failed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17261' title='17261'>'But surely, Mr Wilder-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17262' title='17262'>'You are well aware, Dr Huxtable, that his Grace is particularly anxious to avoid all public scandal. </span>
<span sid='17263' title='17263'>He prefers to take as few people as possible into his confidence.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17264' title='17264'>The matter can be easily remedied,' said the brow-beaten doctor. </span>
<span sid='17265' title='17265'>'Mr Sherlock Holmes can return to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> by the morning train.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17266' title='17266'>'Hardly that, Doctor, hardly that,' said Holmes, in his blandest voice. </span>
<span sid='17267' title='17267'>'This northern air is invigorating and pleasant, so I propose to spend a few days upon your moors, and to occupy my mind as best I may. </span>
<span sid='17268' title='17268'>Whether I have the shelter of your roof or of the village inn is, of course, for you to decide.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17269' title='17269'>I could see that the unfortunate doctor was in the last stage of indecision, from which he was rescued by the deep, sonorous voice of the red-bearded Duke, which boomed out like a dinner-gong.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17270' title='17270'>'I agree with Mr Wilder, Dr Huxtable, that you would have done wisely to consult me. </span>
<span sid='17271' title='17271'>But since Mr Holmes has already been taken into your confidence, it would indeed be absurd that we should not avail ourselves of his services. </span>
<span sid='17272' title='17272'>Far from going to the inn, Mr Holmes, I should be pleased if you would come and stay with me at Holdernesse Hall?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17273' title='17273'>'I thank your Grace. </span>
<span sid='17274' title='17274'>For the purposes of my investigation I think that it would be wiser for me to remain at the scene of the mystery.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17275' title='17275'>'Just as you like, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='17276' title='17276'>Any information which Mr Wilder or I can give you is, of course, at your disposal.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17277' title='17277'>'It will probably be necessary for me to see you at the Hall,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='17278' title='17278'>'I would only ask you now, sir, whether you have formed any explanation in your own mind as to the mysterious disappearance of your son?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17279' title='17279'>'No, sir, I have not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17280' title='17280'>'Excuse me if I allude to that which is painful to you, but I have no alternative. </span>
<span sid='17281' title='17281'>Do you think that the Duchess had anything to do with the matter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17282' title='17282'>The great Minister showed perceptible hesitation. </span>
<span sid='17283' title='17283'>'I do not think so,' he said, at last.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17284' title='17284'>'The other most obvious explanation is that the child has been kidnapped for the purpose of levying ransom. </span>
<span sid='17285' title='17285'>You have not had any demand of the sort?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17286' title='17286'>'No, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17287' title='17287'>'One more question, your Grace. </span>
<span sid='17288' title='17288'>I understand that you wrote to your son upon the day when this incident occurred.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17289' title='17289'>'No; I wrote upon the day before.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17290' title='17290'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='17291' title='17291'>But he received it on that day?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17292' title='17292'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17293' title='17293'>'Was there anything in your letter which might have unbalanced him or induced him to take such a step?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17294' title='17294'>'No, sir, certainly not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17295' title='17295'>'Did you post that letter yourself?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17296' title='17296'>The nobleman's reply was interrupted by his secretary, who broke in with some heat.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17297' title='17297'>'His Grace is not in the habit of posting letters himself,' said he. </span>
<span sid='17298' title='17298'>'This letter was laid with others upon the study table, and I myself put them in the post-bag.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17299' title='17299'>'You are sure this one was among them?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17300' title='17300'>'Yes; I observed it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17301' title='17301'>'How many letters did your Grace write that day?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17302' title='17302'>'Twenty or thirty. </span>
<span sid='17303' title='17303'>I have a large correspondence. </span>
<span sid='17304' title='17304'>But surely this is somewhat irrelevant?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17305' title='17305'>'Not entirely,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17306' title='17306'>'For my own part,' the Duke continued, 'I have advised the police to turn their attention to the South of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>. </span>
<span sid='17307' title='17307'>I have already said that I do not believe that the Duchess would encourage so monstrous an action, but the lad had the most wrong-headed opinions, and it is possible that he may have fled to her, aided and abetted by this German. </span>
<span sid='17308' title='17308'>I think, Dr Huxtable, that we will now return to the Hall.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17309' title='17309'>I could see that there were other questions which Holmes would have wished to put; but the nobleman's abrupt manner showed that the interview was at end. </span>
<span sid='17310' title='17310'>It was evident that to his intensely aristocratic nature this discussion of his intimate family affairs with a stranger was most abhorrent, and that he feared lest every fresh question would throw a fiercer light into the discreetly shadowed corners of his ducal history.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17311' title='17311'>When the nobleman and his secretary had left, my friend flung himself at once with characteristic eagerness into the investigation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17312' title='17312'>The boy's chamber was carefully examined, and yielded nothing save the absolute conviction that it was only through the window that he could have escaped. </span>
<span sid='17313' title='17313'>The German master's room and effects gave no further clue. </span>
<span sid='17314' title='17314'>In his case a trailer of ivy had given way under his weight, and we saw by the light of a lantern the mark on the lawn where his heels had come down. </span>
<span sid='17315' title='17315'>That one dent in the short green grass was the only material witness left of this inexplicable nocturnal flight.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17316' title='17316'>Sherlock Holmes left the house alone, and only returned after eleven. </span>
<span sid='17317' title='17317'>He had obtained a large ordnance map of the neighbourhood, and this he brought into my room, where he laid it out on the bed, and, having balanced the lamp in the middle of it, he began to smoke over it, and occasionally to point out objects of interest with the reeking amber of his Pipe.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17318' title='17318'>'This case grows upon me, Watson,' said he. </span>
<span sid='17319' title='17319'>'There are decidedly some points of interest in connection with it. </span>
<span sid='17320' title='17320'>In this early stage I want you to realize these geographical features, which may have a good deal to do with our investigation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17321' title='17321'>'Look at this map.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17322' title='17322'>This dark square is the Priory School. </span>
<span sid='17323' title='17323'>I'll put a pin in it. </span>
<span sid='17324' title='17324'>Now, this line is the main road. </span>
<span sid='17325' title='17325'>You see that it runs east and west past the school, and you see also there is no side road for a mile either way. </span>
<span sid='17326' title='17326'>If these two folk passed away by road it was this road.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17327' title='17327'>'Exactly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17328' title='17328'>'By a singular and happy chance we are able to some extent to check what passed along this road during the night in question. </span>
<span sid='17329' title='17329'>At this point, where my pipe is now resting, a country constable was on duty from twelve to six. </span>
<span sid='17330' title='17330'>It is, as you perceive, the first cross road on the east side. </span>
<span sid='17331' title='17331'>'This man declares that he was not absent from his post for an instant, and he is positive that neither boy nor man could have gone that way unseen. </span>
<span sid='17332' title='17332'>I have spoken with this policeman to-night, and he appears to me to be a perfectly reliable person. </span>
<span sid='17333' title='17333'>That blocks this end. </span>
<span sid='17334' title='17334'>We have now to deal with the other. </span>
<span sid='17335' title='17335'>There is an inn here, the "Red Bull", the landlady of which was ill. </span>
<span sid='17336' title='17336'>She had sent to Mackleton for a doctor, but he did not arrive until morning, being absent at another case. </span>
<span sid='17337' title='17337'>The people at the inn were alert all night, awaiting his coming, and one or other of them seems to have continually had an eye upon the road. </span>
<span sid='17338' title='17338'>They declare that no one passed. </span>
<span sid='17339' title='17339'>If their evidence is good, then we are fortunate enough to be able to block the west, and also to be able to say that the fugitives did not use the road at all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17340' title='17340'>'But the bicycle?' I objected.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17341' title='17341'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='17342' title='17342'>We will come to the bicycle presently. </span>
<span sid='17343' title='17343'>To continue our reasoning: if these people did not go by the road, they must have traversed the country to the north of the house or to the south of the house. </span>
<span sid='17344' title='17344'>That is certain. </span>
<span sid='17345' title='17345'>Let us weigh the one against the other. </span>
<span sid='17346' title='17346'>On the south of the house is, as you perceive, a large district of arable land, cut up into small fields, with stone walls between them. </span>
<span sid='17347' title='17347'>There, I admit that a bicycle is impossible. </span>
<span sid='17348' title='17348'>We can dismiss the idea. </span>
<span sid='17349' title='17349'>We turn to the country on the north. </span>
<span sid='17350' title='17350'>Here there lies a grove of trees, marked as the "Ragged Shaw", and on the farther side stretches a great rolling moor, Lower Gill Moor, extending for ten miles, and sloping gradually upwards. </span>
<span sid='17351' title='17351'>Here, at one side of this wilderness, is Holdernesse Hall, ten miles by road, but only six across the moor. </span>
<span sid='17352' title='17352'>It is a peculiarly desolate plain. </span>
<span sid='17353' title='17353'>A few moor farmers have small holdings, where they rear sheep and cattle. </span>
<span sid='17354' title='17354'>Except these, the plover and the curlew are the only inhabitants until you come to the Chesterfield high road. </span>
<span sid='17355' title='17355'>There is a church there, you see, a few cottages, and an inn. </span>
<span sid='17356' title='17356'>Beyond that the hills become precipitous. </span>
<span sid='17357' title='17357'>Surely it is here to the north that our quest must lie.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17358' title='17358'>'But the bicycle?' I persisted.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17359' title='17359'>'Well, well!' said Holmes impatiently. </span>
<span sid='17360' title='17360'>'A good cyclist does not need a high road. </span>
<span sid='17361' title='17361'>The moor is intersected with paths, and the moon was at the full. </span>
<span sid='17362' title='17362'>Hullo! </span>
<span sid='17363' title='17363'>What is this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17364' title='17364'>There was an agitated knock at the door, and an instant afterwards Dr Huxtable was in the room. </span>
<span sid='17365' title='17365'>In his hand he held a blue cricket-cap, with a white chevron on the peak.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17366' title='17366'>'At last we have a clue,' he cried. </span>
<span sid='17367' title='17367'>'Thank Heaven at last we are on the dear boy's track! </span>
<span sid='17368' title='17368'>It is his cap.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17369' title='17369'>'Where was it found?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17370' title='17370'>'In the van of the gipsies who camped on the moor. </span>
<span sid='17371' title='17371'>They left on Tuesday. </span>
<span sid='17372' title='17372'>To-day the police traced them down and examined their caravan. </span>
<span sid='17373' title='17373'>This was found.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17374' title='17374'>'How do they account for it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17375' title='17375'>'They shuffled and lied - said that they found it on the moor on Tuesday morning. </span>
<span sid='17376' title='17376'>They know where he is, the rascals! </span>
<span sid='17377' title='17377'>Thank goodness, they are all safe under lock and key. </span>
<span sid='17378' title='17378'>Either the fear of the law or the Duke's purse will certainly get out of them all that they know.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17379' title='17379'>'So far, so good,' said Holmes, when the doctor had at last left the room. </span>
<span sid='17380' title='17380'>'It at least bears out the theory that it is on the side of the Lower Gill Moor that we must hope for results. </span>
<span sid='17381' title='17381'>The police have really done nothing locally, save the arrest of these gipsies. </span>
<span sid='17382' title='17382'>Look here, Watson! </span>
<span sid='17383' title='17383'>There is a watercourse across the moor. </span>
<span sid='17384' title='17384'>You see it marked here in the map. </span>
<span sid='17385' title='17385'>In some parts it widens into a morass. </span>
<span sid='17386' title='17386'>This is particularly so in the region between Holdernesse Hall and the school. </span>
<span sid='17387' title='17387'>It is vain to look elsewhere for tracks in this dry weather; but at that point there is certainly a chance of some record being left. </span>
<span sid='17388' title='17388'>I will call you early to-morrow morning, and you and I will try if we can to throw some light upon the mystery.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17389' title='17389'>The day was just breaking when I woke to find the long, thin form of Holmes by my bedside. </span>
<span sid='17390' title='17390'>He was fully dressed, and had apparently already been out.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17391' title='17391'>'I have done the lawn and the bicycle shed,' said he. </span>
<span sid='17392' title='17392'>'I have also had a ramble through the Ragged Shaw. </span>
<span sid='17393' title='17393'>Now, Watson, there is cocoa ready in the next room. </span>
<span sid='17394' title='17394'>I must beg you to hurry, for we have a great day before us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17395' title='17395'>His eyes shone, and his cheek was flushed with the exhilaration of the master workman who sees his work lies ready before him. </span>
<span sid='17396' title='17396'>A very different Holmes, this active, alert man, from the introspective and pallid dreamer of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='17397' title='17397'>I felt, as I looked upon that supple figure, alive with nervous energy, that it was indeed a strenuous day that awaited us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17398' title='17398'>And yet it opened in the blackest disappointment. </span>
<span sid='17399' title='17399'>With high hopes we struck across the peaty, russet moor, intersected with a thousand sheep paths, until we came to the broad, light-green belt which marked the morass between us and Holdernesse. </span>
<span sid='17400' title='17400'>Certainly, if the lad had gone homewards, he must have passed this, and he could not pass it without leaving his trace. </span>
<span sid='17401' title='17401'>But no sign of him or the German could be seen. </span>
<span sid='17402' title='17402'>With a darkening face my friend strode along the margin, eagerly observant of every muddy stain upon the mossy surface. </span>
<span sid='17403' title='17403'>Sheep-marks there were in profusion, and at one place, some miles down, cows had left their tracks. </span>
<span sid='17404' title='17404'>Nothing more.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17405' title='17405'>'Check number one,' said Holmes, looking gloomily over the rolling expanse of the moor. </span>
<span sid='17406' title='17406'>'There is another morass down yonder, and a narrow neck between. </span>
<span sid='17407' title='17407'>Hullo! hullo! hullo! </span>
<span sid='17408' title='17408'>What have we here?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17409' title='17409'>We had come on a small black ribbon of pathway. </span>
<span sid='17410' title='17410'>In the middle of it, clearly marked on the sodden soil, was the track of a bicycle.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17411' title='17411'>'Hurrah!' I cried. </span>
<span sid='17412' title='17412'>'We have it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17413' title='17413'>But Holmes was shaking his head, and his face was puzzled and expectant rather than joyous.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17414' title='17414'>'A bicycle certainly, but not the bicycle,' said he. </span>
<span sid='17415' title='17415'>'I am familiar with forty-two different impressions left by tyres. </span>
<span sid='17416' title='17416'>This, as you perceive, is a Dunlop, with a patch upon the outer cover. </span>
<span sid='17417' title='17417'>Heidegger's tyres were Palmers, leaving longitudinal stripes. </span>
<span sid='17418' title='17418'>Aveling, the mathematical master, was sure upon the point. </span>
<span sid='17419' title='17419'>Therefore it is not Heidegger's track.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17420' title='17420'>'The boy's, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17421' title='17421'>'Possibly, if we could prove a bicycle to have been in his possession. </span>
<span sid='17422' title='17422'>But this we have utterly failed to do. </span>
<span sid='17423' title='17423'>This track, as you perceive, was made by a rider who was going from the direction of the school.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17424' title='17424'>'Or towards it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17425' title='17425'>'No, no, my dear Watson. </span>
<span sid='17426' title='17426'>The more deeply sunk impression is, of course, the hind wheel, upon which the weight rests. </span>
<span sid='17427' title='17427'>You perceive several places where it has passed across and obliterated the more shallow mark of the front one. </span>
<span sid='17428' title='17428'>It was undoubtedly heading away from the school. </span>
<span sid='17429' title='17429'>It may or may not be connected with our inquiry, but we will follow it backwards before we go any farther.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17430' title='17430'>We did so, and at the end of a few hundred yards lost the tracks as we emerged from the boggy portion of the moor. </span>
<span sid='17431' title='17431'>Following the path backwards, we picked out another spot, where a spring trickled across it. </span>
<span sid='17432' title='17432'>Here, once again, was the mark of the bicycle, though nearly obliterated by the hoofs of cows. </span>
<span sid='17433' title='17433'>After that there was no sign, but the path ran right on into Ragged Shaw, the wood which backed on to the school. </span>
<span sid='17434' title='17434'>From this wood the cycle must have emerged. </span>
<span sid='17435' title='17435'>Holmes sat down on a boulder and rested his chin in his hands. </span>
<span sid='17436' title='17436'>I had smoked two cigarettes before he moved.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17437' title='17437'>'Well, well,' said he at last. </span>
<span sid='17438' title='17438'>'It is, of course, possible that a cunning man might change the tyre of his bicycle in order to leave unfamiliar tracks. </span>
<span sid='17439' title='17439'>A criminal who was capable of such a thought is a man whom I should be proud to do business with. </span>
<span sid='17440' title='17440'>We will leave this question undecided and hark back to our morass again, for we have left a good deal unexplored.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17441' title='17441'>We continued our systematic survey of the edge of the sodden portion of the moor, and soon our perseverance was gloriously rewarded. </span>
<span sid='17442' title='17442'>Right across the lower part of the bog lay a miry path. </span>
<span sid='17443' title='17443'>Holmes gave a cry of delight as he approached it. </span>
<span sid='17444' title='17444'>An impression like a fine bundle of telegraph wires ran down the centre of it. </span>
<span sid='17445' title='17445'>It was the Palmer tyre.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17446' title='17446'>'Here is Herr Heidegger, sure enough!' cried Holmes exultantly. </span>
<span sid='17447' title='17447'>'My reasoning seems to have been pretty sound, Watson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17448' title='17448'>'I congratulate you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17449' title='17449'>'But we have a long way still to go. </span>
<span sid='17450' title='17450'>Kindly walk clear of the path. </span>
<span sid='17451' title='17451'>Now let us follow the trail. </span>
<span sid='17452' title='17452'>I fear that it will not lead very far.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17453' title='17453'>We found, however, as we advanced, that this portion of the moor was intersected with soft patches, and, though we frequently lost sight of the track, we always succeeded in picking it up once more.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17454' title='17454'>'Do you observe,' said Holmes, 'that the rider is now undoubtedly forcing the pace? </span>
<span sid='17455' title='17455'>There can be no doubt of it. </span>
<span sid='17456' title='17456'>Look at this impression, where you get both tyres clear. </span>
<span sid='17457' title='17457'>The one is as deep as the other. </span>
<span sid='17458' title='17458'>That can only mean that the rider is throwing his weight on to the handle-bar as a man does when he is sprinting. </span>
<span sid='17459' title='17459'>By Jove! he has had a fall.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17460' title='17460'>There was a broad irregular smudge covering some yards of the track. </span>
<span sid='17461' title='17461'>Then there were a few footmarks, and the tyre reappeared once more.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17462' title='17462'>'A side-slip,' I suggested.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17463' title='17463'>Holmes held up a crumpled branch of flowering gorse. </span>
<span sid='17464' title='17464'>To my horror I perceived that the yellow blossoms were all dabbled with crimson. </span>
<span sid='17465' title='17465'>On the path, too, and among the heather were dark stains of clotted blood.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17466' title='17466'>'Bad!' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='17467' title='17467'>'Bad! </span>
<span sid='17468' title='17468'>Stand clear, Watson! </span>
<span sid='17469' title='17469'>Not an unnecessary footstep! </span>
<span sid='17470' title='17470'>What do I read here? </span>
<span sid='17471' title='17471'>He fell wounded, he stood up, he remounted, he proceeded. </span>
<span sid='17472' title='17472'>But there is no other track. </span>
<span sid='17473' title='17473'>Cattle on this side path. </span>
<span sid='17474' title='17474'>He was surely not gored by a bull? </span>
<span sid='17475' title='17475'>Impossible! </span>
<span sid='17476' title='17476'>But I see no traces of anyone else. </span>
<span sid='17477' title='17477'>We must push on, Watson. </span>
<span sid='17478' title='17478'>Surely, with stains as well as the track to guide us, he cannot escape us now.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17479' title='17479'>Our search was not a very long one. </span>
<span sid='17480' title='17480'>The tracks of the tyre began to curve fantastically upon the wet and shining path. </span>
<span sid='17481' title='17481'>Suddenly, as I looked ahead, the gleam of metal caught my eye from amid the thick gorse bushes. </span>
<span sid='17482' title='17482'>Out of them we dragged a bicycle, Palmer-tyred, one pedal bent, and the whole front of it horribly smeared and slobbered with blood. </span>
<span sid='17483' title='17483'>On the other side of the bushes a shoe was projecting. </span>
<span sid='17484' title='17484'>We ran round, and there lay the unfortunate rider. </span>
<span sid='17485' title='17485'>He was a tall man, full bearded, with spectacles, one glass of which had been knocked out. </span>
<span sid='17486' title='17486'>The cause of his death was a frightful blow upon the head, which had crushed in part of his skull. </span>
<span sid='17487' title='17487'>That he could have gone on after receiving such an injury said much for the vitality and courage of the man. </span>
<span sid='17488' title='17488'>He wore shoes, but no socks, and his open coat disclosed a night-shirt beneath it. </span>
<span sid='17489' title='17489'>It was undoubtedly the German master.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17490' title='17490'>Holmes turned the body over reverently, and examined it with great attention. </span>
<span sid='17491' title='17491'>He then sat in deep thought for a time, and I could see by his ruffled brow that this grim discovery had not, in his opinion, advanced us much in our inquiry.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17492' title='17492'>'It is a little difficult to know what to do, Watson,' said he, at last. </span>
<span sid='17493' title='17493'>'My own inclinations are to push this inquiry on, for we have already lost so much time that we cannot afford to waste another hour. </span>
<span sid='17494' title='17494'>On the other hand, we are bound to inform the police of this discovery, and to see that this poor fellow's body is looked after.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17495' title='17495'>'I could take a note back.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17496' title='17496'>'But I need your company and assistance. </span>
<span sid='17497' title='17497'>Wait a bit! </span>
<span sid='17498' title='17498'>There is a fellow cutting peat up yonder. </span>
<span sid='17499' title='17499'>Bring him over here, and he will guide the police.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17500' title='17500'>I brought the peasant across, and Holmes dispatched the frightened man with a note to Dr Huxtable.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17501' title='17501'>'Now, Watson,' said he, 'we have picked up two clues this morning. </span>
<span sid='17502' title='17502'>One is the bicycle with the Palmer tyre, and we see what that has led to. </span>
<span sid='17503' title='17503'>The other is the bicycle with the patched Dunlop. </span>
<span sid='17504' title='17504'>Before we start to investigate that, let us try to realize what we do know, so as to make the most of it, and to separate the essential from the accidental.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17505' title='17505'>'First of all, I wish to impress upon you that the boy certainly left of his own free will. </span>
<span sid='17506' title='17506'>He got down from his window and he went off, either alone or with someone. </span>
<span sid='17507' title='17507'>That is sure.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17508' title='17508'>I assented.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17509' title='17509'>'Well, now, let us turn to this unfortunate German master. </span>
<span sid='17510' title='17510'>The boy was fully dressed when he fled. </span>
<span sid='17511' title='17511'>Therefore he foresaw what he would do. </span>
<span sid='17512' title='17512'>But the German went without his socks. </span>
<span sid='17513' title='17513'>He certainly acted on very short notice.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17514' title='17514'>'Undoubtedly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17515' title='17515'>'Why did he go? </span>
<span sid='17516' title='17516'>Because, from his bedroom window, he saw the flight of the boy. </span>
<span sid='17517' title='17517'>Because he wished to overtake him and bring him back. </span>
<span sid='17518' title='17518'>He seized his bicycle, pursued the lad, and in pursuing him met his death.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17519' title='17519'>'So it would seem.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17520' title='17520'>'Now I come to the critical part of my argument. </span>
<span sid='17521' title='17521'>The natural action of a man in pursuing a little boy would be to run after him. </span>
<span sid='17522' title='17522'>He would know that he could overtake him. </span>
<span sid='17523' title='17523'>But the German does not do so. </span>
<span sid='17524' title='17524'>He turns to his bicycle. </span>
<span sid='17525' title='17525'>I am told that he was an excellent cyclist. </span>
<span sid='17526' title='17526'>He would not do this if he did not see that the boy had some swift means of escape.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17527' title='17527'>'The other bicycle.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17528' title='17528'>'Let us continue our reconstruction. </span>
<span sid='17529' title='17529'>He meets his death five miles from the school - not by a bullet, mark you, which even a lad might conceivably discharge, but by a savage blow dealt by a vigorous arm. </span>
<span sid='17530' title='17530'>The lad, then, had a companion in his flight. </span>
<span sid='17531' title='17531'>And the flight was a swift one, since it took five miles before an expert cyclist could overtake them. </span>
<span sid='17532' title='17532'>Yet we survey the ground round the scene of the tragedy. </span>
<span sid='17533' title='17533'>What do we find? </span>
<span sid='17534' title='17534'>A few cattle tracks, nothing more. </span>
<span sid='17535' title='17535'>I took a wide sweep round, and there is no path within fifty yards. </span>
<span sid='17536' title='17536'>Another cyclist could have had nothing to do with the actual murder. </span>
<span sid='17537' title='17537'>Nor were there any human footmarks.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17538' title='17538'>'Holmes,' I cried, 'this is impossible.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17539' title='17539'>'Admirable!' he said. </span>
<span sid='17540' title='17540'>'A most illuminating remark. </span>
<span sid='17541' title='17541'>It is impossible as I state it, and therefore I must in some respect have stated it wrong. </span>
<span sid='17542' title='17542'>Yet you saw for yourself Can you suggest any fallacy?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17543' title='17543'>'He could not have fractured his skull in a fall?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17544' title='17544'>'In a morass, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17545' title='17545'>'I am at my wits' end.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17546' title='17546'>'Tut, tut; we have solved some worse problems. </span>
<span sid='17547' title='17547'>At least we have plenty of material, if we can only use it. </span>
<span sid='17548' title='17548'>Come, then, and, having exhausted the Palmer, let us see what the Dunlop with the patched cover has to offer us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17549' title='17549'>We picked up the track and followed it onwards for some distance; but soon the moor rose into a long, heather-tufted curve, and we left the watercourse behind us. </span>
<span sid='17550' title='17550'>No further help from tracks could be hoped for. </span>
<span sid='17551' title='17551'>At the spot where we saw the last of the Dunlop tyre it might equally have led to Holdernesse Hall, the stately towers of which rose some miles to our left, or to a low, grey village which lay in front of us, and marked the position of the Chesterfield high road.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17552' title='17552'>As we approached the forbidding and squalid inn, with the sign of a gamecock above the door, Holmes gave a sudden groan and clutched me by the shoulder to save himself from falling. </span>
<span sid='17553' title='17553'>He had had one of those violent strains of the ankle which leave a man helpless. </span>
<span sid='17554' title='17554'>With difficulty he limped up to the door, where a squat, dark, elderly man was smoking a black clay pipe.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17555' title='17555'>'How are you, Mr Reuben Hayes?' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17556' title='17556'>'Who are you, and how do you get my name so pat?' the countryman answered, with a suspicious flash of a pair of cunning eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17557' title='17557'>'Well, it's printed on the board above your head. </span>
<span sid='17558' title='17558'>It's easy to see a man who is master of his own house. </span>
<span sid='17559' title='17559'>I suppose you haven't such a thing as a carriage in your stables?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17560' title='17560'>'No; I have not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17561' title='17561'>'I can hardly put my foot to the ground.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17562' title='17562'>'Don't put it to the ground.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17563' title='17563'>'But I can't walk.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17564' title='17564'>'Well, then, hop.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17565' title='17565'>Mr Reuben Hayes's manner was far from gracious, but Holmes took it with admirable good humour.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17566' title='17566'>'Look here, my man,' said he. </span>
<span sid='17567' title='17567'>'This is really rather an awkward fix for me. </span>
<span sid='17568' title='17568'>I don't mind how I get on.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17569' title='17569'>'Neither do I,' said the morose landlord.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17570' title='17570'>'The matter is very important. </span>
<span sid='17571' title='17571'>I would offer you a sovereign for the use of a bicycle.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17572' title='17572'>The landlord pricked up his ears.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17573' title='17573'>'Where do you want to go?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17574' title='17574'>'To Holdernesse Hall.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17575' title='17575'>'Pals of the Dook, I suppose?' said the landlord, surveying our mud-stained garments with ironical eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17576' title='17576'>Holmes laughed good-naturedly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17577' title='17577'>'He'll be glad to see us, anyhow.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17578' title='17578'>'Why?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17579' title='17579'>'Because we bring him news of his lost son.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17580' title='17580'>The landlord gave a very visible start.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17581' title='17581'>'What, you're on his track?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17582' title='17582'>'He has been heard of in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Liverpool&t=h'>Liverpool</a>. </span>
<span sid='17583' title='17583'>They expect to get him every hour.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17584' title='17584'>Again a swift change passed over the heavy, unshaven face. </span>
<span sid='17585' title='17585'>His manner was suddenly genial.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17586' title='17586'>'I've less reason to wish the Dook well than most men,' said he, 'for I was his head coachman once, and cruel bad he treated me. </span>
<span sid='17587' title='17587'>It was him that sacked me without a character on the word of a lying corn-chandler. </span>
<span sid='17588' title='17588'>But I'm glad to hear that the young lord was heard of in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Liverpool&t=h'>Liverpool</a>, and I'll help you to take the news to the Hall.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17589' title='17589'>'Thank you,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='17590' title='17590'>'We'll have some food first. </span>
<span sid='17591' title='17591'>Then you can bring round the bicycle.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17592' title='17592'>'I haven't got a bicycle.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17593' title='17593'>Holmes held up a sovereign.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17594' title='17594'>'I tell you, man, that I haven't got one. </span>
<span sid='17595' title='17595'>I'll let you have two horses as far as the Hall.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17596' title='17596'>'Well, well,' said Holmes, 'we'll talk about it when we've had something to eat.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17597' title='17597'>When we were left alone in the stone-flagged kitchen it was astonishing how rapidly that sprained ankle recovered. </span>
<span sid='17598' title='17598'>It was nearly nightfall, and we had eaten nothing since early morning, so that we spent some time over our meal. </span>
<span sid='17599' title='17599'>Holmes was lost in thought, and once or twice he walked over to the window and stared earnestly out. </span>
<span sid='17600' title='17600'>It opened on to a squalid courtyard. </span>
<span sid='17601' title='17601'>In the far corner was a smithy, where a grimy lad was at work. </span>
<span sid='17602' title='17602'>On the side were the stables. </span>
<span sid='17603' title='17603'>Holmes had sat down again after one of these excursions, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with a loud exclamation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17604' title='17604'>'By Heaven, Watson, I believe that I've got it!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='17605' title='17605'>'Yes, yes, it must be so. </span>
<span sid='17606' title='17606'>Watson, do you remember seeing any cow-tracks to-day?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17607' title='17607'>'Yes, several.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17608' title='17608'>'Where?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17609' title='17609'>'Well, everywhere. </span>
<span sid='17610' title='17610'>They were at the morass, and again on the path, and again near where poor Heidegger met his death.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17611' title='17611'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='17612' title='17612'>Well, now, Watson, how many cows did you see on the moor?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17613' title='17613'>'I don't remember seeing any.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17614' title='17614'>'Strange, Watson, that we should see tracks all along our line, but never a cow on the whole moor; very strange, Watson, eh?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17615' title='17615'>'Yes, it is strange.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17616' title='17616'>'Now, Watson, make an effort; throw your mind back! </span>
<span sid='17617' title='17617'>Can you see those tracks upon the path?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17618' title='17618'>'Yes, I can.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17619' title='17619'>'Can you recall that the tracks were sometimes like that, Watson'	- he arranged a number of breadcrumbs in this fashion	- : : : : : - 'and sometimes like this' - :Â· :Â· :Â· :Â· -' and occasionally like this' - . Â· . Â· . Â· . Â·</span>
<p>
<span sid='17620' title='17620'>'Can you remember that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17621' title='17621'>'No, I cannot.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17622' title='17622'>'But I can. </span>
<span sid='17623' title='17623'>I could swear to it. </span>
<span sid='17624' title='17624'>However, we will go back at our leisure and verify it. </span>
<span sid='17625' title='17625'>What a blind beetle I have been not to draw my conclusion!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17626' title='17626'>'And what is your conclusion?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17627' title='17627'>'Only that it is a remarkable cow which walks, canters, and gallops. </span>
<span sid='17628' title='17628'>By George, Watson, it was no brain of a country publican that thought out such a blind as that! </span>
<span sid='17629' title='17629'>The coast seems to be clear, save for that lad in the smithy. </span>
<span sid='17630' title='17630'>Let us slip out and see what we can see.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17631' title='17631'>There were two rough-haired, unkempt horses in the tumble-down stable. </span>
<span sid='17632' title='17632'>Holmes raised the hind leg of one of them and laughed loud.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17633' title='17633'>'Old shoes, but newly shod - old shoes, but new nails.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17634' title='17634'>This case deserves to be a classic. </span>
<span sid='17635' title='17635'>Let us go across to the smithy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17636' title='17636'>The lad continued his work without regarding us. </span>
<span sid='17637' title='17637'>I saw Holmes's eye darting to right and left among the litter of iron and wood, which was scattered about the floor. </span>
<span sid='17638' title='17638'>Suddenly, however, we heard a step behind us, and there was the landlord, his heavy eyebrows drawn down over his savage eyes, his swarthy features convulsed with passion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17639' title='17639'>He held a short metal-headed stick in his hand, and he advanced in so menacing a fashion that I was right glad to feel the revolver in my pocket.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17640' title='17640'>'You infernal spies!' the man cried. </span>
<span sid='17641' title='17641'>'What are you doing there?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17642' title='17642'>'Why, Mr Reuben Hayes,' said Holmes coolly, 'one might think that you were afraid of our finding something out.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17643' title='17643'>The man mastered himself with a violent effort, and his grim mouth loosened into a false laugh, which was more menacing than his frown.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17644' title='17644'>'You're welcome to all you can find out in my smithy,' said he. </span>
<span sid='17645' title='17645'>'But look here, mister, I don't care for folk poking about my place without my leave, so the sooner you pay your score and get out of this the better I shall be pleased.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17646' title='17646'>'All right, Mr Hayes - no harm meant,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='17647' title='17647'>'We have been having a look at your horses; but I think I'll walk after all. </span>
<span sid='17648' title='17648'>It's not far, I believe.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17649' title='17649'>'Not more than two miles to the Hall gates. </span>
<span sid='17650' title='17650'>That's the road to the left.' </span>
<span sid='17651' title='17651'>He watched us with sullen eyes until we had left his premises.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17652' title='17652'>We did not go very far along the road, for Holmes stopped the instant that the curve hid us from the landlord's view.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17653' title='17653'>'We were warm, as the children say, at that inn,' said he. </span>
<span sid='17654' title='17654'>seem to grow colder every step that I take away from it. </span>
<span sid='17655' title='17655'>No, no; I can't possibly leave it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17656' title='17656'>'I am convinced,' said I, 'that this Reuben Hayes knows all about it. </span>
<span sid='17657' title='17657'>A more self-evident villain I never saw.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17658' title='17658'>'Oh! </span>
<span sid='17659' title='17659'>he impressed you in that way, did he? </span>
<span sid='17660' title='17660'>There are the horses, there is the smithy. </span>
<span sid='17661' title='17661'>Yes, it is an interesting place, this "Fighting Cock". </span>
<span sid='17662' title='17662'>I think we shall have another look at it in an unobtrusive way.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17663' title='17663'>A long, sloping hill-side, dotted with grey limestone boulders, stretched behind us. </span>
<span sid='17664' title='17664'>We had turned off the road, and were making our way up the hill, when, looking in the direction of Holdernesse Hall, I saw a cyclist coming swiftly along.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17665' title='17665'>'Get down, Watson!' cried Holmes, with a heavy hand upon my shoulder. </span>
<span sid='17666' title='17666'>We had hardly sunk from view when the man flew past us on the road. </span>
<span sid='17667' title='17667'>Amid a rolling could of dust I caught a glimpse of a pale, agitated face - a face with horror in every lineament, the mouth open, the eyes staring wildly in front. </span>
<span sid='17668' title='17668'>It was like some strange caricature of the dapper James Wilder whom we had seen the night before.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17669' title='17669'>'The Duke's secretary!' cried Holmes. </span>
<span sid='17670' title='17670'>'Come, Watson, let us see what he does.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17671' title='17671'>We scrambled from rock to rock until in a few moments we had made our way to a point from which we could see the front door of the inn. </span>
<span sid='17672' title='17672'>Wilder's bicycle was leaning against the wall beside it. </span>
<span sid='17673' title='17673'>No one was moving about the house, nor could we catch a glimpse of any faces at the windows. </span>
<span sid='17674' title='17674'>Slowly the twilight crept down as the sun sank behind the high towers of Holdernesse Hall. </span>
<span sid='17675' title='17675'>Then in the gloom we saw the two side-lamps of a trap light up in the stable-yard of the inn, and shortly afterwards heard the rattle of hoofs, as it wheeled out into the road and tore off at a furious pace in the direction of Chesterfield.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17676' title='17676'>'What do you make of that, Watson?' Holmes whispered. </span>
<span sid='17677' title='17677'>It looks like a flight:</span>
<p>
<span sid='17678' title='17678'>'A single man in a dog-cart, so far as I could see. </span>
<span sid='17679' title='17679'>Well, it certainly was not Mr James Wilder, for there he is at the door.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17680' title='17680'>A red square of light had sprung out of the darkness. </span>
<span sid='17681' title='17681'>In the middle of it was the black figure of the secretary, his head advanced, peering out into the night. </span>
<span sid='17682' title='17682'>It was evident that he was expecting someone. </span>
<span sid='17683' title='17683'>Then at last there were steps in the road, a second figure was visible for an instant against the light, the door shut, and all was black once more. </span>
<span sid='17684' title='17684'>Five minutes later a lamp was lit in a room upon the first floor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17685' title='17685'>It seems to be a curious class of custom that is done by the "Fighting Cock": said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17686' title='17686'>'The bar is on the other side.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17687' title='17687'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='17688' title='17688'>These are what one may call the private guests. </span>
<span sid='17689' title='17689'>Now, what in the world is Mr James Wilder doing in that den at this hour of night, and who is the companion who comes to meet him there? </span>
<span sid='17690' title='17690'>Come, Watson, we must really take a risk and try to investigate this a little more closely.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17691' title='17691'>Together we stole down to the road and crept across to the door of the inn. </span>
<span sid='17692' title='17692'>The bicycle still leaned against the wall. </span>
<span sid='17693' title='17693'>Holmes struck a match and held it to the back wheel, and I heard him chuckle as the light fell upon a patched Dunlop tyre. </span>
<span sid='17694' title='17694'>Up above us was the lighted window.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17695' title='17695'>'I must have a peep through that, Watson. </span>
<span sid='17696' title='17696'>If you bend your back and support yourself upon the wall, I think that I can manage.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17697' title='17697'>An instant later his feet were on my shoulders. </span>
<span sid='17698' title='17698'>But he was hardly up before he was down again.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17699' title='17699'>'Come, my friend,' said he, 'our day's work has been quite long enough. </span>
<span sid='17700' title='17700'>I think that we have gathered all that we can. </span>
<span sid='17701' title='17701'>It's a long walk to the school, and the sooner we get started the better.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17702' title='17702'>He hardly opened his lips during that weary trudge across the moor, nor would he enter the school when he reached it, but went on to Mackleton Station, whence he could send some telegrams. </span>
<span sid='17703' title='17703'>Late at night I heard him consoling Dr Huxtable, prostrated by the tragedy of his master's death, and later still he entered my room as alert and vigorous as he had been when he started in the morning. </span>
<span sid='17704' title='17704'>'All goes well, my friend,' said he, 'I promise that before to-morrow evening we shall have reached the solution of the mystery.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17705' title='17705'>At eleven o'clock next morning my friend and I were walking up the famous yew avenue of Holdernesse Hall. </span>
<span sid='17706' title='17706'>We were ushered through the magnificent Elizabethan doorway and into his Grace's study. </span>
<span sid='17707' title='17707'>There we found Mr James Wilder, demure and courtly, but with some trace of that wild terror of the night before still lurking in his furtive eyes and in his twitching features.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17708' title='17708'>'You have come to see his Grace? </span>
<span sid='17709' title='17709'>I am sorry; but the fact is that the Duke is far from well. </span>
<span sid='17710' title='17710'>He has been very much upset by the tragic news. </span>
<span sid='17711' title='17711'>We received a telegram from Dr Huxtable yesterday afternoon, which told us of your discovery.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17712' title='17712'>'I must see the Duke, Mr Wilder.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17713' title='17713'>'But he is in his room.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17714' title='17714'>'Then I must go to his room.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17715' title='17715'>'I believe he is in his bed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17716' title='17716'>'I will see him there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17717' title='17717'>Holmes's cold and inexorable manner showed the secretary that it was useless to argue with him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17718' title='17718'>'Very good, Mr Holmes; I will tell him that you are here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17719' title='17719'>After half an hour's delay the great nobleman appeared. </span>
<span sid='17720' title='17720'>His face was more cadaverous than ever, his shoulders had rounded, and he seemed to me to be an altogether older man than he had been the morning before. </span>
<span sid='17721' title='17721'>He greeted us with a stately courtesy, and seated himself at his desk, his red beard streaming down on to the table.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17722' title='17722'>'Well, Mr Holmes?' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17723' title='17723'>But my friend's eyes were fixed upon the secretary, who stood by his master's chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17724' title='17724'>'I think, your Grace, that I could speak more freely in Mr Wilder's absence.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17725' title='17725'>The man turned a shade paler and cast a malignant glance at Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17726' title='17726'>If your Grace wishes-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17727' title='17727'>'Yes, yes; you had better go. </span>
<span sid='17728' title='17728'>Now, Mr Holmes, what have you to say?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17729' title='17729'>My friend waited until the door had closed behind the retreating secretary.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17730' title='17730'>'The fact is, your Grace,' said he, 'that my colleague, Dr Watson, and myself had an assurance from Dr Huxtable that a reward had been offered in this case. </span>
<span sid='17731' title='17731'>I should like to have this confirmed from your own lips.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17732' title='17732'>'Certainly, Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17733' title='17733'>It amounted, if I am correctly informed, to five thousand pounds to anyone who will tell you where your son is?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17734' title='17734'>'Exactly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17735' title='17735'>'And another thousand to the man who will name the person or persons who keep him in custody?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17736' title='17736'>'Exactly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17737' title='17737'>'Under the latter heading is included, no doubt, not only those who may have taken him away, but also those who conspire to keep him in his present position?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17738' title='17738'>'Yes, yes,' cried the Duke impatiently. </span>
<span sid='17739' title='17739'>If you do your work well, Mr Sherlock Holmes, you will have no reason to complain of niggardly treatment.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17740' title='17740'>My friend rubbed his thin hands together with an appearance of avidity which was a surprise to me, who knew his frugal tastes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17741' title='17741'>'I fancy that I see your Grace's cheque-book upon the table,' said he, 'I should be glad if you would make me out a cheque for six thousand pounds. </span>
<span sid='17742' title='17742'>It would be as well, perhaps, for you to cross it. </span>
<span sid='17743' title='17743'>The Capital and Counties Bank, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Oxford Street&t=h'>Oxford Street</a> branch, are my agents.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17744' title='17744'>His Grace sat very stern and upright in his chair, and looked stonily at my friend.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17745' title='17745'>Is this a joke, Mr Holmes? </span>
<span sid='17746' title='17746'>It is hardly a subject for pleasantry.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17747' title='17747'>'Not at all, your Grace. </span>
<span sid='17748' title='17748'>I was never more earnest in my life.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17749' title='17749'>'What do you mean, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17750' title='17750'>'I mean that I have earned the reward, I know where your son is, and I know some, at least, of those who are holding him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17751' title='17751'>The Duke's beard had turned more aggressively red than ever against his ghastly white face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17752' title='17752'>'Where is he?' he gasped.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17753' title='17753'>'He is, or was last night, at the "Fighting Cock Inn", about two miles from your park gate.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17754' title='17754'>The Duke fell back in his chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17755' title='17755'>'And whom do you accuse?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17756' title='17756'>Sherlock Holmes's answer was an astounding one. </span>
<span sid='17757' title='17757'>He stepped swiftly forward and touched the Duke upon the shoulder.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17758' title='17758'>'I accuse you,' said he. </span>
<span sid='17759' title='17759'>'And now, your Grace, I'll trouble you for that cheque.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17760' title='17760'>Never shall I forget the Duke's appearance as he sprang up and clawed with his hands like one who is sinking into an abyss. </span>
<span sid='17761' title='17761'>Then, with an extraordinary effort of aristocratic self-command, he sat down and sank his face in his hands. </span>
<span sid='17762' title='17762'>It was some minutes before he spoke.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17763' title='17763'>'How much do you know?' he asked at last, without raising his head.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17764' title='17764'>'I saw you together last night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17765' title='17765'>'Does anyone else besides your friend know?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17766' title='17766'>'I have spoken to no one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17767' title='17767'>The Duke took a pen in his quivering fingers and opened his cheque-book.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17768' title='17768'>'I shall be as good as my word, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='17769' title='17769'>I am about to write your cheque, however unwelcome the information which you have gained may be to me. </span>
<span sid='17770' title='17770'>When the offer was first made I little thought the turn which events would take. </span>
<span sid='17771' title='17771'>But you and your friend are men of discretion, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17772' title='17772'>'I hardly understand your Grace.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17773' title='17773'>'I must put it plainly, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='17774' title='17774'>If only you two know of the incident, there is no reason why it should go any farther. </span>
<span sid='17775' title='17775'>I think twelve thousand pounds is the sum that I owe you, is it not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17776' title='17776'>But Holmes smiled, and shook his head.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17777' title='17777'>'I fear, your Grace, that matters can hardly be arranged so easily. </span>
<span sid='17778' title='17778'>There is the death of this schoolmaster to be accounted for.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17779' title='17779'>'But James knew nothing of that. </span>
<span sid='17780' title='17780'>You cannot hold him responsible for that. </span>
<span sid='17781' title='17781'>It was the work of this brutal ruffian whom he had the misfortune to employ.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17782' title='17782'>'I must take the view, your Grace, that when a man embarks upon a crime he is morally guilty of any other crime which may spring from it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17783' title='17783'>'Morally, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='17784' title='17784'>No doubt you are right. </span>
<span sid='17785' title='17785'>But surely not in the eyes of the law. </span>
<span sid='17786' title='17786'>A man cannot be condemned for a murder at which he was not present, and which he loathes and abhors as much as you do. </span>
<span sid='17787' title='17787'>The instant that he heard of it he made a complete confession to me, so filled was he with horror and remorse. </span>
<span sid='17788' title='17788'>He lost not an hour in breaking entirely with the murderer. </span>
<span sid='17789' title='17789'>Oh, Mr Holmes, you must save him -  you must save him! </span>
<span sid='17790' title='17790'>I tell you that you must save him!' </span>
<span sid='17791' title='17791'>The Duke had dropped the last attempt at self-command, and was pacing the room with a convulsed face and with his clenched hands raving in the air. </span>
<span sid='17792' title='17792'>At last he mastered himself and sat down once more at his desk. </span>
<span sid='17793' title='17793'>'I appreciate your conduct in coming here before you spoke to anyone else,' said he. </span>
<span sid='17794' title='17794'>'At least we may take counsel how far we can minimize this hideous scandal.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17795' title='17795'>'Exactly,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='17796' title='17796'>'I think, your Grace, that this can only be done by absolute and complete frankness between us. </span>
<span sid='17797' title='17797'>I am disposed to help your Grace to the best of my ability; but in order to do so I must understand to the last detail how the matter stands. </span>
<span sid='17798' title='17798'>I realize that your words applied to Mr James Wilder, and that he is not the murderer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17799' title='17799'>'No; the murderer has escaped.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17800' title='17800'>Sherlock Holmes smiled demurely.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17801' title='17801'>'Your Grace can hardly have heard of any small reputation which I possess, or you would not imagine that it is so easy to escape me. </span>
<span sid='17802' title='17802'>Mr Reuben Hayes was arrested at Chesterfield on my information at eleven o'clock last night. </span>
<span sid='17803' title='17803'>I had a telegram from the head of the local police before I left the school this morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17804' title='17804'>The Duke leaned back in his chair and stared with amazement at my friend.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17805' title='17805'>'You seem to have powers that are hardly human,' said he. </span>
<span sid='17806' title='17806'>'So Reuben Hayes is taken? </span>
<span sid='17807' title='17807'>I am right glad to hear it, if it will not react upon the fate of James.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17808' title='17808'>'Your secretary?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17809' title='17809'>'No, sir; my son.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17810' title='17810'>It was Holmes's turn to look astonished.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17811' title='17811'>'I confess that this is entirely new to me, your Grace, I must beg of you to be more explicit.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17812' title='17812'>'I will conceal nothing from you. </span>
<span sid='17813' title='17813'>I agree with you that complete frankness, however painful it may be to me, is the best policy in this desperate situation to which James's folly and jealousy have reduced us. </span>
<span sid='17814' title='17814'>When I was a young man, Mr Holmes, I loved with such a love as comes only once in a lifetime. </span>
<span sid='17815' title='17815'>I offered the lady marriage, but she refused it on the grounds that such a match might mar my career. </span>
<span sid='17816' title='17816'>Had she lived, I would certainly have never married anyone else. </span>
<span sid='17817' title='17817'>She died, and left this one child, whom for her sake I have cherished and cared for. </span>
<span sid='17818' title='17818'>I could not acknowledge the paternity to the world; but I gave him the best of educations, and since he came to manhood I have kept him near my person. </span>
<span sid='17819' title='17819'>He surprised my secret, and has presumed ever since upon the claim which he has upon me and upon his power of provoking a scandal, which would be abhorrent to me. </span>
<span sid='17820' title='17820'>His presence had something to do with the unhappy issue of my marriage. </span>
<span sid='17821' title='17821'>Above all, he hated my young legitimate heir from the first with a persistent hatred. </span>
<span sid='17822' title='17822'>You may well ask me why, under these circumstances, I still kept James under my roof. </span>
<span sid='17823' title='17823'>I answer that it was because I could see his mother's face in his, and that for her dear sake there was no end to my long-suffering. </span>
<span sid='17824' title='17824'>All her pretty ways, too - there was not one of them which he could not suggest and bring back to my memory. </span>
<span sid='17825' title='17825'>I could not send him away. </span>
<span sid='17826' title='17826'>But I feared so lest he should do Arthur - that is, Lord Saltire - a mischief that I dispatched him for safety to Dr Huxtable's school.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17827' title='17827'>James came into contact with this fellow Hayes because the man was a tenant of mine, and James acted as agent. </span>
<span sid='17828' title='17828'>The fellow was a rascal from the beginning; but in some extraordinary way James became intimate with him. </span>
<span sid='17829' title='17829'>He had always a taste for low company. </span>
<span sid='17830' title='17830'>When James determined to kidnap Lord Saltire it was of this man's service that he availed himself. </span>
<span sid='17831' title='17831'>You remember that I wrote to Arthur upon that last day. </span>
<span sid='17832' title='17832'>Well, James opened the letter and inserted a note asking Arthur to meet him in a little wood called the Ragged Shaw which is near to the school. </span>
<span sid='17833' title='17833'>He used the Duchess's name, and in that way got the boy to come. </span>
<span sid='17834' title='17834'>That evening James cycled over - I am telling you what he has himself confessed to me - and he told Arthur, whom he met in the wood, that his mother longed to see him, that she was awaiting him on the moor, and that if he would come back into the wood at midnight he would find a man with a horse, who would take him to her. </span>
<span sid='17835' title='17835'>Poor Arthur fell into the trap. </span>
<span sid='17836' title='17836'>He came to the appointment and found this fellow Hayes with a led pony. </span>
<span sid='17837' title='17837'>Arthur mounted, and they set off together. </span>
<span sid='17838' title='17838'>It appears - though this James only heard yesterday - that they were pursued, that Hayes struck the pursuer with his stick, and that the man died of his injuries. </span>
<span sid='17839' title='17839'>Hayes brought Arthur to his public-house, the "Fighting Cock", where he was confined in an upper room, under the care of Mrs Hayes, who is a kindly woman, but entirely under the control of her brutal husband.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17840' title='17840'>'Well, Mr Holmes, that was the state of affairs when I first saw you two days ago. </span>
<span sid='17841' title='17841'>I had no more idea of the truth than you. </span>
<span sid='17842' title='17842'>You will ask me what was James's motive in doing such a deed. </span>
<span sid='17843' title='17843'>I answer that there was a great deal which was unreasoning and fanatical in the hatred which he bore my heir. </span>
<span sid='17844' title='17844'>In his view he himself should have been heir of all my estates, and he deeply resented those social laws which made it impossible. </span>
<span sid='17845' title='17845'>At the same time, he had a definite motive also. </span>
<span sid='17846' title='17846'>He was eager that I should break the entail, and he was of opinion that it lay in my power to do so. </span>
<span sid='17847' title='17847'>He intended to make a bargain with me - to restore Arthur if I would break the entail, and so make it possible for the estate to be left to him by will. </span>
<span sid='17848' title='17848'>He knew well that I should never willingly invoke the aid of the police against him. </span>
<span sid='17849' title='17849'>I say that he would have proposed such a bargain to me, but he did not actually do so, for events moved too quickly for him, and he had not time to put his plans into practice.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17850' title='17850'>'What brought all his wicked scheme to wreck was your discovery of this man Heidegger's dead body. </span>
<span sid='17851' title='17851'>James was seized with horror at the news. </span>
<span sid='17852' title='17852'>It came to us yesterday as we sat together in this study. </span>
<span sid='17853' title='17853'>Dr Huxtable had sent a telegram. </span>
<span sid='17854' title='17854'>James was so overwhelmed with grief and agitation that my suspicions, which had never been entirely absent, rose instantly to a certainty, and I taxed him with the deed. </span>
<span sid='17855' title='17855'>He made a complete voluntary confession. </span>
<span sid='17856' title='17856'>Then he implored me to keep his secret for three days longer, so as to give his wretched accomplice a chance of saving his guilty life. </span>
<span sid='17857' title='17857'>I yielded - as I have always yielded - to his prayers, and instantly James hurried off to the "Fighting Cock" to warn Hayes and give him the means of flight. </span>
<span sid='17858' title='17858'>I could not go there by daylight without provoking comment, but as soon as night fell I hurried off to see my dear Arthur. </span>
<span sid='17859' title='17859'>I found him safe and well, but horrified beyond expression by the dreadful deed he had witnessed. </span>
<span sid='17860' title='17860'>In deference to my promise, and much against my will, I consented to leave him there for three days under the charge of Mrs Hayes, since it was evident that it was impossible to inform the police where he was without telling them also who was the murderer, and I could not see how that murderer could be punished without ruin to my unfortunate James. </span>
<span sid='17861' title='17861'>You asked for frankness, Mr Holmes, and I have taken you at your word, for I have now told you everything without an attempt at circumlocution or concealment. </span>
<span sid='17862' title='17862'>Do you in your turn be as frank with me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17863' title='17863'>'I will,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='17864' title='17864'>In the first place, your Grace, I am bound to tell you that you have placed yourself in a most serious position in the eyes of the law. </span>
<span sid='17865' title='17865'>You have condoned a felony, and you have aided the escape of a murderer; for I cannot doubt that any money which was taken by James Wilder to aid his accomplice in his flight came from your Grace's purse.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17866' title='17866'>The Duke bowed his assent.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17867' title='17867'>This is indeed a most serious matter. </span>
<span sid='17868' title='17868'>Even more culpable, in my opinion, your Grace, is your attitude towards your younger son. </span>
<span sid='17869' title='17869'>You leave him in this den for three days.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17870' title='17870'>'Under solemn promises-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17871' title='17871'>'What are promises to such people as these? </span>
<span sid='17872' title='17872'>You have no guarantee that he will not be spirited away again. </span>
<span sid='17873' title='17873'>To humour your guilty elder son you have exposed your innocent younger son to imminent and unnecessary danger. </span>
<span sid='17874' title='17874'>It was a most unjustifiable action.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17875' title='17875'>The proud lord of Holdernesse was not accustomed to be so rated in his own ducal hall. </span>
<span sid='17876' title='17876'>The blood flushed into his high forehead, but his conscience held him dumb.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17877' title='17877'>'I will help you, but on one condition only. </span>
<span sid='17878' title='17878'>It is that you ring for the footman and let me give such orders as I like.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17879' title='17879'>Without a word the Duke pressed the electric button. </span>
<span sid='17880' title='17880'>A servant entered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17881' title='17881'>'You will be glad to hear', said Holmes, 'that your young master is found. </span>
<span sid='17882' title='17882'>It is the Duke's desire that the carriage shall go at once to the "Fighting Cock Inn" to bring Lord Saltire home.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17883' title='17883'>'Now,' said Holmes, when the rejoicing lackey had disappeared, 'having secured the future we can afford to be more lenient with the past. </span>
<span sid='17884' title='17884'>I am not in an official position, and there is no reason, so long as the ends of justice are served, why I should disclose all that I know. </span>
<span sid='17885' title='17885'>As to Hayes I say nothing. </span>
<span sid='17886' title='17886'>The gallows awaits him, and I would do nothing to save him from it. </span>
<span sid='17887' title='17887'>What he will divulge I cannot tell, but I have no doubt that your Grace could make him understand that it is to his interest to be silent. </span>
<span sid='17888' title='17888'>From the police point of view he will have kidnapped the boy for the purpose of ransom. </span>
<span sid='17889' title='17889'>If they do not themselves find it out I see no reason why I should prompt them to take a broader view. </span>
<span sid='17890' title='17890'>I would warn your Grace, however, that the continued presence of Mr James Wilder in your household can only lead to misfortune.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17891' title='17891'>'I understand that, Mr Holmes, and it is already settled that he shall leave me for ever and go to seek his fortune in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Australia&t=h'>Australia</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17892' title='17892'>'In that case, your Grace, since you have yourself stated that any unhappiness in your married life was caused by his presence, I would suggest that you make such amends as you can to the Duchess, and that you try to resume those relations which have been so unhappily interrupted.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17893' title='17893'>'That also I have arranged, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='17894' title='17894'>I wrote to the Duchess this morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17895' title='17895'>'In that case,' said Holmes, rising, think that my friend and I can congratulate ourselves upon several most happy results from our little visit to the North. </span>
<span sid='17896' title='17896'>There is one other small point upon which I desire some light. </span>
<span sid='17897' title='17897'>This fellow Hayes had shod his horses with shoes which counterfeited the tracks of cows. </span>
<span sid='17898' title='17898'>Was it from Mr Wilder that he learned so extraordinary a device?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17899' title='17899'>The Duke stood in thought for a moment, with a look of intense surprise on his face. </span>
<span sid='17900' title='17900'>Then he opened a door and showed us into a large room furnished as a museum. </span>
<span sid='17901' title='17901'>He led the way to a glass case in a corner, and pointed to the inscription.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17902' title='17902'>'These shoes', it ran, 'were dug up in the moat of Holdernesse Hall. </span>
<span sid='17903' title='17903'>They are for the use of horses; but they are shaped below with a cloven foot of iron, so as to throw pursuers off the track. </span>
<span sid='17904' title='17904'>They are supposed to have belonged to some of the marauding Barons of Holdernesse in the Middle Ages.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17905' title='17905'>Holmes opened the case, and, moistening his finger, he passed it along the shoe. </span>
<span sid='17906' title='17906'>A thin film of recent mud was left upon his skin.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17907' title='17907'>'Thank you,' said he, as he replaced the glass. </span>
<span sid='17908' title='17908'>It is the second most interesting object that I have seen in the North.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17909' title='17909'>'And the first?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17910' title='17910'>Holmes folded up his cheque, and placed it carefully in his note-book. </span>
<span sid='17911' title='17911'>'I am a poor man,' said he, as he patted it affectionately, and thrust it into the depths of his inner pocket.</span>
