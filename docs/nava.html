<p>
<span sid='13148' title='13148'>The July which immediately succeeded my marriage was made memorable by three cases of interest in which I had the privilege of being associated with Sherlock Holmes, and of studying his methods. </span>
<span sid='13149' title='13149'>I find them recorded in my notes under the headings of ' The Adventure of the Second Stain', ' The Adventure of the Naval Treaty', and ' The Adventure of the Tired Captain'. </span>
<span sid='13150' title='13150'>The first of these, however, deals with interests of such importance, and implicates so many of the first families in the kingdom, that for many years it will be impossible to make it public. </span>
<span sid='13151' title='13151'>No case, however, in which Holmes was ever engaged has illustrated the value of his analytical methods so clearly or has impressed those who were associated with him so deeply. </span>
<span sid='13152' title='13152'>I still retain an almost verbatim report of the interview in which he demonstrated the true facts of the case to Monsieur Dubuque, of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Paris&t=h'>Paris</a> Police, and Fritz von Waldbaum, the well-known specialist of Dantzig, both of whom had wasted their energies upon what proved to be side-issues. </span>
<span sid='13153' title='13153'>The new century will have come, however, before the story can be safely told. </span>
<span sid='13154' title='13154'>Meanwhile, I pass on to the second upon my list, which promised also, at one time, to be of national importance, and was marked by several incidents which give it a quite unique character.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13155' title='13155'>During my school-days I had been intimately associated with a lad named Percy Phelps, who was of much the same age as myself, though he was two classes ahead of me. </span>
<span sid='13156' title='13156'>He was a very brilliant boy, and carried away every prize which the school had to offer, finishing his exploits by winning a scholarship, which sent him on to continue his triumphant career at Cambridge. </span>
<span sid='13157' title='13157'>He was, I remember, extremely well connected and even when we were all little boys together, we knew that his mother's brother was Lord Holdhurst, the great Conservative politician. </span>
<span sid='13158' title='13158'>This gaudy relationship did him little good at school; on the contrary, it seemed rather a piquant thing to us to chevy him about the playground and hit him over the shins with a wicket. </span>
<span sid='13159' title='13159'>But it was another thing when he came out into the world. </span>
<span sid='13160' title='13160'>I heard vaguely that his abilities and the influence which he commanded had won him a good position at the Foreign Office, and then he passed completely out of my mind until the following letter recalled his existence:</span>
<p>
<span sid='13161' title='13161'>'BRIARBRAE, WOKING.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13162' title='13162'>'MY DEAR WATSON, - I have no doubt that you can remember "Tadpole" Phelps, who was in the fifth form when you were in the third. </span>
<span sid='13163' title='13163'>It is possible even that you may have heard that, through my uncle's influence, I obtained a good appointment at the Foreign Office, and that I was in a situation of trust and honour until a horrible misfortune came suddenly to blast my career.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13164' title='13164'>'There is no use writing the details of that dreadful event. </span>
<span sid='13165' title='13165'>In the event of your acceding to my request, it is probable that I shall have to narrate them to you. </span>
<span sid='13166' title='13166'>I have only just recovered from nine weeks of brain fever, and am still exceedingly weak. </span>
<span sid='13167' title='13167'>Do you think that you could bring your friend, Mr. Holmes, down to see me? </span>
<span sid='13168' title='13168'>I should like to have his opinion of the case, though the authorities assure me that nothing more can be done. </span>
<span sid='13169' title='13169'>Do try to bring him down, and as soon as possible. </span>
<span sid='13170' title='13170'>Every minute seems an hour while I live in this horrible suspense. </span>
<span sid='13171' title='13171'>Assure him that, if I have not asked his advice sooner, it was not because I did not appreciate his talents, but because I have been off my head ever since the blow fell. </span>
<span sid='13172' title='13172'>Now I am clear again, though I dare not think of it too much for fear of a relapse. </span>
<span sid='13173' title='13173'>I am still so weak that I have to write, as you see, by dictating. </span>
<span sid='13174' title='13174'>Do try and bring him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13175' title='13175'>'Your old schoolfellow,' </span>
<span sid='13176' title='13176'>PERCY PHELPS.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13177' title='13177'>There was something that touched me as I read this letter, something pitiable in the reiterated appeals to bring Holmes. </span>
<span sid='13178' title='13178'>So moved was I that, even if it had been a difficult matter, 'I should have tried it; but, of course, I knew well that Holmes loved his art so, that he was ever as ready to bring his aid as his client could be to receive it. </span>
<span sid='13179' title='13179'>My wife agreed with me that not a moment should be lost in laying the matter before him, and so, within an hour of breakfast-time, I found myself back once more in the old rooms in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13180' title='13180'>Holmes was seated at his side-table clad in his dressing-gown and working hard over a chemical investigation. </span>
<span sid='13181' title='13181'>A large curved retort was boiling furiously in the bluish flame of a Bunsen burner, and the distilled drops were condensing into a two-litre measure. </span>
<span sid='13182' title='13182'>My friend hardly glanced up as I entered, and I, seeing that his investigation must be of importance, seated myself in an arm-chair and waited. </span>
<span sid='13183' title='13183'>He dipped into this bottle or that, drawing out a few drops of each with his glass pipette, and finally brought a test-tube containing a solution over to the table. </span>
<span sid='13184' title='13184'>In his right hand he had a slip of litmus-paper.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13185' title='13185'>'You come at a crisis, Watson,' said he. </span>
<span sid='13186' title='13186'>'If this paper remains blue, all is well. </span>
<span sid='13187' title='13187'>If it turns red, it means a man's life.' </span>
<span sid='13188' title='13188'>He dipped it into the test-tube, and it flushed at once into a dull, dirty crimson. </span>
<span sid='13189' title='13189'>'Hum! </span>
<span sid='13190' title='13190'>I thought as much!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='13191' title='13191'>'I shall be at your service in one instant, Watson. </span>
<span sid='13192' title='13192'>You will find tobacco in the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Persia&t=h'>Persia</a>n slipper.' </span>
<span sid='13193' title='13193'>He turned to his desk and scribbled off several telegrams, which were handed over to the page-boy. </span>
<span sid='13194' title='13194'>Then he threw himself down in the chair opposite, and drew up his knees until his fingers clasped round his long, thin shins.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13195' title='13195'>'A very commonplace little murder,' said he. </span>
<span sid='13196' title='13196'>'You've got something better, I fancy. </span>
<span sid='13197' title='13197'>You are the stormy petrel of crime, Watson. </span>
<span sid='13198' title='13198'>What is it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13199' title='13199'>I handed him the letter, which he read with the most concentrated attention.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13200' title='13200'>'It does not tell us very much, does it?' he remarked, as he handed it back to me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13201' title='13201'>'Hardly anything.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13202' title='13202'>'And yet the writing is of interest.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13203' title='13203'>'But the writing is not his own.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13204' title='13204'>'Precisely. </span>
<span sid='13205' title='13205'>It is a woman's.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13206' title='13206'>'A man's surely!' I cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13207' title='13207'>'No, a woman's; and a woman of rare character. </span>
<span sid='13208' title='13208'>You see, at the commencement of an investigation, it is something to know that your client is in close contact with someone who for good or evil has an exceptional nature. </span>
<span sid='13209' title='13209'>My interest is already awakened in the case. </span>
<span sid='13210' title='13210'>If you are ready, we will start at once for Woking and see this diplomatist who is in such evil case, and the lady to whom he dictates his letters.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13211' title='13211'>We were fortunate enough to catch an early train at Waterloo, and in a little under an hour we found ourselves among the fir-woods and the heather of Woking. </span>
<span sid='13212' title='13212'>Briarbrae proved to be a large detached house standing in extensive grounds, within a few minutes' walk of the station. </span>
<span sid='13213' title='13213'>On sending in our cards we were shown into an elegantly appointed drawingroom, where we were joined in a few minutes by a rather stout man, who received us with much hospitality. </span>
<span sid='13214' title='13214'>His age may have been nearer forty than thirty, but his cheeks were so ruddy and his eyes so merry, that he still conveyed the impression of a plump and mischievous boy.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13215' title='13215'>'I am so glad that you have come,' said he, shaking our hands with effusion. </span>
<span sid='13216' title='13216'>'Percy has been inquiring for you all the morning. </span>
<span sid='13217' title='13217'>Ah, poor old chap, he clings to any straw. </span>
<span sid='13218' title='13218'>His father and mother asked me to see you, for the mere mention of the subject is very painful to them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13219' title='13219'>'We have had no details yet,' observed Holmes. </span>
<span sid='13220' title='13220'>'I perceive that you are not yourself a member of the family.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13221' title='13221'>Our acquaintance looked surprised, and then glancing down he began to laugh.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13222' title='13222'>'Of course you saw the "J. H." monogram on my locket,' said he. </span>
<span sid='13223' title='13223'>'For a moment I thought you had done something clever. </span>
<span sid='13224' title='13224'>Joseph Harrison is my name, and as Percy is to marry my sister Annie, I shall at least be a relation by marriage. </span>
<span sid='13225' title='13225'>You will find my sister in his room, for she has nursed him hand-and-foot these two months back. </span>
<span sid='13226' title='13226'>Perhaps we had better go in at once, for I know how impatient he is.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13227' title='13227'>The chamber into which we were shown was on the same floor as the drawing-room. </span>
<span sid='13228' title='13228'>It was furnished partly as a sitting- and partly as a bedroom, with flowers arranged daintily in every nook and corner. </span>
<span sid='13229' title='13229'>A young man, very pale and worn, was lying upon a sofa near the open window, through which came the rich scent of the garden and the balmy summer air. </span>
<span sid='13230' title='13230'>A woman was sitting beside him, and rose as we entered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13231' title='13231'>'Shall I leave, Percy?' she asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13232' title='13232'>He clutched her hand to detain her. </span>
<span sid='13233' title='13233'>'How are you, Watson?' said he, cordially. </span>
<span sid='13234' title='13234'>'I should never have known you under that moustache, and I daresay you would not be prepared to swear to me. </span>
<span sid='13235' title='13235'>This, I presume, is your celebrated friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13236' title='13236'>I introduced him in a few words, and we both sat down. </span>
<span sid='13237' title='13237'>The stout young man had left us, but his sister still remained, with her hand in that of the invalid. </span>
<span sid='13238' title='13238'>She was a striking-looking woman, a little short and thick for symmetry, but with a beautiful olive complexion, large, dark Italian eyes, and a wealth of deep black hair. </span>
<span sid='13239' title='13239'>Her rich tints made the white face of her companion the more worn and haggard by the contrast.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13240' title='13240'>'I won't waste your time,' said he, raising himself upon the sofa. </span>
<span sid='13241' title='13241'>'I'll plunge into the matter without further preamble. </span>
<span sid='13242' title='13242'>I was a happy and successful man, Mr. Holmes, and on the eve of being married, when a sudden and dreadful misfortune wrecked all my prospects in life.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13243' title='13243'>'I was, as Watson may have told you, in the Foreign Office, and through the influence of my uncle, Lord Holdhurst, I rose rapidly to a responsible position. </span>
<span sid='13244' title='13244'>When my uncle became Foreign Minister in this Administration he gave me several missions of trust, and as I always brought them to a successful conclusion, he came at last to have the utmost confidence in my ability and tact.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13245' title='13245'>'Nearly ten weeks ago - to be more accurate, on the 23rd of May - he called me into his private room and, after complimenting me upon the good work which I had done, informed me that he had a new commission of trust for me to execute.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13246' title='13246'>'"This," said he, taking a grey roll of paper from his bureau, "is the original of that secret treaty between <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> and <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Italy&t=h'>Italy</a>, of which, I regret to say, some rumours have already got into the public Press. </span>
<span sid='13247' title='13247'>It is of enormous importance that nothing further should leak out. </span>
<span sid='13248' title='13248'>The French or <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Russia&t=h'>Russia</a>n Embassies would pay an immense sum to learn the contents of these papers. </span>
<span sid='13249' title='13249'>They should not leave my bureau were it not that it is absolutely necessary to have them copied. </span>
<span sid='13250' title='13250'>You have a desk in your office?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='13251' title='13251'>'"Yes, sir."</span>
<p>
<span sid='13252' title='13252'>'"Then take the treaty and lock it up there. </span>
<span sid='13253' title='13253'>I shall give directions that you may remain behind when the others go, so that you may copy it at your leisure, without fear of being overlooked. </span>
<span sid='13254' title='13254'>When you have finished, re-lock both the original and the draft in the desk, and hand them over to me personally to-morrow morning."</span>
<p>
<span sid='13255' title='13255'>'I took the papers and-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13256' title='13256'>'Excuse me an instant,' said Holmes; 'were you alone during this conversation?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13257' title='13257'>'Absolutely.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13258' title='13258'>'In a large room?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13259' title='13259'>'Thirty feet each way.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13260' title='13260'>'In the centre?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13261' title='13261'>'Yes, about it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13262' title='13262'>'And speaking low?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13263' title='13263'>'My uncle's voice is always remarkably low. </span>
<span sid='13264' title='13264'>I hardly spoke at all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13265' title='13265'>'Thank you,' said Holmes, shutting his eyes; 'pray go on.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13266' title='13266'>'I did exactly what he had indicated, and waited until the other clerks had departed. </span>
<span sid='13267' title='13267'>One of them in my room, Charles Gorot, had some arrears of work to make up, so I left him there and went out to dine. </span>
<span sid='13268' title='13268'>When I returned he was gone. </span>
<span sid='13269' title='13269'>I was anxious to hurry my work, for I knew that Joseph, the Mr. Harrison whom you saw just now, was in town, and that he would travel down to Woking by the eleven o'clock train, and I wanted if possible to catch it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13270' title='13270'>'When I came to examine the treaty I saw at once that it was of such importance that my uncle had been guilty of no exaggeration in what he had said. </span>
<span sid='13271' title='13271'>Without going into details, I may say that it defined the position of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Great Britain&t=h'>Great Britain</a> towards the Triple Alliance, and foreshadowed the policy which this country would pursue in the event of the French fleet gaining a complete ascendency over that of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Italy&t=h'>Italy</a> in the Mediterranean. </span>
<span sid='13272' title='13272'>The questions treated in it were purely naval. </span>
<span sid='13273' title='13273'>At the end were the signatures of the high dignitaries who had signed it. </span>
<span sid='13274' title='13274'>I glanced my eyes over it, and then settled down to my task of copying.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13275' title='13275'>'It was a long document, written in the French language, and containing twenty-six separate articles. </span>
<span sid='13276' title='13276'>I copied as quickly as I could, but at nine o'clock I had only done nine articles, and it seemed hopeless for me to attempt to catch my train. </span>
<span sid='13277' title='13277'>I was feeling drowsy and stupid, partly from my dinner and also from the effects of a long day's work. </span>
<span sid='13278' title='13278'>A cup of coffee would clear my brain. </span>
<span sid='13279' title='13279'>A commissionaire remains all night in a little lodge at the foot of the stairs, and is in the habit of making coffee at his spirit-lamp for any of the officials who may be working overtime. </span>
<span sid='13280' title='13280'>I rang the bell, therefore, to summon him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13281' title='13281'>'To my surprise, it was a woman who answered the summons, a large, coarse-faced, elderly woman, in an apron. </span>
<span sid='13282' title='13282'>She explained that she was the commissionaire's wife, who did the charing, and I gave her the order for the coffee.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13283' title='13283'>'I wrote two more articles, and then, feeling more drowsy than ever, I rose and walked up and down the room to stretch my legs. </span>
<span sid='13284' title='13284'>My coffee had not yet come, and I wondered what the cause of the delay could be. </span>
<span sid='13285' title='13285'>Opening the door, I started down the corridor to find out. </span>
<span sid='13286' title='13286'>There was a straight passage dimly lit which led from the room in which I had been working, and was the only exit from it. </span>
<span sid='13287' title='13287'>It ended in a curving staircase, with the commissionaire's lodge in the passage at the bottom. </span>
<span sid='13288' title='13288'>Half-way down this staircase is a small landing, with another passage running into it at right angles. </span>
<span sid='13289' title='13289'>The second one leads, by means of a second small stair, to a side-door used by servants, and also as a short cut by clerks when coming from Charles Street.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13290' title='13290'>'Here is a rough chart of the place.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13291' title='13291'>'Thank you. </span>
<span sid='13292' title='13292'>I think that I quite follow you,' said Sherlock Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13293' title='13293'>'It is of the utmost importance that you should notice this point. </span>
<span sid='13294' title='13294'>I went down the stairs and into the hall, where I found the commissionaire fast asleep in his box, with the kettle boiling furiously upon the spirit-lamp, for the water was spurting over the floor. </span>
<span sid='13295' title='13295'>I had put out my hand and was about to shake the man, who was still sleeping soundly, when a bell over his head rang loudly, and he woke with a start.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13296' title='13296'>'"Mr. Phelps, sir I" said he, looking at me in bewilderment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13297' title='13297'>'"I came down to see if my coffee was ready."</span>
<p>
<span sid='13298' title='13298'>'"I was boiling the kettle when I fell asleep, sir."</span>
<p>
<span sid='13299' title='13299'>He looked at me and then up at the still quivering bell, with an ever-growing astonishment upon his face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13300' title='13300'>'"If you was here, sir, then who rang the bell?" he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13301' title='13301'>'"The bell!" I said. </span>
<span sid='13302' title='13302'>"What bell is it?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='13303' title='13303'>'"It's the bell of the room you were working in."</span>
<p>
<span sid='13304' title='13304'>'A cold hand seemed to close round my heart. </span>
<span sid='13305' title='13305'>Someone, then, was in that room where my precious treaty lay upon the table. </span>
<span sid='13306' title='13306'>I ran frantically up the stairs and along the passage. </span>
<span sid='13307' title='13307'>There was no one in the corridor, Mr. Holmes. </span>
<span sid='13308' title='13308'>There was no one in the room. </span>
<span sid='13309' title='13309'>All was exactly as I left it, save only that the papers committed to my care had been taken from the desk on which they lay. </span>
<span sid='13310' title='13310'>The copy was there and the original was gone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13311' title='13311'>Holmes sat up in his chair and rubbed his hands. </span>
<span sid='13312' title='13312'>I could see that the problem was entirely to his heart. </span>
<span sid='13313' title='13313'>'Pray, what did you do then?' he murmured.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13314' title='13314'>'I recognized in an instant that the thief must have come up the stairs from the side-door. </span>
<span sid='13315' title='13315'>Of course I must have met him if he had come the other way.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13316' title='13316'>'You were satisfied that he could not have been concealed in the room all the time, or in the corridor which you have just described as dimly lighted?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13317' title='13317'>'It is absolutely impossible. </span>
<span sid='13318' title='13318'>A rat could not conceal himself either in the room or the corridor. </span>
<span sid='13319' title='13319'>There is no cover at all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13320' title='13320'>'Thank you. </span>
<span sid='13321' title='13321'>Pray proceed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13322' title='13322'>'The commissionaire, seeing by my pale face that something was to be feared, had followed me upstairs. </span>
<span sid='13323' title='13323'>Now we both rushed along the corridor and down the steep steps which led to Charles Street. </span>
<span sid='13324' title='13324'>The door at the bottom was closed but unlocked. </span>
<span sid='13325' title='13325'>We flung it open and rushed out. </span>
<span sid='13326' title='13326'>I can distinctly remember that as we did so there came three chimes from a neighbouring church. </span>
<span sid='13327' title='13327'>It was a quarter to ten.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13328' title='13328'>'That is of enormous importance,' said Holmes, making a note upon his shirt cuff.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13329' title='13329'>'The night was very dark, and a thin, warm rain was falling. </span>
<span sid='13330' title='13330'>There was no one in Charles Street, but a great traffic was going on, as usual, in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Whitehall&t=h'>Whitehall</a>, at the extremity. </span>
<span sid='13331' title='13331'>We rushed along the pavement, bareheaded as we were, and at the far corner we found a policeman standing.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13332' title='13332'>'"A robbery has been committed," I gasped. </span>
<span sid='13333' title='13333'>"A document of immense value has been stolen from the Foreign Office. </span>
<span sid='13334' title='13334'>Has anyone passed this way?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13335' title='13335'>'"I have been standing here for a quarter of an hour, sir," said he; "only one person has passed during that time - a woman, tall and elderly, with a Paisley shawl."</span>
<p>
<span sid='13336' title='13336'>'"Ah, that is only my wife," cried the commissionaire. </span>
<span sid='13337' title='13337'>"Has no one else passed?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='13338' title='13338'>'"No one."</span>
<p>
<span sid='13339' title='13339'>'"Then it must be the other way that the thief took," cried the fellow, tugging at my sleeve.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13340' title='13340'>'But I was not satisfied, and the attempts which he made to draw me away increased my suspicions.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13341' title='13341'>'"Which way did the woman go?" I cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13342' title='13342'>'"I don't know, sir. </span>
<span sid='13343' title='13343'>I noticed her pass, but I had no special reason for watching her. </span>
<span sid='13344' title='13344'>She seemed to be in a hurry."</span>
<p>
<span sid='13345' title='13345'>'"How long ago was it?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='13346' title='13346'>'"Oh, not very many minutes."</span>
<p>
<span sid='13347' title='13347'>'"Within the last five?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='13348' title='13348'>'"Well, it could not be more than five."</span>
<p>
<span sid='13349' title='13349'>'"You're only wasting your time, sir, and every minute now is of importance," cried the commissionaire. </span>
<span sid='13350' title='13350'>"Take my word for it that my old woman has nothing to do with it, and come down to the other end of the street. </span>
<span sid='13351' title='13351'>Well, if you won't, I will," and with that he rushed off in the other direction.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13352' title='13352'>'But I was after him in an instant and caught him by the sleeve.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13353' title='13353'>'"Where do you live?" said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13354' title='13354'>'" No. 16 Ivy Lane, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a>," he answered; "but don't let yourself be drawn away upon a false scent, Mr. Phelps. </span>
<span sid='13355' title='13355'>Come to the other end of the street, and let us see if we can hear of anything."</span>
<p>
<span sid='13356' title='13356'>'Nothing was to be lost by following his advice. </span>
<span sid='13357' title='13357'>With the policeman we both hurried down, but only to find the street full of traffic, many people coming and going, but all only too eager to get to a place of safety upon so wet a night. </span>
<span sid='13358' title='13358'>There was no lounger who could tell us who had passed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13359' title='13359'>'Then we returned to the office, and searched the stairs and the passage without result. </span>
<span sid='13360' title='13360'>The corridor which led to the room was laid down with a kind of creamy linoleum, which shows an impression very easily. </span>
<span sid='13361' title='13361'>We examined it very carefully, but found no outline of any footmark.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13362' title='13362'>'Had it been raining all the evening?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13363' title='13363'>'Since about seven.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13364' title='13364'>'How is it, then, that the woman who came into the room about nine left no traces with her muddy boots?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13365' title='13365'>'I am glad you raise the point. </span>
<span sid='13366' title='13366'>It occurred to me at the time. </span>
<span sid='13367' title='13367'>The charwomen are in the habit of taking off their boots at the commissionaire's office, and putting on list slippers.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13368' title='13368'>'That is very clear. </span>
<span sid='13369' title='13369'>There were no marks, then, though the night was a wet one? </span>
<span sid='13370' title='13370'>The chain of events is certainly one of extraordinary interest. </span>
<span sid='13371' title='13371'>What did you do next?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13372' title='13372'>'We examined the room also. </span>
<span sid='13373' title='13373'>There was no possibility of a secret door, and the windows are quite thirty feet from the ground. </span>
<span sid='13374' title='13374'>Both of them were fastened on the inside. </span>
<span sid='13375' title='13375'>The carpet prevents any possibility of a trap-door, and the ceiling is of the ordinary whitewashed kind. </span>
<span sid='13376' title='13376'>I will pledge my life that whoever stole my papers could only have come through the door.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13377' title='13377'>'How about the fireplace?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13378' title='13378'>'They use none There is a stove. </span>
<span sid='13379' title='13379'>The bell-rope hangs from the wire just to the right of my desk. </span>
<span sid='13380' title='13380'>Whoever rang it must have come right up to the desk to do it. </span>
<span sid='13381' title='13381'>But why should any criminal wish to ring the bell? </span>
<span sid='13382' title='13382'>It is a most insoluble mystery.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13383' title='13383'>'Certainly the incident was unusual. </span>
<span sid='13384' title='13384'>What were your next steps? </span>
<span sid='13385' title='13385'>You examined the room, I presume, to see if the intruder had left any traces - any cigar-end, or dropped glove, or hairpin, or other trifle?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13386' title='13386'>'There was nothing of the sort.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13387' title='13387'>'No smell?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13388' title='13388'>'Well, we never thought of that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13389' title='13389'>'Ah, a scent of tobacco would have been worth a great deal to us in such an investigation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13390' title='13390'>'I never smoke myself, so I think I should have observed it if there had been any smell of tobacco. </span>
<span sid='13391' title='13391'>There was absolutely no clue of any kind. </span>
<span sid='13392' title='13392'>The only tangible fact was that the commissionaire's wife - Mrs. Tangey was the name - had hurried out of the place. </span>
<span sid='13393' title='13393'>He could give no explanation save that it was about the time when the woman always went home. </span>
<span sid='13394' title='13394'>The policeman and I agreed that our best plan would be to seize the woman before she could get rid of the papers, presuming that she had them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13395' title='13395'>'The alarm had reached <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a> by this time, and Mr. Forbes, the detective, came round at once and took up the case with a great deal of energy. </span>
<span sid='13396' title='13396'>We hired a hansom, and in half an hour we were at the address which had been given to us. </span>
<span sid='13397' title='13397'>A young woman opened the door, who proved to be Mrs. Tangey's eldest daughter. </span>
<span sid='13398' title='13398'>Her mother had not come back yet, and we were shown into the front room to wait.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13399' title='13399'>'About ten minutes later a knock came at the door, and here we made the one serious mistake for which I blame myself. </span>
<span sid='13400' title='13400'>Instead of opening the door ourselves we allowed the girl to do so. </span>
<span sid='13401' title='13401'>We heard her say, "Mother, there are two men in the house waiting to see you," and an instant afterwards we heard the patter of feet rushing down the passage. </span>
<span sid='13402' title='13402'>Forbes flung open the door, and we both ran into the back room or kitchen, but the woman had got there before us. </span>
<span sid='13403' title='13403'>She stared at us with defiant eyes, and then suddenly recognizing me, an expression of absolute astonishment came over her face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13404' title='13404'>'"Why, if it isn't Mr. Phelps, of the office!" she cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13405' title='13405'>'"Come, come, who did you think we were when you ran away from us?" asked my companion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13406' title='13406'>'"I thought you were the brokers," said she. </span>
<span sid='13407' title='13407'>"We've had some trouble with a tradesman."</span>
<p>
<span sid='13408' title='13408'>'"That's not quite good enough," answered Forbes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13409' title='13409'>"We have reason to believe that you have taken a paper of importance from the Foreign Office, and that you ran in here to dispose of it. </span>
<span sid='13410' title='13410'>You must come back with us to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a> to be searched."</span>
<p>
<span sid='13411' title='13411'>'It was in vain that she protested and resisted. </span>
<span sid='13412' title='13412'>A four-wheeler was brought, and we all three drove back in it. </span>
<span sid='13413' title='13413'>We had first made an examination of the kitchen, and especially of the kitchen fire, to see whether she might have made away with the papers during the instant that she was alone. </span>
<span sid='13414' title='13414'>There were no signs, however, of any ashes or scraps. </span>
<span sid='13415' title='13415'>When we reached <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a> she was handed over at once to the female searcher. </span>
<span sid='13416' title='13416'>I waited in an agony of suspense until she came back with her report. </span>
<span sid='13417' title='13417'>There were no signs of the papers.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13418' title='13418'>'Then, for the first time, the horror of my situation came in its full force upon me. </span>
<span sid='13419' title='13419'>Hitherto I had been acting, and action had numbed thought. </span>
<span sid='13420' title='13420'>I had been so confident of regaining the treaty at once that I had not dared to think of what would be the consequence if I failed to do so. </span>
<span sid='13421' title='13421'>But now there was nothing more to be done, and I had leisure to realize my position. </span>
<span sid='13422' title='13422'>It was horrible! </span>
<span sid='13423' title='13423'>Watson there would tell you that I was a nervous, sensitive boy at school. </span>
<span sid='13424' title='13424'>It is my nature. </span>
<span sid='13425' title='13425'>I thought of my uncle and of his colleagues in the Cabinet, of the shame which I had brought upon him, upon myself, upon everyone connected with me. </span>
<span sid='13426' title='13426'>What though I was the victim of an extraordinary accident? </span>
<span sid='13427' title='13427'>No allowance is made for accidents where diplomatic interests are at stake. </span>
<span sid='13428' title='13428'>I was ruined; shamefully, hopelessly ruined. </span>
<span sid='13429' title='13429'>I don't know what I did. </span>
<span sid='13430' title='13430'>I fancy I must have made a scene. </span>
<span sid='13431' title='13431'>I have a dim recollection of a group of officials who crowded round me endeavouring to soothe me. </span>
<span sid='13432' title='13432'>One of them drove down with me to Waterloo and saw me into the Woking train. </span>
<span sid='13433' title='13433'>I believe that he would have come all the way had it not been that Dr. Ferrier, who lives near me, was going down by that very train. </span>
<span sid='13434' title='13434'>The doctor most kindly took charge of me, and it was well he did so, for I had a fit in the station, and before we reached home I was practically a raving maniac.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13435' title='13435'>'You can imagine the state of things here when they were roused from their beds by the doctor's ringing, and found me in this condition. </span>
<span sid='13436' title='13436'>Poor Annie here and my mother were broken-hearted. </span>
<span sid='13437' title='13437'>Dr. Ferrier had just heard enough from the detective at the station to be able to give an idea of what had happened, and his story did not mend matters. </span>
<span sid='13438' title='13438'>It was evident to all that I was in for a long illness, so Joseph was bundled out of this cheery bedroom, and it was turned into a sickroom for me. </span>
<span sid='13439' title='13439'>Here I have lain, Mr. Holmes, for over nine weeks, unconscious, and raving with brain fever. </span>
<span sid='13440' title='13440'>If it had not been for Miss Harrison here and for the doctor's care I should not be speaking to you now. </span>
<span sid='13441' title='13441'>She has nursed me by day, and a hired nurse has looked after me by night, for in my mad fits I was capable of anything. </span>
<span sid='13442' title='13442'>Slowly my reason has cleared, but it is only during the last three days that my memory has quite returned. </span>
<span sid='13443' title='13443'>Sometimes I wish that it never had. </span>
<span sid='13444' title='13444'>The first thing I did was to wire to Mr. Forbes, who had the case in hand. </span>
<span sid='13445' title='13445'>He came out and assured me that, though everything has been done, no trace of a clue has been discovered. </span>
<span sid='13446' title='13446'>The commissionaire and his wife have been examined in every way without any light being thrown upon the matter. </span>
<span sid='13447' title='13447'>The suspicions of the police then rested upon young Gorot, who, as you may remember, stayed overtime in the office that night. </span>
<span sid='13448' title='13448'>His remaining behind and his French name were really the only two points which could suggest suspicion; but as a matter of fact, I did not begin work until he had gone, and his people are of Huguenot extraction, but as English in sympathy and tradition as you and I are. </span>
<span sid='13449' title='13449'>Nothing was found to implicate him in any way, and there the matter dropped. </span>
<span sid='13450' title='13450'>I turn to you, Mr. Holmes, as absolutely my last hope. </span>
<span sid='13451' title='13451'>If you fail me, then my honour as well as my position are for ever forfeited.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13452' title='13452'>The invalid sank back upon his cushions, tired out by this long recital, while his nurse poured him out a glass of some stimulating medicine. </span>
<span sid='13453' title='13453'>Holmes sat silently with his head thrown back and his eyes closed in an attitude which might seem listless to a stranger, but which I knew betokened the most intense absorption.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13454' title='13454'>'Your statement has been so explicit,' said he at last, 'that you have really left me very few questions to ask. </span>
<span sid='13455' title='13455'>There is one of the very utmost importance, however. </span>
<span sid='13456' title='13456'>Did you tell anyone that you had this special task to perform?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13457' title='13457'>'No one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13458' title='13458'>'Not Miss Harrison here, for example?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13459' title='13459'>'No. </span>
<span sid='13460' title='13460'>I had not been back to Woking between getting the order and executing the commission.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13461' title='13461'>'And none of your people had by chance been to see you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13462' title='13462'>'None.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13463' title='13463'>'Did any of them know their way about in the office?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13464' title='13464'>'Oh, yes; all of them had been shown over it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13465' title='13465'>'Still, of course, if you said nothing to anyone about the treaty, these inquiries are irrelevant.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13466' title='13466'>'I said nothing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13467' title='13467'>'Do you know anything of the commissionaire?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13468' title='13468'>'Nothing, except that he is an old soldier.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13469' title='13469'>'What regiment?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13470' title='13470'>'Oh, I have heard - Coldstream Guards.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13471' title='13471'>'Thank you. </span>
<span sid='13472' title='13472'>I have no doubt I can get details from Forbes. </span>
<span sid='13473' title='13473'>The authorities are excellent at amassing facts, though they do not always use them to advantage. </span>
<span sid='13474' title='13474'>What a lovely thing a rose is!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13475' title='13475'>He walked past the couch to the open window, and held up the drooping stalk of a moss rose, looking down at the dainty blend of crimson and green. </span>
<span sid='13476' title='13476'>It was a new phase of his character to me, for I had never  before seen him show any keen interest in natural objects.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13477' title='13477'>'There is nothing in which deduction is so necessary as in religion,' said he, leaning with his back against the shutters. </span>
<span sid='13478' title='13478'>'It can be built up as an exact science by the reasoner. </span>
<span sid='13479' title='13479'>Our highest assurance of the goodness of Providence seems to me to rest in the flowers. </span>
<span sid='13480' title='13480'>All other things, our powers, our desires, our food, are really necessary for our existence in the first instance. </span>
<span sid='13481' title='13481'>But this rose is an extra. </span>
<span sid='13482' title='13482'>Its smell and its colour are an embellishment of life, not a condition of it. </span>
<span sid='13483' title='13483'>It is only goodness which gives extras, and so I say again that we have much to hope from the flowers.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13484' title='13484'>Percy Phelps and his nurse looked at Holmes during this demonstration with surprise and a good deal of disappointment written upon their faces. </span>
<span sid='13485' title='13485'>He had fallen into a reverie, with the moss rose between his fingers. </span>
<span sid='13486' title='13486'>It had lasted some minutes before the young lady broke in upon it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13487' title='13487'>'Do you see any prospect of solving this mystery, Mr. Holmes?' she asked, with a touch of asperity in her voice.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13488' title='13488'>'Oh, the mystery!' he answered, coming back with a start to the realities of life. </span>
<span sid='13489' title='13489'>'Well, it would be absurd to deny that the case is a very abstruse and complicated one; but I can promise you that I will look into the matter and let you know any points which may strike me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13490' title='13490'>'Do you see any clue?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13491' title='13491'>'You have furnished me with seven, but of course I must test them before I can pronounce upon their value.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13492' title='13492'>'You suspect someone?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13493' title='13493'>'I suspect myself-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13494' title='13494'>'What?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13495' title='13495'>'Of coming to conclusions too rapidly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13496' title='13496'>'Then go to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> and test your conclusions!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13497' title='13497'>'Your advice is very excellent, Miss Harrison,' said Holmes, rising. </span>
<span sid='13498' title='13498'>'I think, Watson, we cannot do better. </span>
<span sid='13499' title='13499'>Do not allow yourself to indulge in false hopes, Mr. Phelps. </span>
<span sid='13500' title='13500'>The affair is a very tangled one!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13501' title='13501'>'I shall be in a fever until I see you again,' cried the diplomatist.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13502' title='13502'>'Well, I'll come out by the same train to-morrow, though it's more than likely that my report will be a negative one!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13503' title='13503'>'God bless you for promising to come,' cried our client. </span>
<span sid='13504' title='13504'>'It gives me fresh life to know that something is being done. </span>
<span sid='13505' title='13505'>By the way, I have had a letter from Lord Holdhurst.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13506' title='13506'>'Ha! </span>
<span sid='13507' title='13507'>What did he say?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13508' title='13508'>'He was cold, but not harsh. </span>
<span sid='13509' title='13509'>I dare say my severe illness prevented him from being that. </span>
<span sid='13510' title='13510'>He repeated that the matter was of the utmost importance, and added that no steps would be taken about my future - by which he means, of course, my dismissal - until my health was restored and I had an opportunity of repairing my misfortune.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13511' title='13511'>'Well, that was reasonable and considerate,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='13512' title='13512'>'Come, Watson, for we have a good day's work before us in town.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13513' title='13513'>Mr. Joseph Harrison drove us down to the station, and we were soon whirling up in a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Portsmouth&t=h'>Portsmouth</a> train. </span>
<span sid='13514' title='13514'>Holmes was sunk in profound thought, and hardly opened his mouth until we had passed <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Clapham Junction&t=h'>Clapham Junction</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13515' title='13515'>'It's a very cheering thing to come into <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> by any of these lines which run high and allow you to look down upon the houses like this.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13516' title='13516'>I thought he was joking, for the view was sordid enough, but he soon explained himself.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13517' title='13517'>'Look at those big, isolated clumps of buildings rising up above the states, like brick islands in a leadcoloured sea.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13518' title='13518'>'The Board schools.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13519' title='13519'>'Lighthouses, my boy! </span>
<span sid='13520' title='13520'>Beacons of the future! </span>
<span sid='13521' title='13521'>Capsules, with hundreds of bright little seeds in each, out of which will spring the wiser, better <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> of the future. </span>
<span sid='13522' title='13522'>I suppose that man Phelps does not drink?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13523' title='13523'>'I should not think so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13524' title='13524'>'Nor should I. </span>
<span sid='13525' title='13525'>But we are bound to take every possibility into account. </span>
<span sid='13526' title='13526'>The poor devil has certainly got himself into very deep water, and it's a question whether we shall ever be able to get him ashore. </span>
<span sid='13527' title='13527'>What did you think of Miss Harrison?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13528' title='13528'>'A girl of strong character.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13529' title='13529'>'Yes, but she is a good sort, or I am mistaken. </span>
<span sid='13530' title='13530'>She and her brother are the only children of an iron-master somewhere up Northumberland way. </span>
<span sid='13531' title='13531'>Phelps got engaged to her when travelling last winter, and she came down to be introduced to his people, with her brother as escort. </span>
<span sid='13532' title='13532'>Then came the smash, and she stayed on to nurse her lover, while brother Joseph, finding himself pretty snug, stayed on too. </span>
<span sid='13533' title='13533'>I've been making a few independent inquiries, you see. </span>
<span sid='13534' title='13534'>But today must be a day of inquiries.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13535' title='13535'>'My practice-' I began.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13536' title='13536'>'Oh, if you find your own cases more interesting than mine-' said Holmes, with some asperity.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13537' title='13537'>'I was going to say that my practice could get along very well for a day or two, since it is the slackest time in the year.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13538' title='13538'>'Excellent,' said he, recovering his good humour.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13539' title='13539'>'Then we'll look into this matter together. </span>
<span sid='13540' title='13540'>I think that we should begin by seeing Forbes. </span>
<span sid='13541' title='13541'>He can probably tell us all the details we want, until we know from what side the case is to be approached.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13542' title='13542'>'You said you had a clue.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13543' title='13543'>'Well, we have several, but we can only test their value by further inquiry. </span>
<span sid='13544' title='13544'>The most difficult crime to track is the one which is purposeless. </span>
<span sid='13545' title='13545'>Now, this is not purposeless. </span>
<span sid='13546' title='13546'>Who is it that profits by it? </span>
<span sid='13547' title='13547'>There is the French Ambassador, there is the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Russia&t=h'>Russia</a>n, there is whoever might sell it to either of these, and there is Lord Holdhurst.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13548' title='13548'>'Lord Holdhurst!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13549' title='13549'>'Well, it is just conceivable that a statesman might find himself in a position where he was not sorry to have such a document accidentally destroyed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13550' title='13550'>'Not a statesman with the honourable record of Lord Holdhurst.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13551' title='13551'>'It is a possibility, and we cannot afford to disregard it. </span>
<span sid='13552' title='13552'>We shall see the noble lord to-day, and find out if he can tell us anything. </span>
<span sid='13553' title='13553'>Meanwhile, I have already set inquiries upon foot.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13554' title='13554'>'Already?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13555' title='13555'>'Yes, I sent wires from Woking station to every evening paper in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='13556' title='13556'>This advertisement will appear in each of them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13557' title='13557'>He handed over a sheet torn from the notebook. </span>
<span sid='13558' title='13558'>On it was scribbled in pencil:</span>
<p>
<span sid='13559' title='13559'>'Â£10 Reward. </span>
<span sid='13560' title='13560'>- The number of the cab which dropped a fare at or about the door of the Foreign Office in Charles Street, at a quarter to ten in the evening of May 23rd. </span>
<span sid='13561' title='13561'>Apply 221B <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13562' title='13562'>'You are confident that the thief came in a cab?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13563' title='13563'>'If not, there is no harm done. </span>
<span sid='13564' title='13564'>But if Mr. Phelps is correct in stating that there is no hiding-place either in the room or the corridors, then the person must have come from outside. </span>
<span sid='13565' title='13565'>If he came from outside on so wet a night, and yet left no trace of damp upon the linoleum, which was examined within a few minutes of his passing, then it is exceedingly probable that he came in a cab. </span>
<span sid='13566' title='13566'>Yes, I think that we may safely deduce a cab.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13567' title='13567'>'It sounds plausible.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13568' title='13568'>'That is one of the clues of which I spoke. </span>
<span sid='13569' title='13569'>It may lead us to something. </span>
<span sid='13570' title='13570'>And then, of course, there is the bell - which is the most distinctive feature of the case. </span>
<span sid='13571' title='13571'>Why should the bell ring? </span>
<span sid='13572' title='13572'>Was it the thief that did it out of bravado? </span>
<span sid='13573' title='13573'>Or was it someone who was with the thief who did it in order to prevent the crime? </span>
<span sid='13574' title='13574'>Or was it an accident? </span>
<span sid='13575' title='13575'>Or was it-?' </span>
<span sid='13576' title='13576'>He sank back into the state of intense and silent thought from which he had emerged, but it seemed to me, accustomed as I was to his every mood, that some new possibility had dawned suddenly upon him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13577' title='13577'>It was twenty-past three when we reached our terminus, and after a hasty luncheon at the buffet we pushed on at once to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>. </span>
<span sid='13578' title='13578'>Holmes had already wired to Forbes, and we found him waiting to receive us: a small, foxy man, with a sharp but by no means amiable expression. </span>
<span sid='13579' title='13579'>He was decidedly frigid in his manner to us, especially when he heard the errand upon which we had come.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13580' title='13580'>'I've heard of your methods before now, Mr. Holmes,' said he, tartly. </span>
<span sid='13581' title='13581'>'You are ready enough to use all the information that the police can lay at your disposal, and then you try to finish the case yourself and bring discredit upon them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13582' title='13582'>'On the contrary,' said Holmes; 'out of my last fifty-three cases my name has only appeared in four, and the police have had all the credit in forty-nine.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13583' title='13583'>I don't blame you for not knowing this; for you are young and inexperienced; but if you wished to get on in your new duties you will work with me, and not against me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13584' title='13584'>'I'd be very glad of a hint or two,' said the detective, changing his manner. </span>
<span sid='13585' title='13585'>'I've certainly had no credit from the case so far.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13586' title='13586'>'What steps have you taken?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13587' title='13587'>'Tangey, the commissionaire, has been shadowed. </span>
<span sid='13588' title='13588'>He left the Guards with a good character, and we can find nothing against him. </span>
<span sid='13589' title='13589'>His wife is a bad lot, though. </span>
<span sid='13590' title='13590'>I fancy she knows more about this than appears.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13591' title='13591'>'Have you shadowed her?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13592' title='13592'>'We have set one of our women on to her. </span>
<span sid='13593' title='13593'>Mrs. Tangey drinks, and our woman has been with her twice when she was well on, but she could get nothing out of her.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13594' title='13594'>'I understand that they have had brokers in the house?</span>
<p>
<span sid='13595' title='13595'>Yes, but they were paid off.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13596' title='13596'>'Where did the money come from?</span>
<p>
<span sid='13597' title='13597'>'That was all right. </span>
<span sid='13598' title='13598'>His pension was due; they have not shown any sign of being in funds.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13599' title='13599'>'What explanation did she give of having answered the bell when Mr. Phelps rang for the coffee?</span>
<p>
<span sid='13600' title='13600'>'She said that her husband was very tired and she wished to relieve him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13601' title='13601'>'Well, certainly that would agree with his being found, a little later, asleep in his chair. </span>
<span sid='13602' title='13602'>There is nothing against them, then, but the woman's character. </span>
<span sid='13603' title='13603'>Did you ask her why she hurried away that night? </span>
<span sid='13604' title='13604'>Her haste attracted the attention of the police-constable.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13605' title='13605'>'She was later than usual, and wanted to get home.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13606' title='13606'>'Did you point out to her that you and Mr. Phelps, who started at least twenty minutes after her, got there before her?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13607' title='13607'>'She explains that by the difference between a 'bus and a hansom.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13608' title='13608'>'Did she make it clear why, on reaching her house, she ran into the back kitchen?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13609' title='13609'>'Because she had the money there with which to pay off the brokers.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13610' title='13610'>'She has at least an answer for everything. </span>
<span sid='13611' title='13611'>Did you ask her whether in leaving she met anyone or saw anyone loitering about Charles Street?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13612' title='13612'>'She saw no one but the constable.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13613' title='13613'>'Well, you seem to have cross-examined her pretty thoroughly. </span>
<span sid='13614' title='13614'>What else have you done?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13615' title='13615'>'The clerk, Gorot, has been shadowed all these nine weeks, but without result. </span>
<span sid='13616' title='13616'>We can show nothing against him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13617' title='13617'>'Anything else?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13618' title='13618'>'Well, we have nothing else to go upon - no evidence of any kind.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13619' title='13619'>'Have you formed any theory about how that bell rang?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13620' title='13620'>'Well, I must confess that it beats me. </span>
<span sid='13621' title='13621'>It was a cool hand, whoever it was, to go and give the alarm like that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13622' title='13622'>'Yes, it was a queer thing to do. </span>
<span sid='13623' title='13623'>Many thanks to you for what you have told me. </span>
<span sid='13624' title='13624'>If I can put the man into your hands you shall hear from me. </span>
<span sid='13625' title='13625'>Come along, Watson!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13626' title='13626'>'Where are we going to now?' I asked, as we left the office.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13627' title='13627'>'We are now going to interview Lord Holdhurst, the Cabinet Minister and future Premier of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13628' title='13628'>We were fortunate in finding that Lord Holdhurst was still in his chambers at Downing Street, and on Holmes sending in his card we were instantly shown up. </span>
<span sid='13629' title='13629'>The statesman received us with that old-fashioned courtesy for which he is remarkable, and seated us on the two luxurious easy chairs on either side of the fireplace. </span>
<span sid='13630' title='13630'>Standing on the rug between us, with his slight, tall figure, his sharp-featured, thoughtful face, and his curling hair prematurely tinged with grey, he seemed to represent that not too common type, a nobleman who is in truth noble.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13631' title='13631'>'Your name is very familiar to me, Mr. Holmes,' said he, smiling. </span>
<span sid='13632' title='13632'>'And, of course, I cannot pretend to be ignorant of the object of your visit. </span>
<span sid='13633' title='13633'>There has only been one occurrence in these offices which could call for your attention. </span>
<span sid='13634' title='13634'>In whose interest are you acting, may I ask?</span>
<p>
<span sid='13635' title='13635'>'In that of Mr. Percy Phelps,' answered Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13636' title='13636'>'Ah, my unfortunate nephew! </span>
<span sid='13637' title='13637'>You can understand that our kinship makes it the more impossible for me to screen him in any way. </span>
<span sid='13638' title='13638'>I fear that the incident must have a very prejudicial effect upon his career.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13639' title='13639'>'But if the document is found?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13640' title='13640'>'Ah, that, of course, would be different.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13641' title='13641'>'I had one or two questions which I wished to ask you, Lord Holdhurst.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13642' title='13642'>'I shall be happy to give you any information in my power.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13643' title='13643'>'Was it in this room that you gave your instructions as to the copying of the document?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13644' title='13644'>'It was.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13645' title='13645'>'Then you could hardly have been overheard?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13646' title='13646'>'It is out of the question.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13647' title='13647'>'Did you ever mention to anyone that it was your intention to give out the treaty to be copied?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13648' title='13648'>'Never.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13649' title='13649'>'You are certain of that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13650' title='13650'>'Absolutely.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13651' title='13651'>'Well, since you never said so, and Mr. Phelps never said so, and nobody else knew anything of the matter, then the thief's presence in the room was purely accidental. </span>
<span sid='13652' title='13652'>He saw his chance and he took it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13653' title='13653'>The statesman smiled. </span>
<span sid='13654' title='13654'>'You take me out of my province there,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13655' title='13655'>Holmes considered for a moment. </span>
<span sid='13656' title='13656'>'There is another very important point which I wish to discuss with you,' said he. </span>
<span sid='13657' title='13657'>'You feared, as I understand, that very grave results might follow from the details of this treaty becoming known?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13658' title='13658'>A shadow passed over the expressive face of the statesman. </span>
<span sid='13659' title='13659'>'Very grave results, indeed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13660' title='13660'>'And have they occurred?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13661' title='13661'>'Not yet.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13662' title='13662'>'If the treaty had reached, let us say, the French or <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Russia&t=h'>Russia</a>n Foreign Office, you would expect to hear of it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13663' title='13663'>'I should,' said Lord Holdhurst, with a wry face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13664' title='13664'>'Since nearly ten weeks have elapsed, then, and nothing has been heard, it is not unfair to suppose that for some reason the treaty has not reached them?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13665' title='13665'>Lord Holdhurst shrugged his shoulders.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13666' title='13666'>'We can hardly suppose, Mr. Holmes, that the thief took the treaty in order to frame it and hang it up.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13667' title='13667'>'Perhaps he is waiting for a better price.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13668' title='13668'>'If he waits a little longer he will get no price at all. </span>
<span sid='13669' title='13669'>The treaty will cease to be a secret in a few months.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13670' title='13670'>'That is most important,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='13671' title='13671'>'Of course it is a possible supposition that the thief has had a sudden illness-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13672' title='13672'>'An attack of brain fever, for example?' asked the statesman, flashing a swift glance at him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13673' title='13673'>'I did not say so,' said Holmes, imperturbably. </span>
<span sid='13674' title='13674'>'And now, Lord Holdhurst, we have already taken up too much of your valuable time, and we shall wish you good day.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13675' title='13675'>'Every success to your investigation, be the criminal who it may,' answered the nobleman, as he bowed us out at the door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13676' title='13676'>'He's a fine fellow,' said Holmes, as we came out into <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Whitehall&t=h'>Whitehall</a>. </span>
<span sid='13677' title='13677'>'But he has a struggle to keep up his position. </span>
<span sid='13678' title='13678'>He is far from rich, and has many calls. </span>
<span sid='13679' title='13679'>You noticed, of course, that his boots had been re-soled? </span>
<span sid='13680' title='13680'>Now, Watson, I won't detain you from your legitimate work any longer. </span>
<span sid='13681' title='13681'>I shall do nothing more to-day, unless I have an answer to my cab advertisement. </span>
<span sid='13682' title='13682'>But I should be extremely obliged to you if you would come down with me to Woking to-morrow, by the same train which we took to-day.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13683' title='13683'>I met him accordingly next morning, and we travelled down to Woking together. </span>
<span sid='13684' title='13684'>He had had no answer to his advertisement, he said, and no fresh light had been thrown upon the case. </span>
<span sid='13685' title='13685'>He had, when he so willed it, the utter immobility of countenance of a Red Indian, and I could not gather from his appearance whether he was satisfied or not with the position of the case. </span>
<span sid='13686' title='13686'>His conversation, I remember, was about the Bertillon system of measurements, and he expressed his enthusiastic admiration of the French savant.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13687' title='13687'>We found our client still under the charge of his devoted nurse, but looking considerably better than before. </span>
<span sid='13688' title='13688'>He rose from the sofa and greeted us without difficulty when we entered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13689' title='13689'>'Any news?' he asked, eagerly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13690' title='13690'>'My report, as I expected, is a negative one,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='13691' title='13691'>'I have seen Forbes, and I have seen your uncle, and I have set one or two trains of inquiry upon foot which may lead to something.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13692' title='13692'>'You have not lost heart, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13693' title='13693'>'By no means.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13694' title='13694'>'God bless you for saying that!' cried Miss Harrison. </span>
<span sid='13695' title='13695'>'If we keep our courage and our patience, the truth must come out.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13696' title='13696'>'We have more to tell you than you have for us,' said Phelps, re-seating himself upon the couch.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13697' title='13697'>'I hoped you might have something.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13698' title='13698'>'Yes, we have had an adventure during the night, and one which might have proved to be a serious one.' </span>
<span sid='13699' title='13699'>His expression grew very grave as he spoke, and a look of something akin to fear sprang up in his eyes. </span>
<span sid='13700' title='13700'>'Do you know,' said he, 'that I begin to believe that I am the unconscious centre of some monstrous conspiracy, and that my life is aimed at as well as my honour?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13701' title='13701'>'Ah!' cried Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13702' title='13702'>'It sounds incredible, for I have not, as far as I know, an enemy in the world. </span>
<span sid='13703' title='13703'>Yet from last night's experience I can come to no other conclusion.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13704' title='13704'>'Pray let me hear it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13705' title='13705'>'You must know that last night was the very first night that I have ever slept without a nurse in the room. </span>
<span sid='13706' title='13706'>I was so much better that I thought I could dispense with one. </span>
<span sid='13707' title='13707'>I had a night-light burning, however. </span>
<span sid='13708' title='13708'>Well, about two in the morning I had sunk into a light sleep, when I was suddenly aroused by a slight noise. </span>
<span sid='13709' title='13709'>It was like the sound which a mouse makes when it is gnawing a plank, and I lay listening to it for some time under the impression that it must come from that cause. </span>
<span sid='13710' title='13710'>Then it grew louder, and suddenly there came from the window a sharp metallic snick.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13711' title='13711'>I sat up in amazement. </span>
<span sid='13712' title='13712'>There could be no doubt what the sounds were now. </span>
<span sid='13713' title='13713'>The faint ones had been caused by someone forcing an instrument through the slit between the sashes, and the second by the catch being pressed back.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13714' title='13714'>'There was a pause then for about ten minutes, as if the person were waiting to see whether the noise had awoken me. </span>
<span sid='13715' title='13715'>Then I heard a gentle creaking as the window was very slowly opened. </span>
<span sid='13716' title='13716'>I could stand it no longer, for my nerves are not what they used to be. </span>
<span sid='13717' title='13717'>I sprang out of bed and flung open the shutters. </span>
<span sid='13718' title='13718'>A man was crouching at the window. </span>
<span sid='13719' title='13719'>I could see little of him, for he was gone like a flash. </span>
<span sid='13720' title='13720'>He was wrapped in some sort of cloak, which came across the lower part of his face. </span>
<span sid='13721' title='13721'>One thing only I am sure of, and that is that he had some weapon in his hand. </span>
<span sid='13722' title='13722'>It looked to me like a long knife. </span>
<span sid='13723' title='13723'>I distinctly saw the gleam of it as he turned to run.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13724' title='13724'>'This is most interesting,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='13725' title='13725'>'Pray, what did you do then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13726' title='13726'>'I should have followed him through the open window if I had been stronger. </span>
<span sid='13727' title='13727'>As it was, I rang the bell and roused the house. </span>
<span sid='13728' title='13728'>It took me some little time, for the bell rings in the kitchen, and the servants all sleep upstairs. </span>
<span sid='13729' title='13729'>I shouted, however, and that brought Joseph down, and he roused the others. </span>
<span sid='13730' title='13730'>Joseph and the groom found marks on the flower-bed outside the window, but the weather has been so dry lately that they found it hopeless to follow the trail across the grass. </span>
<span sid='13731' title='13731'>There's a place, however, on the wooden fence which skirts the road which shows signs, they tell me, as if someone had got over and had snapped the top of the rail in doing so. </span>
<span sid='13732' title='13732'>I have said nothing to the local police yet, for I thought I had best have your opinion first.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13733' title='13733'>This tale of our client's appeared to have an extraordinary effect upon Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='13734' title='13734'>He rose from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable excitement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13735' title='13735'>'Misfortunes never come singly,' said Phelps, smiling, though it was evident that his adventure had somewhat shaken him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13736' title='13736'>'You have certainly had your share,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13737' title='13737'>'Do you think you could walk round the house with me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13738' title='13738'>'Oh, yes, I should like a little sunshine. </span>
<span sid='13739' title='13739'>Joseph will come too.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13740' title='13740'>'And I also,' said Miss Harrison.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13741' title='13741'>'I am afraid not,' said Holmes, shaking his head. </span>
<span sid='13742' title='13742'>'I think I must ask you to remain sitting exactly where you are.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13743' title='13743'>The young lady resumed her seat with an air of displeasure. </span>
<span sid='13744' title='13744'>Her brother, however, had joined us, and we set off all four together. </span>
<span sid='13745' title='13745'>We passed round the lawn to the outside of the young diplomatist's window. </span>
<span sid='13746' title='13746'>There were, as he had said, marks upon the flower-bed, but they were hopelessly blurred and vague. </span>
<span sid='13747' title='13747'>Holmes stooped over them for an instant, and then rose, shrugging his shoulders.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13748' title='13748'>'I don't think anyone could make much of this,' said he. </span>
<span sid='13749' title='13749'>'Let us go round the house and see why this particular room was chosen by the burglar. </span>
<span sid='13750' title='13750'>I should have thought those larger windows of the drawingroom and dining-room would have had more attractions for him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13751' title='13751'>'They are more visible from the road,' suggested Mr. Joseph Harrison.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13752' title='13752'>'Ah, yes, of course. </span>
<span sid='13753' title='13753'>There is a door here which he might have attempted. </span>
<span sid='13754' title='13754'>What is it for?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13755' title='13755'>'It is the side-entrance for tradespeople. </span>
<span sid='13756' title='13756'>Of course, it is locked at night!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13757' title='13757'>'But Percy?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13758' title='13758'>'He will come to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> with us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13759' title='13759'>'And I am to remain here?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13760' title='13760'>'It is for his sake. </span>
<span sid='13761' title='13761'>You can serve him! </span>
<span sid='13762' title='13762'>Quick! </span>
<span sid='13763' title='13763'>Promise!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13764' title='13764'>She gave a nod of assent just as the other two came up.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13765' title='13765'>'Why do you sit moping there, Annie?' cried her brother. </span>
<span sid='13766' title='13766'>'Come out into the sunshine!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13767' title='13767'>'No, thank you, Joseph. </span>
<span sid='13768' title='13768'>I have a slight headache, and this room is deliciously cool and soothing!</span>
<p>
<span sid='13769' title='13769'>'What do you propose now, Mr. Holmes?' asked our client.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13770' title='13770'>'Well, in investigating this minor affair we must not lose sight of our main inquiry. </span>
<span sid='13771' title='13771'>It would be a very great help to me if you could come up to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> with us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13772' title='13772'>'At once?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13773' title='13773'>'Well, as soon as you conveniently can. </span>
<span sid='13774' title='13774'>Say in an hour.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13775' title='13775'>'I feel quite strong enough, if I can really be of any help.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13776' title='13776'>'The greatest possible.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13777' title='13777'>'Perhaps you would like me to stay there to-night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13778' title='13778'>'I was just going to propose it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13779' title='13779'>'Then if my friend of the night comes to revisit me, he will find the bird flown. </span>
<span sid='13780' title='13780'>We are all in your hands, Mr. Holmes, and you must tell us exactly what you would like done. </span>
<span sid='13781' title='13781'>Perhaps you would prefer that Joseph came with us, so as to look after me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13782' title='13782'>'Oh, no; my friend Watson is a medical man, you know, and he'll look after you. </span>
<span sid='13783' title='13783'>We'll have our lunch here, if you will permit us, and then we shall all three set off for town together.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13784' title='13784'>It was arranged as he suggested, though Miss Harrison excused herself from leaving the bedroom, in accordance with Holmes's suggestion. </span>
<span sid='13785' title='13785'>What the object of my friend's manoeuvres was I could not conceive, unless it were to keep the lady away from Phelps, who, rejoiced by his returning health and by the prospect of action, lunched with us in the dining-room. </span>
<span sid='13786' title='13786'>Holmes had a still more startling surprise for us, however, for after accompanying us down to the station and seeing us into our carriage, he calmly announced that he had no intention of leaving Woking.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13787' title='13787'>'There are one or two small points which I should desire to clear up before I go,' said he. </span>
<span sid='13788' title='13788'>'Your absence, Mr. Phelps, will in some ways rather assist me. </span>
<span sid='13789' title='13789'>Watson, when you reach <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> you would oblige me by driving at once to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> with our friend here, and remaining with him until I see you again. </span>
<span sid='13790' title='13790'>It is fortunate that you are old schoolfellows, as you must have much to talk over. </span>
<span sid='13791' title='13791'>Mr. Phelps can have the spare bedroom to-night, and I shall be with you in time for breakfast, for there is a train which will take me into Waterloo at eight.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13792' title='13792'>'But how about our investigation in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>?' asked Phelps, ruefully.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13793' title='13793'>'We can do that to-morrow. </span>
<span sid='13794' title='13794'>I think that just at present I can be of more immediate use here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13795' title='13795'>'You might tell them at Briarbrae that I hope to be back to-morrow night,' cried Phelps, as we began to move from the platform.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13796' title='13796'>'I hardly expect to go back to Briarbrae,' answered Holmes, and waved his hand to us cheerily as we shot out from the station.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13797' title='13797'>Phelps and I talked it over on our journey, but neither of us could devise a satisfactory reason for this new development.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13798' title='13798'>'I suppose he wants to find out some clue as to the burglary last night, if a burglar it was. </span>
<span sid='13799' title='13799'>For myself, I don't believe it was an ordinary thief.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13800' title='13800'>'What is your idea, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13801' title='13801'>'Upon my word, you may put it down to my weak nerves or not, but I believe there is some deep political intrigue going on around me, and that, for some reason that passes my understanding, my life is aimed at by the conspirators. </span>
<span sid='13802' title='13802'>It sounds high-flown and absurd, but consider the facts! </span>
<span sid='13803' title='13803'>Why should a thief try to break in at a bedroom window, where there could be no hope of any plunder, and why should he come with a long knife in his hand?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13804' title='13804'>'You are sure it was not a housebreaker's jemmy?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13805' title='13805'>'Oh, no; it was a knife. </span>
<span sid='13806' title='13806'>I saw the flash of the blade quite distinctly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13807' title='13807'>'But why on earth should you be pursued with such animosity?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13808' title='13808'>'Ah! that is the question.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13809' title='13809'>'Well, if Holmes takes the same view, that would account for his action, would it not? </span>
<span sid='13810' title='13810'>Presuming that your theory is correct, if he can lay his hands upon the man who threatened you last night, he will have gone a long way towards finding who took the naval treaty. </span>
<span sid='13811' title='13811'>It is absurd to suppose that you have two enemies, one of whom robs you while the other threatens your life.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13812' title='13812'>'But Mr. Holmes said that he was not going to Briarbrae.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13813' title='13813'>'I have known him for some time,' said I, 'but I never knew him do anything yet without a very good reason,' and with that our conversation drifted off into other topics.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13814' title='13814'>But it was a weary day for me. </span>
<span sid='13815' title='13815'>Phelps was still weak after his long illness, and his misfortunes made him querulous and nervous. </span>
<span sid='13816' title='13816'>In vain I endeavoured to interest him in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Afghanistan&t=h'>Afghanistan</a>, in India, in social questions, in anything which might take his mind out of the groove. </span>
<span sid='13817' title='13817'>He would always come back to his lost treaty; wondering, guessing, speculating, as to what Holmes was doing, what steps Lord Holdhurst was taking, what news we should have in the morning. </span>
<span sid='13818' title='13818'>As the evening wore on his excitement became quite painful.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13819' title='13819'>'You have implicit faith in Holmes?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13820' title='13820'>'I have seen him do some remarkable things.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13821' title='13821'>'But he never brought light into anything quite so dark as this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13822' title='13822'>'Oh, yes; I have known him solve questions which presented fewer clues than yours.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13823' title='13823'>'But not where such large interests are at stake?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13824' title='13824'>'I don't know that. </span>
<span sid='13825' title='13825'>To my certain knowledge he has acted on behalf of three of the reigning Houses of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a> in very vital matters.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13826' title='13826'>'But you know him well, Watson. </span>
<span sid='13827' title='13827'>He is such an inscrutable fellow, that I never quite know what to make of him. </span>
<span sid='13828' title='13828'>Do you think he is hopeful? </span>
<span sid='13829' title='13829'>Do you think he expects to make a success of it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13830' title='13830'>'He has said nothing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13831' title='13831'>'That is a bad sign.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13832' title='13832'>'On the contrary, I have noticed that when he is off the trail he generally says so. </span>
<span sid='13833' title='13833'>It is when he is on a scent, and is not quite absolutely sure yet that it is the right one, that he is most taciturn. </span>
<span sid='13834' title='13834'>Now, my dear fellow, we can't help matters by making ourselves nervous about them, so let me implore you to go to bed, and so be fresh for whatever may await us tomorrow.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13835' title='13835'>I was able at last to persuade my companion to take my advice, though I knew from his excited manner that there was not much hope of sleep for him. </span>
<span sid='13836' title='13836'>Indeed, his mood was infectious, for I lay tossing half the night myself, brooding over this strange problem, and inventing a hundred theories, each of which was more impossible than the last. </span>
<span sid='13837' title='13837'>Why had Holmes remained at Woking? </span>
<span sid='13838' title='13838'>Why had he asked Miss Harrison to stay in the sick-room all day? </span>
<span sid='13839' title='13839'>Why had he been so careful not to inform the people at Briarbrae that he intended to remain near them? </span>
<span sid='13840' title='13840'>I cudgelled my brains until I fell asleep in the endeavour to find some explanation which would cover all these facts.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13841' title='13841'>It was seven o'clock when I awoke, and I set off at once for Phelps' room, to find him haggard and spent after a sleepless night. </span>
<span sid='13842' title='13842'>His first question was whether Holmes had arrived yet.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13843' title='13843'>'He'll be here when he promised,' said I, 'and not an instant sooner or later.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13844' title='13844'>And my words were true, for shortly after eight a hansom dashed up to the door and our friend got out of it. </span>
<span sid='13845' title='13845'>Standing in the window, we saw that his left hand was swathed in a bandage and that his face was very grim and pale. </span>
<span sid='13846' title='13846'>He entered the house, but it was some little time before he came upstairs.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13847' title='13847'>'He looks like a beaten man,' cried Phelps.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13848' title='13848'>I was forced to confess that he was right. </span>
<span sid='13849' title='13849'>'After all,' said I, 'the clue of the matter lies probably here in town.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13850' title='13850'>Phelps gave a groan.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13851' title='13851'>'I don't know how it is,' said he, 'but I had hoped for so much from his return. </span>
<span sid='13852' title='13852'>But surely his hand was not tied up like that yesterday? </span>
<span sid='13853' title='13853'>What can be the matter?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13854' title='13854'>'You are not wounded, Holmes?' I asked, as my friend entered the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13855' title='13855'>'Tut, it is only a scratch through my own clumsiness,' he answered, nodding his good morning to us. </span>
<span sid='13856' title='13856'>'This case of yours, Mr. Phelps, is certainly one of the darkest which I have ever investigated.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13857' title='13857'>'I feared that you would find it beyond you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13858' title='13858'>'It has been a most remarkable experience.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13859' title='13859'>'That bandage tells of adventures,' said I. </span>
<span sid='13860' title='13860'>'Won't you tell us what has happened?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13861' title='13861'>'After breakfast, my dear Watson. </span>
<span sid='13862' title='13862'>Remember that I have breathed thirty miles of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Surrey&t=h'>Surrey</a> air this morning. </span>
<span sid='13863' title='13863'>I suppose there has been no answer to my cabman advertisement? </span>
<span sid='13864' title='13864'>Well, well, we cannot expect to score every time.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13865' title='13865'>The table was all laid, and, just as I was about to ring, Mrs. Hudson entered with the tea and coffee. </span>
<span sid='13866' title='13866'>A few minutes later she brought in the covers, and we all drew up to the table, Holmes ravenous, I curious, and Phelps in the gloomiest state of depression.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13867' title='13867'>'Mrs. Hudson has risen to the occasion,' said Holmes, uncovering a dish of curried chicken. </span>
<span sid='13868' title='13868'>'Her cuisine is a little limited, but she has as good an idea of breakfast as a Scotchwoman. </span>
<span sid='13869' title='13869'>What have you there, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13870' title='13870'>'Ham and eggs,' I answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13871' title='13871'>'Good! </span>
<span sid='13872' title='13872'>What are you going to take, Mr. Phelps: curried fowl, eggs, or will you help yourself?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13873' title='13873'>'Thank you, I can eat nothing,' said Phelps.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13874' title='13874'>'Oh, come! </span>
<span sid='13875' title='13875'>Try the dish before you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13876' title='13876'>'Thank you, I would really rather not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13877' title='13877'>'Well, then,' said Holmes, with a mischievous twinkle, 'I suppose that you have no objection to helping me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13878' title='13878'>Phelps raised the cover, and as he did so he uttered a scream, and sat there staring with a face as white as the plate upon which he looked. </span>
<span sid='13879' title='13879'>Across the centre of it was lying a little cylinder of blue-grey paper.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13880' title='13880'>He caught it up, devoured it with his eyes, and then danced madly about the room, pressing it to his bosom and shrieking out in his delight. </span>
<span sid='13881' title='13881'>Then he fell back into an arm-chair, so limp and exhausted with his own emotions that we had to pour brandy down his throat to keep him from fainting.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13882' title='13882'>'There! there!' said Holmes, soothingly, patting him upon the shoulder. </span>
<span sid='13883' title='13883'>'It was too bad to spring it on you like this; but Watson here will tell you that I never can resist a touch of the dramatic.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13884' title='13884'>Phelps seized his hand and kissed it. </span>
<span sid='13885' title='13885'>'God bless you!' he cried; 'you have saved my honour.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13886' title='13886'>'Well, my own was at stake, you know,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='13887' title='13887'>'I assure you, it is just as hateful to me to fail in a case as it can be to you to blunder over a commission.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13888' title='13888'>Phelps thrust away the precious document into the innermost pocket of his coat.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13889' title='13889'>'I have not the heart to interrupt your breakfast any further, and yet I am dying to know how you got it and where it was.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13890' title='13890'>Sherlock Holmes swallowed a cup of coffee and turned his attention to the ham and eggs. </span>
<span sid='13891' title='13891'>Then he rose, lit his pipe, and settled himself down into his chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13892' title='13892'>'I'll tell you what I did first, and how I came to do it afterwards,' said he. </span>
<span sid='13893' title='13893'>'After leaving you at the station I went for a charming walk through some admirable <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Surrey&t=h'>Surrey</a> scenery to a pretty little village called Ripley, where I had my tea at an inn, and took the precaution of filling my flask and of putting a paper of sandwiches in my pocket. </span>
<span sid='13894' title='13894'>There I remained until evening, when I set off for Woking again and found myself in the high-road outside Briarbrae just after sunset.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13895' title='13895'>'Well, I waited until the road was clear - it is never a very frequented one at any time, I fancy - and then I clambered over the fence into the grounds.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13896' title='13896'>'Surely the gate was open?' ejaculated Phelps.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13897' title='13897'>'Yes; but I have a peculiar taste in these matters. </span>
<span sid='13898' title='13898'>I chose the place where the three fir trees stand, and behind their screen I got over without the least chance of anyone in the house being able to see me. </span>
<span sid='13899' title='13899'>I crouched down among the bushes on the other side, and crawled from one to the other - witness the disreputable state of my trouser knees - until I had reached the clump of rhododendrons just opposite to your bedroom window. </span>
<span sid='13900' title='13900'>There I squatted down and awaited developments.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13901' title='13901'>'The blind was not down in your room, and I could see Miss Harrison sitting there reading by the table. </span>
<span sid='13902' title='13902'>It was a quarter past ten when she closed her book, fastened the shutters, and retired. </span>
<span sid='13903' title='13903'>I heard her shut the door, and felt quite sure that she had turned the key in the lock.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13904' title='13904'>'The key?' ejaculated Phelps.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13905' title='13905'>'Yes, I had given Miss Harrison instructions to lock the door on the outside and take the key with her when she went to bed. </span>
<span sid='13906' title='13906'>She carried out every one of my injunctions to the letter, and certainly without her co-operation you would not have that paper in your coat pocket. </span>
<span sid='13907' title='13907'>She departed then, the lights went out, and I was left squatting in the rhododendron bush.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13908' title='13908'>'The night was fine, but still it was a very weary vigil. </span>
<span sid='13909' title='13909'>Of course, it has the sort of excitement about it that the sportsman feels when he lies beside the watercourse and waits for the big game. </span>
<span sid='13910' title='13910'>It was very long, though - almost as long, Watson, as when you and I waited in that deadly room when we looked into the little problem of the "Speckled Band." </span>
<span sid='13911' title='13911'>There was a church clock down at Woking which struck the quarters, and I thought more than once that it had stopped. </span>
<span sid='13912' title='13912'>At last, however, about two in the morning, I suddenly heard the gentle sound of a bolt being pushed back, and the creaking of a key. </span>
<span sid='13913' title='13913'>A moment later the servants' door was opened and Mr. Joseph Harrison stepped out into the moonlight.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13914' title='13914'>'Joseph!' ejaculated Phelps.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13915' title='13915'>'He was bare-headed, but he had a black cloak thrown over his shoulder, so that he could conceal his face in an instant if there were any alarm. </span>
<span sid='13916' title='13916'>He walked on tiptoe under the shadow of the wall, and when he reached the window, he worked a long-bladed knife through the sash and pushed back the catch. </span>
<span sid='13917' title='13917'>Then he flung open the window and, putting his knife through the crack in the shutters, he thrust the bar up and swung them open.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13918' title='13918'>'From where I lay I had a perfect view of the inside of the room and of every one of his movements. </span>
<span sid='13919' title='13919'>He lit the two candles which stand upon the mantelpiece, and then he proceeded to turn back the corner of the carpet in the neighbourhood of the door. </span>
<span sid='13920' title='13920'>Presently he stooped and picked out a square piece of board, such as is usually left to enable plumbers to get at the joints of the gas pipes. </span>
<span sid='13921' title='13921'>This one covered, as a matter of fact, the T-joint which gives off the pipe which supplies the kitchen underneath. </span>
<span sid='13922' title='13922'>Out of this hiding-place he drew that little cylinder of paper, pushed down the board, rearranged the carpet, blew out the candles, and walked straight into my arms as I stood waiting for him outside the window.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13923' title='13923'>'Well, he has rather more viciousness than I gave him credit for, has Master Joseph. </span>
<span sid='13924' title='13924'>He flew at me with his knife, and I had to grass him twice, and got a cut over the knuckles, before I had the upper hand of  him. </span>
<span sid='13925' title='13925'>He looked "murder" out of the only eye he could see with when we had finished, but he listened to reason and gave up the papers. </span>
<span sid='13926' title='13926'>Having got them I let my man go, but I wired full particulars to Forbes this morning. </span>
<span sid='13927' title='13927'>If he is quick enough to catch his bird, well and good! </span>
<span sid='13928' title='13928'>But if, as I shrewdly suspect, he finds the nest empty before he gets there, why, all the better for the Government. </span>
<span sid='13929' title='13929'>I fancy that Lord Holdhurst, for one, and Mr. Percy Phelps, for another, would very much rather that the affair never got so far as a police-court.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13930' title='13930'>'My God!' gasped our client. </span>
<span sid='13931' title='13931'>'Do you tell me that during these long ten weeks of agony, the stolen papers were within the very room with me all the time?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13932' title='13932'>'So it was.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13933' title='13933'>'And Joseph! </span>
<span sid='13934' title='13934'>Joseph a villain and a thief!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13935' title='13935'>'Hum! I am afraid Joseph's character is a rather deeper and more dangerous one than one might judge from his appearance. </span>
<span sid='13936' title='13936'>From what I have heard from him this morning, I gather that he has lost heavily in dabbling with stocks, and that he is ready to do anything on earth to better his fortunes. </span>
<span sid='13937' title='13937'>Being an absolutely selfish man, when a chance presented itself he did not allow either his sister's happiness or your reputation to hold his hand.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13938' title='13938'>Percy Phelps sank back in his chair. </span>
<span sid='13939' title='13939'>'My head whirls,' said he; 'your words have dazed me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13940' title='13940'>'The principal difficulty in your case,' remarked Holmes, in his didactic fashion, 'lay in the fact of there being too much evidence. </span>
<span sid='13941' title='13941'>What was vital was overlaid and hidden by what was irrelevant. </span>
<span sid='13942' title='13942'>Of all the facts which were presented to us, we had to pick just those which we deemed to be essential, and then piece them together in their order, so as to reconstruct this very remarkable chain of events. </span>
<span sid='13943' title='13943'>I had already begun to suspect Joseph, from the fact that you had intended to travel home with him that night, and that therefore it was a likely enough thing that he should call for you - knowing the Foreign Office well - upon his way. </span>
<span sid='13944' title='13944'>When I heard that someone had been so anxious to get into the bedroom, in which no one but Joseph could have concealed anything - you told us in your narrative how you had turned Joseph out when you arrived with the doctor - my suspicions all changed to certainties, especially as the attempt was made on the first night upon which the nurse was absent, showing that the intruder was well acquainted with the ways of the house.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13945' title='13945'>'How blind I have been!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13946' title='13946'>'The facts of the case, as far as I have worked them out, are these: This Joseph Harrison entered the office through the Charles Street door, and knowing his way he walked straight into your room the instant after you left it. </span>
<span sid='13947' title='13947'>Finding no one there he promptly rang the bell, and at the instant that he did so his eyes caught the paper upon the table. </span>
<span sid='13948' title='13948'>A glance showed him that chance had put in his way a State document of immense value, and in a flash he had thrust it into his pocket and was gone. </span>
<span sid='13949' title='13949'>A few minutes elapsed, as you remember, before the sleepy commissionaire drew your attention to the bell, and those were just enough to give the thief time to make his escape.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13950' title='13950'>'He made his way to Woking by the first train, and, having examined his booty, and assured himself that it really was of immense value, he concealed it in what he thought was a very safe place, with the intention of taking it out again in a day or two, and carrying it to the French Embassy, or wherever he thought that a long price was to be had. </span>
<span sid='13951' title='13951'>Then came your sudden return. </span>
<span sid='13952' title='13952'>He, without a moment's warning, was bundled out of his room, and from that time onwards there were always at least two of you there to prevent him from regaining his treasure. </span>
<span sid='13953' title='13953'>The situation to him must have been a maddening one. </span>
<span sid='13954' title='13954'>But at last he thought he saw his chance. </span>
<span sid='13955' title='13955'>He tried to steal in, but was baffled by your wakefulness. </span>
<span sid='13956' title='13956'>You may remember that you did not take your usual draught that night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13957' title='13957'>'I remember.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13958' title='13958'>'I fancy that he had taken steps to make that draught efficacious, and that he quite relied upon your being unconscious. </span>
<span sid='13959' title='13959'>Of course, I understood that he would repeat the attempt whenever it could be done with safety. </span>
<span sid='13960' title='13960'>Your leaving the room gave him the chance he wanted. </span>
<span sid='13961' title='13961'>I kept Miss Harrison in it all day, so that he might not anticipate us. </span>
<span sid='13962' title='13962'>Then, having given him the idea that the coast was clear, I kept guard as I have described. </span>
<span sid='13963' title='13963'>I already knew that the papers were probably in the room, but I had no desire to rip up all the planking and skirting in search of them. </span>
<span sid='13964' title='13964'>I let him take them, therefore, from the hiding-place, and so saved myself an infinity of trouble. </span>
<span sid='13965' title='13965'>Is there any other point which I can make clear?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13966' title='13966'>'Why did he try the window on the first occasion,' I asked, 'when he might have entered by the door?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13967' title='13967'>'In reaching the door he would have to pass seven bedrooms. </span>
<span sid='13968' title='13968'>On the other hand, he could get out on to the lawn with ease. </span>
<span sid='13969' title='13969'>Anything else?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13970' title='13970'>'You do not think,' asked Phelps, 'that he had any murderous intention? </span>
<span sid='13971' title='13971'>The knife was only meant as a tool.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13972' title='13972'>'It may be so,' answered Holmes, shrugging his shoulders. </span>
<span sid='13973' title='13973'>'I can only say for certain that Mr. Joseph Harrison is a gentleman to whose mercy I should be extremely unwilling to trust.'</span>
