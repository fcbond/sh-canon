<h1><span sid='45111' title='45111'>The Adventure of the Blanched Soldier</span></h1>
<p class="subtitle">Arthur Conan Doyle<label for="sn-meta-blan" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-meta-blan" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><!--googleoff: all--><b>Story Number</b>: 56<br><b>Published in</b>: Liberty magazine on 16 October 1926 (US)<br><b>Collected in</b>: The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes<!--googleon: all--></span></p>
<p>
<span sid='45112' title='45112'>The ideas of my friend Watson, though limited, are exceedingly pertinacious. </span>
<span sid='45113' title='45113'>For a long time he has worried me to write an experience of my own. </span>
<span sid='45114' title='45114'>Perhaps I have rather invited this persecution, since I have often had occasion to point out to him how superficial are his own accounts and to accuse him of pandering to popular taste instead of confining himself rigidly to fact and figures. </span>
<span sid='45115' title='45115'>'Try it yourself, Holmes!' </span>
<span sid='45116' title='45116'>he has retorted, and I am compelled to admit that, having taken my pen in my hand, I do begin to realize that the matter must be presented in such a way as may interest the reader. </span>
<span sid='45117' title='45117'>The following case can hardly fail to do so, as it is among the strangest happenings in my collection, though it chanced that Watson had no note of it in his collection. </span>
<span sid='45118' title='45118'>Speaking of my old friend and biographer, I would take this opportunity to remark that if I burden myself with a companion in my various little inquiries it is not done out of sentiment or caprice, but it is that Watson has some remarkable characteristics of his own, to which in his modesty he has given small attention amid his exaggerated estimates of my own performances. </span>
<span sid='45119' title='45119'>A confederate who foresees your conclusions and course of action is always dangerous, but one to whom each development comes as a perpetual surprise, and to whom the future is always a closed book, is, indeed, an ideal helpmate.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45120' title='45120'>I find from my notebook that it was in January 1903, just after the conclusion of the Boer War, that I had my visit from Mr James M. Dodd, a big, fresh, sunburned, upstanding Briton. </span>
<span sid='45121' title='45121'>The good Watson had at that time deserted me for a wife, the only selfish action which I can recall in our association. </span>
<span sid='45122' title='45122'>I was alone.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45123' title='45123'>It is my habit to sit with my back to the window and to place my visitors in the opposite chair, where the light falls full upon them. </span>
<span sid='45124' title='45124'>Mr James M. Dodd seemed somewhat at a loss how to begin the interview. </span>
<span sid='45125' title='45125'>I did not attempt to help him, for his silence gave me more time for observation. </span>
<span sid='45126' title='45126'>I have found it wise to impress clients with a sense of power, and so I gave him some of my conclusions.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45127' title='45127'>'From South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>, sir, I perceive.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45128' title='45128'>'Yes, sir,' he answered, with some surprise.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45129' title='45129'>'Imperial Yeomanry, I fancy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45130' title='45130'>'Exactly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45131' title='45131'>'<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Middlesex&t=h'>Middlesex</a> Corps, no doubt.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45132' title='45132'>'That is so. </span>
<span sid='45133' title='45133'>Mr Holmes, you are a wizard.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45134' title='45134'>I smiled at his bewildered expression.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45135' title='45135'>'When a gentleman of virile appearance enters my room with such tan upon his face as an English sun could never give, and with his handkerchief in his sleeve instead of in his pocket, it is not difficult to place him. </span>
<span sid='45136' title='45136'>You wear a short beard, which shows that you were not a regular. </span>
<span sid='45137' title='45137'>You have the cut of a riding-man. </span>
<span sid='45138' title='45138'>As to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Middlesex&t=h'>Middlesex</a>, your card has already shown me that you are a stockbroker from Throgmorton Street. </span>
<span sid='45139' title='45139'>What other regiment would you join?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45140' title='45140'>'You see everything.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45141' title='45141'>'I see no more than you, but I have trained myself to notice what I see. </span>
<span sid='45142' title='45142'>However, Mr Dodd, it was not to discuss the science of observation that you called upon me this morning. </span>
<span sid='45143' title='45143'>What has been happening at Tuxbury Old Park?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45144' title='45144'>'Mr Holmes-!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45145' title='45145'>'My dear sir, there is no mystery. </span>
<span sid='45146' title='45146'>Your letter came with that heading, and as you fixed this appointment in very pressing terms, it was clear that something sudden and important had occurred.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45147' title='45147'>'Yes, indeed. </span>
<span sid='45148' title='45148'>But the letter was written in the afternoon, and a good deal has happened since then. </span>
<span sid='45149' title='45149'>If Colonel Emsworth had not kicked me out-'</span>
<span sid='45151' title='45151'>'Kicked you out!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45152' title='45152'>He is a hard nail, is Colonel Emsworth. </span>
<span sid='45153' title='45153'>The greatest martinet in the Army in his day, and it was a day of rough language, too. </span>
<span sid='45154' title='45154'>I couldn't have stuck the Colonel if it had not been for Godfrey's sake.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45155' title='45155'>I lit my pipe and leaned back in my chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45156' title='45156'>'Perhaps you will explain what you are talking about.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45157' title='45157'>My client grinned mischievously.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45158' title='45158'>'I had got into the way of supposing that you knew everything without being told,' said he. </span>
<span sid='45159' title='45159'>'But I will give you the facts, and I hope to God that you will be able to tell me what they mean. </span>
<span sid='45160' title='45160'>I've been awake all night puzzling my brain, and the more I think the more incredible does it become.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45161' title='45161'>'When I joined up in January, 1901 - just two years ago - young Godfrey Emsworth had joined the same squadron. </span>
<span sid='45162' title='45162'>He was Colonel Emsworth's only son - Emsworth, the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Crimea&t=h'>Crimea</a>n VC - and he had the fighting blood in him, so it is no wonder he volunteered. </span>
<span sid='45163' title='45163'>There was not a finer lad in the regiment. </span>
<span sid='45164' title='45164'>We formed a friendship - the sort of friendship which can only be made when one lives the same life and shares the same joys and sorrows. </span>
<span sid='45165' title='45165'>He was my mate - and that means a good deal in the Army. </span>
<span sid='45166' title='45166'>We took the rough and the smooth together for a year of hard fighting. </span>
<span sid='45167' title='45167'>The he was hit with a bullet from an elephant gun in the action near Diamond Hill outside Pretoria. </span>
<span sid='45168' title='45168'>I got one letter from the hospital at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Cape Town&t=h'>Cape Town</a> and one from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Southampton&t=h'>Southampton</a>. </span>
<span sid='45169' title='45169'>Since then not a word - not one word, Mr Holmes, for six months and more, and he my closest pal.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45170' title='45170'>'Well, when the war was over, and we all got back, I wrote to his father and asked where Godfrey was. </span>
<span sid='45171' title='45171'>No answer. </span>
<span sid='45172' title='45172'>I waited a bit and then I wrote again. </span>
<span sid='45173' title='45173'>This time I had a reply, short and gruff. </span>
<span sid='45174' title='45174'>Godfrey had gone on a voyage round the world, and it was not likely that he would be back for a year. </span>
<span sid='45175' title='45175'>That was all.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45176' title='45176'>'I wasn't satisfied, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='45177' title='45177'>The whole thing seemed to me so damned unnatural. </span>
<span sid='45178' title='45178'>He was a good lad and he would not drop a pal like that. </span>
<span sid='45179' title='45179'>It was not like him. </span>
<span sid='45180' title='45180'>Then, again, I happened to know that he was heir to a lot of money, and also that his father and he did not always hit it off too well. </span>
<span sid='45181' title='45181'>The old man was sometimes a bully, and young Godfrey had too much spirit to stand it. </span>
<span sid='45182' title='45182'>No, I wasn't satisfied, and I determined that I would get to the root of the matter. </span>
<span sid='45183' title='45183'>It happened, however, that my own affairs needed a lot of straightening out, after two years' absence, and so it is only this week that I have been able to take up Godfrey's case again. </span>
<span sid='45184' title='45184'>But since I have taken it up I mean to drop everything in order to see it through.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45185' title='45185'>Mr James M. Dodd appeared to be the sort of person whom it would be better to have as a friend than as an enemy. </span>
<span sid='45186' title='45186'>His blue eyes were stern and his square jaw had set hard as he spoke.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45187' title='45187'>'Well, what have you done?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45188' title='45188'>'My first move was to get down to his home, Tuxbury Old Park, near Bedford, and to see for myself how the ground lay. </span>
<span sid='45189' title='45189'>I wrote to the mother, therefore - I had had quite enough of the curmudgeon of a father - and I made a clean frontal attack: Godfrey was my chum, I had a great deal of interest which I might tell her of our common experiences, I should be in the neighbourhood, would there be any objection, et cetera? </span>
<span sid='45190' title='45190'>In reply I had quite an amiable answer from her and an offer to put me up for the night. </span>
<span sid='45191' title='45191'>That was what took me down on Monday.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45192' title='45192'>'Tuxbury Old Hall is inaccessible - five miles from anywhere. </span>
<span sid='45193' title='45193'>There was no trap at the station, so I had to walk, carrying my suit-case, and it was nearly dark before I arrived. </span>
<span sid='45194' title='45194'>It is a great wandering house, standing in a considerable park. </span>
<span sid='45195' title='45195'>I should judge it was of all sorts of ages and styles, starting on a half-timbered Elizabethan foundation and ending in a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Victoria&t=h'>Victoria</a>n portico. </span>
<span sid='45196' title='45196'>Inside it was all panelling and tapestry and half-effaced old pictures, a house of shadows and mystery. </span>
<span sid='45197' title='45197'>There was a butler, old Ralph, who seemed about the same age as the house, and there was his wife, who might have been older. </span>
<span sid='45198' title='45198'>She had been Godfrey's nurse, and I had heard him speak of her as second only to his mother in his affections, so I was drawn to her in spite of her queer appearance. </span>
<span sid='45199' title='45199'>The mother I liked also - a gentle little white mouse of a woman. </span>
<span sid='45200' title='45200'>It was only the Colonel himself whom I barred.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45201' title='45201'>'We had a bit of a barney right away, and I should have walked back to the station if I had not felt that it might be playing his game for me to do so. </span>
<span sid='45202' title='45202'>I was shown straight into his study, and there I found him, a huge, bow-backed man with a smoky skin and a straggling grey beard, seated behind his littered desk. </span>
<span sid='45203' title='45203'>A red-veined nose jutted out like a vulture's beak, and two fierce grey eyes glared at me from under tufted brows. </span>
<span sid='45204' title='45204'>I could understand now why Godfrey seldom spoke of his father.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45205' title='45205'>'"Well, sir," said he in a rasping voice. </span>
<span sid='45206' title='45206'>"I should be interested to know the real reasons for this visit."</span>
<p>
<span sid='45207' title='45207'>'I answered that I had explained them in my letter to his wife.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45208' title='45208'>'"Yes, yes, you said that you had known Godfrey in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>. </span>
<span sid='45209' title='45209'>We have, of course, only your word for that."</span>
<p>
<span sid='45210' title='45210'>'"I have his letters to me in my pocket."</span>
<p>
<span sid='45211' title='45211'>'"Kindly let me see them."</span>
<p>
<span sid='45212' title='45212'>'He glanced at the two which I handed him, and then he tossed them back.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45213' title='45213'>'"Well, what then?" he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45214' title='45214'>'"I was fond of your son Godfrey, sir. </span>
<span sid='45215' title='45215'>Many ties and memories united us. </span>
<span sid='45216' title='45216'>Is it not natural that I should wonder at his sudden silence and should wish to know what has become of him?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='45217' title='45217'>'"I have some recollection, sir, that I had already corresponded with you and had told you what had become of him. </span>
<span sid='45218' title='45218'>He has gone upon a voyage round the world. </span>
<span sid='45219' title='45219'>His health was in a poor way after his <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>n experiences, and both his mother and I were of opinion that complete rest and change were needed. </span>
<span sid='45220' title='45220'>Kindly pass that explanation on to any other friends who may be interested in the matter."</span>
<p>
<span sid='45221' title='45221'>'"Certainly," I answered. </span>
<span sid='45222' title='45222'>"But perhaps you would have the goodness to let me have the name of the steamer and of the line by which he sailed, together with the date. </span>
<span sid='45223' title='45223'>I have no doubt that I should be able to get a letter through to him."</span>
<p>
<span sid='45224' title='45224'>'My request seemed both to puzzle and to irritate my host. </span>
<span sid='45225' title='45225'>His great eyebrows came down over his eyes and he tapped his fingers impatiently on the table. </span>
<span sid='45226' title='45226'>He looked up at last with the expression of one who has seen his adversary make a dangerous move at chess, and has decided how to meet it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45227' title='45227'>'"Many people, Mr Dodd," said he, "would take offence at your infernal pertinacity and would think that this insistence had reached the point of damned impertinence."</span>
<p>
<span sid='45228' title='45228'>'"You must put it down, sir, to my real love for your son."</span>
<p>
<span sid='45229' title='45229'>'"Exactly. </span>
<span sid='45230' title='45230'>I have already made every allowance upon that score. </span>
<span sid='45231' title='45231'>I must ask you, however, to drop these inquiries. </span>
<span sid='45232' title='45232'>Every family has its own inner knowledge and its own motives, which cannot always be made clear to outsiders, however well-intentioned. </span>
<span sid='45233' title='45233'>My wife is anxious to hear something of Godfrey's past which you are in a position to tell her, but I would ask you to let the present and the future alone. </span>
<span sid='45234' title='45234'>Such inquiries serve no useful purpose, sir, and place us in a delicate and difficult position."</span>
<p>
<span sid='45235' title='45235'>'So I came to a dead end, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='45236' title='45236'>There was no getting past it. </span>
<span sid='45237' title='45237'>I could only pretend to accept the situation and register a vow inwardly that I would never rest until my friend's fate had been cleared up. </span>
<span sid='45238' title='45238'>It was a dull evening. </span>
<span sid='45239' title='45239'>We dined quietly, the three of us, in a gloomy, faded old room. </span>
<span sid='45240' title='45240'>The lady questioned me eagerly about her son, but the old man seemed morose and depressed. </span>
<span sid='45241' title='45241'>I was so bored by the whole proceeding that I made an excuse as soon as I decently could and retired to my bedroom. </span>
<span sid='45242' title='45242'>It was a large, bare room on the ground floor, as gloomy as the rest of the house, but after a year of sleeping upon the veldt, Mr Holmes, one is not too particular about one's quarters. </span>
<span sid='45243' title='45243'>I opened the curtains and looked out into the garden, remarking that it was a fine night with a bright half-moon. </span>
<span sid='45244' title='45244'>Then I sat down by the roaring fire with the lamp on a table beside me, and endeavoured to distract my mind with a novel. </span>
<span sid='45245' title='45245'>I was interrupted, however, by Ralph, the old butler, who came in with a fresh supply of coals.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45246' title='45246'>'"I thought you might run short in the night-time, sir. </span>
<span sid='45247' title='45247'>It is bitter weather and these rooms are cold."</span>
<p>
<span sid='45248' title='45248'>'He hesitated before leaving the room, and when I looked round he was standing facing me with a wistful look upon his wrinkled face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45249' title='45249'>'"Beg your pardon, sir, but I could not help hearing what you said of young Master Godfrey at dinner. </span>
<span sid='45250' title='45250'>You know, sir, that my wife nursed him, and so I may say I am his foster-father. </span>
<span sid='45251' title='45251'>It's natural we should take an interest. </span>
<span sid='45252' title='45252'>And you say he carried himself well, sir?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='45253' title='45253'>'"There was no braver man in the regiment. </span>
<span sid='45254' title='45254'>He pulled me out once from under the rifles of the Boers, or maybe I should not be here."</span>
<p>
<span sid='45255' title='45255'>'The old butler rubbed his skinny hands.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45256' title='45256'>'"Yes, sir, yes, that is Master Godfrey all over. </span>
<span sid='45257' title='45257'>He was always courageous. </span>
<span sid='45258' title='45258'>There's not a tree in the park, sir, that he has not climbed. </span>
<span sid='45259' title='45259'>Nothing would stop him. </span>
<span sid='45260' title='45260'>He was a fine boy - and oh, sir, he was a fine man."</span>
<p>
<span sid='45261' title='45261'>'I sprang to my feet.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45262' title='45262'>'"Look here!" I cried. </span>
<span sid='45263' title='45263'>"You say he was. </span>
<span sid='45264' title='45264'>You speak as if he were dead. </span>
<span sid='45265' title='45265'>What is all this mystery? </span>
<span sid='45266' title='45266'>What has become of Godfrey Emsworth?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='45267' title='45267'>'I gripped the old man by the shoulder, but he shrank away.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45268' title='45268'>'"I don't know what you mean, sir. </span>
<span sid='45269' title='45269'>Ask the master about Master Godfrey. </span>
<span sid='45270' title='45270'>He knows. </span>
<span sid='45271' title='45271'>It is not for me to interfere."</span>
<p>
<span sid='45272' title='45272'>'He was leaving the room, but I held his arm.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45273' title='45273'>'"Listen," I said. </span>
<span sid='45274' title='45274'>"You are going to answer one question before you leave if I have to hold you all night. </span>
<span sid='45275' title='45275'>Is Godfrey dead?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='45276' title='45276'>'He could not face my eyes. </span>
<span sid='45277' title='45277'>He was like a man hypnotized. </span>
<span sid='45278' title='45278'>The answer was dragged from his lips. </span>
<span sid='45279' title='45279'>It was a terrible and unexpected one.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45280' title='45280'>'"I wish to God he was!" he cried, and, tearing himself free, he dashed from the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45281' title='45281'>'You will think, Mr Holmes, that I returned to my chair in no very happy state of mind. </span>
<span sid='45282' title='45282'>The old man's words seemed to me to bear only one interpretation. </span>
<span sid='45283' title='45283'>Clearly my poor friend had become involved in some criminal, or, at the least, disreputable, transaction which touched the family honour. </span>
<span sid='45284' title='45284'>That stern old man had sent his son away and hidden him from the world lest some scandal should come to light. </span>
<span sid='45285' title='45285'>Godfrey was a reckless fellow. </span>
<span sid='45286' title='45286'>He was easily influenced by those around him. </span>
<span sid='45287' title='45287'>No doubt he had fallen into bad hands and been misled to his ruin. </span>
<span sid='45288' title='45288'>It was a piteous business, if it was indeed so, but even now it was my duty to hunt him out and see if I could aid him. </span>
<span sid='45289' title='45289'>I was anxiously pondering the matter when I looked up, and there was Godfrey Emsworth standing before me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45290' title='45290'>My client had paused as one in deep emotion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45291' title='45291'>'Pray continue,' I said. </span>
<span sid='45292' title='45292'>'Your problem presents some very unusual features.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45293' title='45293'>'He was outside the window, Mr Holmes, with his face pressed against the glass. </span>
<span sid='45294' title='45294'>I have told you that I looked out at the night. </span>
<span sid='45295' title='45295'>When I did so, I left the curtains partly open. </span>
<span sid='45296' title='45296'>His figure was framed in this gap. </span>
<span sid='45297' title='45297'>The window came down to the ground and I could see the whole length of it, but it was his face which held my gaze. </span>
<span sid='45298' title='45298'>He was deadly pale-never have I seen a man so white. </span>
<span sid='45299' title='45299'>I reckon ghosts may look like that, but his eyes met mine, and they were the eyes of a living man. </span>
<span sid='45300' title='45300'>He sprang back when he saw that I was looking at him, and he vanished into the darkness.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45301' title='45301'>'There was something shocking about the man, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='45302' title='45302'>It wasn't merely that ghastly face glimmering as white as cheese in the darkness. </span>
<span sid='45303' title='45303'>It was more subtle than that-something slinking, something furtive, something guilty-something very unlike the frank, manly lad that I had known. </span>
<span sid='45304' title='45304'>It left a feeling of horror in my mind.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45305' title='45305'>'But when a man has been soldiering for a year or two with brother Boer as a playmate, he keeps his nerve and acts quickly. </span>
<span sid='45306' title='45306'>Godfrey had hardly vanished before I was at the window. </span>
<span sid='45307' title='45307'>There was an awkward catch, and I was some little time before I could throw it up. </span>
<span sid='45308' title='45308'>Then I nipped through and ran down the garden path in the direction that I thought he might have taken.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45309' title='45309'>'It was a long path and the light was not very good, but it seemed to me something was moving ahead of me. </span>
<span sid='45310' title='45310'>I ran on and called his name, but it was no use. </span>
<span sid='45311' title='45311'>When I got to the end of the path there were several others branching in different directions to various outhouses. </span>
<span sid='45312' title='45312'>I stood hesitating, and as I did so I heard distinctly the sound of a closing door. </span>
<span sid='45313' title='45313'>It was not behind me in the house, but ahead of me, somewhere in the darkness. </span>
<span sid='45314' title='45314'>That was enough, Mr Holmes, to assure me that what I had seen was not a vision. </span>
<span sid='45315' title='45315'>Godfrey had run away from me and he had shut a door behind him. </span>
<span sid='45316' title='45316'>Of that I was certain.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45317' title='45317'>'There was nothing more I could do, and I spent an uneasy night turning the matter over in my mind and trying to find some theory which would cover the facts. </span>
<span sid='45318' title='45318'>Next day I found the Colonel rather more conciliatory, and as his wife remarked that there were some places of interest in the neighbourhood, it gave me an opening to ask whether my presence for one more night would incommode them. </span>
<span sid='45319' title='45319'>A somewhat grudging acquiescence from the old man gave me a clear day in which to make my observations. </span>
<span sid='45320' title='45320'>I was already perfectly convinced that Godfrey was in hiding somewhere near, but where and why remained to be solved.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45321' title='45321'>'The house was so large and so rambling that a regiment might be hid away in it and no one the wiser. </span>
<span sid='45322' title='45322'>If the secret lay there, it was difficult for me to penetrate it. </span>
<span sid='45323' title='45323'>But the door which I had heard close was certainly not in the house. </span>
<span sid='45324' title='45324'>I must explore the garden and see what I could find. </span>
<span sid='45325' title='45325'>There was no difficulty in the way, for the old people were busy in their own fashion and left me to my own devices.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45326' title='45326'>'There were several small outhouses, but at the end of the garden there was a detached building of some size - large enough for a gardener's or a gamekeeper's residence. </span>
<span sid='45327' title='45327'>Could this be the place whence the sound of that shutting door had come? </span>
<span sid='45328' title='45328'>I approached it in a careless fashion, as though I were strolling aimlessly round the grounds. </span>
<span sid='45329' title='45329'>As I did so, a small, brisk, bearded man in a black coat and bowler hat-not at all the gardener type - came out of the door. </span>
<span sid='45330' title='45330'>To my surprise, he locked it after him and put the key in his pocket. </span>
<span sid='45331' title='45331'>Then he looked at me with some surprise on his face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45332' title='45332'>'"Are you a visitor here?" he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45333' title='45333'>'I explained that I was and that I was a friend of Godfrey's.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45334' title='45334'>'"What a pity that he should be away on his travels, for he would have so liked to see me," I continued.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45335' title='45335'>'"Quite so. </span>
<span sid='45336' title='45336'>Exactly," said he, with a rather guilty air. </span>
<span sid='45337' title='45337'>"No doubt you will renew your visit at some more propitious time." </span>
<span sid='45338' title='45338'>He passed on, but when I turned I observed that he was standing watching me, half-concealed by the laurels at the far end of the garden.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45339' title='45339'>'I had a good look at the little house as I passed it, but the windows were heavily curtained, and, so far as one could see, it was empty. </span>
<span sid='45340' title='45340'>I might spoil my own game, and even be ordered off the premises, if I were too audacious, for I was still conscious that I was being watched. </span>
<span sid='45341' title='45341'>Therefore, I strolled back to the house and waited for night before I went on with my inquiry. </span>
<span sid='45342' title='45342'>When all was dark and quiet, I slipped out of my window and made my way as silently as possible to the mysterious lodge.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45343' title='45343'>'I have said that it was heavily curtained, but now I found that the windows were shuttered as well. </span>
<span sid='45344' title='45344'>Some light, however, was breaking through one of them, so I concentrated my attention upon this. </span>
<span sid='45345' title='45345'>I was in luck, for the curtain had not been quite closed, and there was a crack in the shutter so that I could see the inside of the room. </span>
<span sid='45346' title='45346'>It was a cheery place enough, a bright lamp and a blazing fire. </span>
<span sid='45347' title='45347'>Opposite to me was seated the little man whom I had seen in the morning. </span>
<span sid='45348' title='45348'>He was smoking a pipe and reading a paper-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45349' title='45349'>'What paper?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45350' title='45350'>My client seemed annoyed at the interruption of his narrative.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45351' title='45351'>'Can it matter?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45352' title='45352'>'It is most essential.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45353' title='45353'>'I really took no notice.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45354' title='45354'>'Possibly you observed whether it was a broad-leafed paper or of that smaller type which one associates with weeklies.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45355' title='45355'>'Now that you mention it, it was not large. </span>
<span sid='45356' title='45356'>It might have been The Spectator. </span>
<span sid='45357' title='45357'>However, I had little thought to spare upon such details, for a second man was seated with his back to the window, and I could swear that this second man was Godfrey. </span>
<span sid='45358' title='45358'>I could not see his face, but I knew the familiar slope of his shoulders. </span>
<span sid='45359' title='45359'>He was leaning upon his elbow in an attitude of great melancholy, his body turned towards the fire. </span>
<span sid='45360' title='45360'>I was hesitating as to what I should do when there was a sharp tap on my shoulder, and there was Colonel Emsworth beside me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45361' title='45361'>'"This way, sir!" said he in a low voice. </span>
<span sid='45362' title='45362'>He walked in silence to the house and I followed him into my own bedroom. </span>
<span sid='45363' title='45363'>He had picked up a time-table in the hall.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45364' title='45364'>'"There is a train to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> at eight-thirty," said he. </span>
<span sid='45365' title='45365'>"The trap will be at the door at eight."</span>
<p>
<span sid='45366' title='45366'>'He was white with rage, and, indeed, I felt myself in so difficult a position that I could only stammer out a few incoherent apologies, in which I tried to excuse myself by urging my anxiety for my friend.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45367' title='45367'>'"The matter will not bear discussion," said he, abruptly. </span>
<span sid='45368' title='45368'>"You have made a most damnable intrusion into the privacy of our family. </span>
<span sid='45369' title='45369'>You were here as a guest and you have become a spy. </span>
<span sid='45370' title='45370'>I have nothing more to say, sir, save that I have no wish ever to see you again."</span>
<p>
<span sid='45371' title='45371'>'At this I lost my temper, Mr Holmes, and I spoke with some warmth.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45372' title='45372'>'"I have seen your son, and I am convinced that for some reason of your own you are concealing him from the world. </span>
<span sid='45373' title='45373'>I have no idea what your motives are in cutting him off in this fashion, but I am sure that he is no longer a free agent. </span>
<span sid='45374' title='45374'>I warn you, Colonel Emsworth, that until I am assured as to the safety and well-being of my friend I shall never desist in my efforts to get to the bottom of the mystery, and I shall certainly not allow myself to be intimidated by anything which you may say or do."</span>
<p>
<span sid='45375' title='45375'>'The old fellow looked diabolical, and I really thought he was about to attack me. </span>
<span sid='45376' title='45376'>I have said that he was a gaunt, fierce old giant, and though I am no weakling I might have been hard put to it to hold my own against him. </span>
<span sid='45377' title='45377'>However, after a long glare of rage he turned upon his heel and walked out of the room. </span>
<span sid='45378' title='45378'>For my part, I took the appointed train in the morning, with the full intention of coming straight to you and asking for your advice and assistance at the appointment for which I had already written.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45379' title='45379'>Such was the problem which my visitor laid before me. </span>
<span sid='45380' title='45380'>It presented, as the astute reader will have already perceived, few difficulties in its solution, for a very limited choice of alternatives must get to the root of the matter. </span>
<span sid='45381' title='45381'>Still, elementary as it was, there were points of interest and novelty about it which may excuse my placing it upon record. </span>
<span sid='45382' title='45382'>I now proceeded, using my familiar method of logical analysis, to narrow down the possible solutions.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45383' title='45383'>'The servants,' I asked, 'how many were in the house?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45384' title='45384'>'To the best of my belief there were only the old butler and his wife. </span>
<span sid='45385' title='45385'>They seemed to live in the simplest fashion.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45386' title='45386'>'There was no servant, then, in the detached house?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45387' title='45387'>'None, unless the little man with the beard acted as such. </span>
<span sid='45388' title='45388'>He seemed, however, to be quite a superior person.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45389' title='45389'>'That seems very suggestive. </span>
<span sid='45390' title='45390'>Had you any indication that food was conveyed from the one house to the other?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45391' title='45391'>'Now that you mention it, I did see old Ralph carrying a basket down the garden walk and going in the direction of this house. </span>
<span sid='45392' title='45392'>The idea of food did not occur to me at the moment.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45393' title='45393'>'Did you make any local inquiries?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45394' title='45394'>'Yes, I did. </span>
<span sid='45395' title='45395'>I spoke to the station-master and also to the innkeeper in the village. </span>
<span sid='45396' title='45396'>I simply asked if they knew anything of my old comrade, Godfrey Emsworth. </span>
<span sid='45397' title='45397'>Both of them assured me that he had gone for a voyage round the world. </span>
<span sid='45398' title='45398'>He had come home and then had almost at once started off again. </span>
<span sid='45399' title='45399'>The story was evidently universally accepted.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45400' title='45400'>'You said nothing of your suspicions?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45401' title='45401'>'Nothing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45402' title='45402'>'That was very wise. </span>
<span sid='45403' title='45403'>The matter should certainly be inquired into. </span>
<span sid='45404' title='45404'>I will go back with you to Tuxbury Old Park.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45405' title='45405'>'To-day?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45406' title='45406'>It happened that at the moment I was clearing up the case which my friend Watson has described as that of the Abbey School, in which the Duke of Greyminster was so deeply involved. </span>
<span sid='45407' title='45407'>I had also a commission from the Sultan of Turkey which called for immediate action, as political consequences of the gravest kind might arise from its neglect. </span>
<span sid='45408' title='45408'>Therefore it was not until the beginning of the next week, as my diary records, that I was able to start forth on my mission to Bedfordshire in company with Mr James M. Dodd. </span>
<span sid='45409' title='45409'>As we drove to Euston we picked up a grave and taciturn gentleman of iron-grey aspect, with whom I had made the necessary arrangements.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45410' title='45410'>'This is an old friend,' said I to Dodd. </span>
<span sid='45411' title='45411'>'It is possible that his presence may be entirely unnecessary, and, on the other hand, it may be essential. </span>
<span sid='45412' title='45412'>It is not necessary at the present stage to go further into the matter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45413' title='45413'>The narratives of Watson have accustomed the reader, no doubt, to the fact that I do not waste words or disclose my thoughts while a case is actually under consideration. </span>
<span sid='45414' title='45414'>Dodd seemed surprised, but nothing more was said and the three of us continued our journey together. </span>
<span sid='45415' title='45415'>In the train I asked Dodd one more question which I wished our companion to hear.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45416' title='45416'>'You say that you saw your friend's face quite clearly at the window, so clearly that you are sure of his identity?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45417' title='45417'>'I have no doubt about it whatever. </span>
<span sid='45418' title='45418'>His nose was pressed against the glass. </span>
<span sid='45419' title='45419'>The lamplight shone full upon him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45420' title='45420'>'It could not have been someone resembling him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45421' title='45421'>'No, no, it was he.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45422' title='45422'>'But you say he was changed?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45423' title='45423'>'Only in colour. </span>
<span sid='45424' title='45424'>His face was - how shall I describe it? - it was of a fish-belly whiteness. </span>
<span sid='45425' title='45425'>It was bleached.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45426' title='45426'>'Was it equally pale all over?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45427' title='45427'>'I think not. </span>
<span sid='45428' title='45428'>It was his brow which I saw so clearly as it was pressed against the window.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45429' title='45429'>'Did you call to him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45430' title='45430'>'I was too startled and horrified for the moment. </span>
<span sid='45431' title='45431'>Then I pursued him, as I have told you, but without result.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45432' title='45432'>My case was practically complete, and there was only one small incident needed to round it off. </span>
<span sid='45433' title='45433'>When, after a considerable drive, we arrived at the strange old rambling house which my client had described, it was Ralph, the elderly butler, who opened the door. </span>
<span sid='45434' title='45434'>I had requisitioned the carriage for the day and had asked my elderly friend to remain within it unless we should summon him. </span>
<span sid='45435' title='45435'>Ralph, a little wrinkled old fellow, was in the conventional costume of black coat and pepper-and-salt trousers, with only one curious variant. </span>
<span sid='45436' title='45436'>He wore brown leather gloves, which at sight of us he instantly shuffled off, laying them down on the hall table as we passed in. </span>
<span sid='45437' title='45437'>I have, as my friend Watson may have remarked, an abnormally acute set of senses, and a faint but incisive scent was apparent. </span>
<span sid='45438' title='45438'>It seemed to centre on the hall-table. </span>
<span sid='45439' title='45439'>I turned, placed my hat there, knocked it off, stooped to pick it up, and contrived to bring my nose within a foot of the gloves. </span>
<span sid='45440' title='45440'>Yes, it was undoubtedly from them that the curious tarry odour was oozing. </span>
<span sid='45441' title='45441'>I passed on into the study with my case complete. </span>
<span sid='45442' title='45442'>Alas, that I should have to show my hand so when I tell my own story! </span>
<span sid='45443' title='45443'>It was by concealing such links in the chain that Watson was enabled to produce his meretricious finales.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45444' title='45444'>Colonel Emsworth was not in his room, but he came quickly enough on receipt of Ralph's message. </span>
<span sid='45445' title='45445'>We heard his quick, heavy step in the passage. </span>
<span sid='45446' title='45446'>The door was flung open and he rushed in with bristling beard and twisted features, as terrible an old man as ever I have seen. </span>
<span sid='45447' title='45447'>He held our cards in his hand, and he tore them up and stamped on the fragments.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45448' title='45448'>'Have I not told you, you infernal busybody, that you are warned off the premises? </span>
<span sid='45449' title='45449'>Never dare to show your damned face here again. </span>
<span sid='45450' title='45450'>If you enter again without my leave I shall be within my rights if I use violence. </span>
<span sid='45451' title='45451'>I'll shoot you, sir! </span>
<span sid='45452' title='45452'>By God, I will! </span>
<span sid='45453' title='45453'>As to you, sir,' turning upon me, 'I extend the same warning to you. </span>
<span sid='45454' title='45454'>I am familiar with your ignoble profession, but you must take your reputed talents to some other field. </span>
<span sid='45455' title='45455'>There is no opening for them here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45456' title='45456'>'I cannot leave here,' said my client firmly, 'until I hear from Godfrey's own lips that he is under no restraint.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45457' title='45457'>Our involuntary host rang the bell.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45458' title='45458'>'Ralph,' he said, 'telephone down to the county police and ask the inspector to send up two constables. </span>
<span sid='45459' title='45459'>Tell him there are burglars in the house.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45460' title='45460'>'One moment,' said I. </span>
<span sid='45461' title='45461'>'You must be aware, Mr Dodd, that Colonel Emsworth is within his rights and that we have no legal status within his house. </span>
<span sid='45462' title='45462'>On the other hand, he should recognize that your action is prompted entirely by solicitude for his son. </span>
<span sid='45463' title='45463'>I venture to hope that, if I were allowed to have five minutes' conversation with Colonel Emsworth, I could certainly alter his view of the matter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45464' title='45464'>'I am not so easily altered,' said the old soldier. </span>
<span sid='45465' title='45465'>'Ralph, do what I have told you. </span>
<span sid='45466' title='45466'>What the devil are you waiting for? </span>
<span sid='45467' title='45467'>Ring up the police!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45468' title='45468'>'Nothing of the sort,' I said, putting my back to the door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45469' title='45469'>'Any police interference would bring about the very catastrophe which you dread.' </span>
<span sid='45470' title='45470'>I took out my notebook and scribbled one word upon a loose sheet. </span>
<span sid='45471' title='45471'>'That', said I, as I handed it to Colonel Emsworth, 'is what has brought us here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45472' title='45472'>He stared at the writing with a face from which every expression save amazement had vanished.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45473' title='45473'>'How do you know?' </span>
<span sid='45474' title='45474'>he gasped, sitting down heavily in his chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45475' title='45475'>'It is my business to know things. </span>
<span sid='45476' title='45476'>That is my trade.' </span>
<span sid='45477' title='45477'>He sat in deep thought, his gaunt hand tugging at his straggling beard. </span>
<span sid='45478' title='45478'>Then he made a gesture of resignation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45479' title='45479'>'Well, if you wish to see Godfrey, you shall. </span>
<span sid='45480' title='45480'>It is no doing of mine, but you have forced my hand. </span>
<span sid='45481' title='45481'>Ralph, tell Mr Godfrey and Mr <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kent&t=h'>Kent</a> that in five minutes we shall be with them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45482' title='45482'>At the end of that time we passed down the garden path and found ourselves in front of the mystery house at the end. </span>
<span sid='45483' title='45483'>A small bearded man stood at the door with a look of considerable astonishment upon his face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45484' title='45484'>'This is very sudden, Colonel Emsworth,' said he. </span>
<span sid='45485' title='45485'>'This will disarrange all our plans.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45486' title='45486'>'I can't help it, Mr <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kent&t=h'>Kent</a>. </span>
<span sid='45487' title='45487'>Our hands have been forced. </span>
<span sid='45488' title='45488'>Can Mr Godfrey see us?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45489' title='45489'>'Yes, he is waiting inside.' </span>
<span sid='45490' title='45490'>He turned and led us into a large, plainly furnished front room. </span>
<span sid='45491' title='45491'>A man was standing with his back to the fire, and at the sight of him my client sprang forward with outstretched hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45492' title='45492'>'Why, Godfrey, old man, this is fine!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45493' title='45493'>But the other waved him back.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45494' title='45494'>'Don't touch me, Jimmie. </span>
<span sid='45495' title='45495'>Keep your distance. </span>
<span sid='45496' title='45496'>Yes, you may well stare! </span>
<span sid='45497' title='45497'>I don't quite look the smart Lance-Corporal Emsworth, of B Squadron, do I?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45498' title='45498'>His appearance was certainly extraordinary. </span>
<span sid='45499' title='45499'>One could see that he had indeed been a handsome man with clear-cut features sunburned by an <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>n sun, but mottled in patches over this darker surface were curious whitish patches which had bleached his skin.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45500' title='45500'>'That's why I don't court visitors,' said he. </span>
<span sid='45501' title='45501'>'I don't mind you, Jimmie, but I could have done without your friend. </span>
<span sid='45502' title='45502'>I suppose there is some good reason for it, but you have me at a disadvantage.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45503' title='45503'>'I wanted to be sure that all was well with you, Godfrey. </span>
<span sid='45504' title='45504'>I saw you that night when you looked into my window, and I could not let the matter rest till I had cleared things up.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45505' title='45505'>'Old Ralph told me you were there, and I couldn't help taking a peep at you. </span>
<span sid='45506' title='45506'>I hoped you would not have seen me, and I had to run to my burrow when I heard the window go up.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45507' title='45507'>'But what in Heaven's name is the matter?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45508' title='45508'>'Well, it's not a long story to tell,' said he, lighting a cigarette. </span>
<span sid='45509' title='45509'>'You remember that morning fight at Buffelsspruit, outside Pretoria, on the Eastern railway line? </span>
<span sid='45510' title='45510'>You heard I was hit?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45511' title='45511'>'Yes, I heard that, but I never got particulars.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45512' title='45512'>'Three of us got separated from the others. </span>
<span sid='45513' title='45513'>It was very broken country, you may remember. </span>
<span sid='45514' title='45514'>There was Simpson - the fellow we called Baldy Simpson - and Anderson, and I. </span>
<span sid='45515' title='45515'>We were clearing brother Boer, but he lay low and got the three of us. </span>
<span sid='45516' title='45516'>The other two were killed. </span>
<span sid='45517' title='45517'>I got an elephant bullet through my shoulder. </span>
<span sid='45518' title='45518'>I stuck on to my horse, however, and he galloped several miles before I fainted and rolled off the saddle.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45519' title='45519'>'When I came to myself it was nightfall, and I raised myself up, feeling very weak and ill. </span>
<span sid='45520' title='45520'>To my surprise there was a house close behind me, a fairly large house with a broad stoep and many windows. </span>
<span sid='45521' title='45521'>It was deadly cold. </span>
<span sid='45522' title='45522'>You remember the kind of numb cold which used to come at evening, a deadly, sickening sort of cold, very different from a crisp healthy frost. </span>
<span sid='45523' title='45523'>Well, I was chilled to the bone, and my only hope seemed to lie in reaching that house. </span>
<span sid='45524' title='45524'>I staggered to my feet and dragged myself along, hardly conscious of what I did. </span>
<span sid='45525' title='45525'>I have a dim memory of slowly ascending the steps, entering a wide-opened door, passing into a large room which contained several beds, and throwing myself down with a gasp of satisfaction upon one of them. </span>
<span sid='45526' title='45526'>It was unmade, but that troubled me not at all. </span>
<span sid='45527' title='45527'>I drew the clothes over my shivering body and in a moment I was in a deep sleep.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45528' title='45528'>'It was morning when I wakened, and it seemed to me that instead of coming out into a world of sanity I had emerged into some extraordinary nightmare. </span>
<span sid='45529' title='45529'>The <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>n sun flooded through the big, curtainless windows, and every detail of the great, bare, whitewashed dormitory stood out hard and clear. </span>
<span sid='45530' title='45530'>In front of me was standing a small, dwarflike man with a huge, bulbous head, who was jabbering excitedly in Dutch, waving two horrible hands which looked to me like brown sponges. </span>
<span sid='45531' title='45531'>Behind him stood a group of people who seemed to be intensely amused by the situation, but a chill came over me as I looked at them. </span>
<span sid='45532' title='45532'>Not one of them was a normal human being. </span>
<span sid='45533' title='45533'>Every one was twisted or swollen or disfigured in some strange way. </span>
<span sid='45534' title='45534'>The laughter of these strange monstrosities was a dreadful thing to hear.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45535' title='45535'>'It seemed that none of them could speak English, but the situation wanted clearing up, for the creature with the big head was growing furiously angry and, uttering wild beast cries, he had laid his deformed hands upon me and was dragging me out of bed, regardless of the fresh flow of blood from my wound. </span>
<span sid='45536' title='45536'>The little monster was as strong as a bull, and I don't know what he might have done to me had not an elderly man who was clearly in authority been attracted to the room by the hubbub. </span>
<span sid='45537' title='45537'>He said a few stern words in Dutch and my persecutor shrank away. </span>
<span sid='45538' title='45538'>Then he turned upon me, gazing at me in the utmost amazement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45539' title='45539'>'"How in the world did you come here?" he asked, in amazement. </span>
<span sid='45540' title='45540'>"Wait a bit! </span>
<span sid='45541' title='45541'>I see that you are tired out and that wounded shoulder of yours wants looking after. </span>
<span sid='45542' title='45542'>I am a doctor, and I'll soon have you tied up. </span>
<span sid='45543' title='45543'>But, man alive! </span>
<span sid='45544' title='45544'>You are in far greater danger here than ever you were on the battlefield. </span>
<span sid='45545' title='45545'>You are in the Leper Hospital, and you have slept in a leper's bed."</span>
<p>
<span sid='45546' title='45546'>'Need I tell you more, Jimmie? </span>
<span sid='45547' title='45547'>It seems that in view of the approaching battle all these poor creatures had been evacuated the day before. </span>
<span sid='45548' title='45548'>Then, as the British advanced, they had been brought back by this, their medical superintendent, who assured me that, though he believed he was immune to the disease, he would none the less never have dared to do what I had done. </span>
<span sid='45549' title='45549'>He put me in a private room, treated me kindly, and within a week or so I was removed to the general hospital at Pretoria.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45550' title='45550'>'So there you have my tragedy. </span>
<span sid='45551' title='45551'>I hoped against hope, but it was not until I had reached home that the terrible signs which you see upon my face told me that I had not escaped. </span>
<span sid='45552' title='45552'>What was I to do? </span>
<span sid='45553' title='45553'>I was in this lonely house. </span>
<span sid='45554' title='45554'>We had two servants whom we could utterly trust. </span>
<span sid='45555' title='45555'>There was a house where I could live. </span>
<span sid='45556' title='45556'>Under pledge of secrecy, Mr <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kent&t=h'>Kent</a>, who is a surgeon, was prepared to stay with me. </span>
<span sid='45557' title='45557'>It seemed simple enough on those lines. </span>
<span sid='45558' title='45558'>The alternative was a dreadful one - segregation for life among strangers with never a hope of release. </span>
<span sid='45559' title='45559'>But absolute secrecy was necessary, or even in this quiet country-side there would have been an outcry, and I should have been dragged to my horrible doom. </span>
<span sid='45560' title='45560'>Even you, Jimmie - even you had to be kept in the dark. </span>
<span sid='45561' title='45561'>Why my father has relented I cannot imagine.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45562' title='45562'>Colonel Emsworth pointed to me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45563' title='45563'>'This is the gentleman who forced my hand.' </span>
<span sid='45564' title='45564'>He unfolded the scrap of paper on which I had written the word 'Leprosy'. </span>
<span sid='45565' title='45565'>'It seemed to me that if he knew so much as that it was safer that he should know all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45566' title='45566'>'And so it was,' said I. </span>
<span sid='45567' title='45567'>'Who knows but good may come of it? </span>
<span sid='45568' title='45568'>I understand that only Mr <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kent&t=h'>Kent</a> has seen the patient. </span>
<span sid='45569' title='45569'>May I ask, sir, if you are an authority on such complaints, which are, I understand, tropical or semi-tropical in their nature?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45570' title='45570'>'I have the ordinary knowledge of the educated medical man,' he observed, with some stiffness.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45571' title='45571'>'I have no doubt, sir, that you are fully competent, but I am sure that you will agree that in such a case a second opinion is valuable. </span>
<span sid='45572' title='45572'>You have avoided this, I understand, for fear that pressure should be put upon you to segregate the patient.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45573' title='45573'>'That is so,' said Colonel Emsworth.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45574' title='45574'>'I foresaw this situation,' I explained, 'and I have brought with me a friend whose discretion may absolutely be trusted. </span>
<span sid='45575' title='45575'>I was able once to do him a professional service, and he is ready to advise as a friend rather than as a specialist. </span>
<span sid='45576' title='45576'>His name is Sir James Saunders.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45577' title='45577'>The prospect of an interview with Lord Roberts would not have excited greater wonder and pleasure in a raw subaltern than was now reflected upon the face of Mr <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kent&t=h'>Kent</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45578' title='45578'>'I shall indeed be proud,' he murmured.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45579' title='45579'>'Then I will ask Sir James to step this way. </span>
<span sid='45580' title='45580'>He is at present in the carriage outside the door. </span>
<span sid='45581' title='45581'>Meanwhile, Colonel Emsworth, we may perhaps assemble in your study, where I could give the necessary explanations.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45582' title='45582'>And here it is that I miss my Watson. </span>
<span sid='45583' title='45583'>By cunning questions and ejaculations of wonder he could elevate my simple art, which is but systematized common sense, into a prodigy. </span>
<span sid='45584' title='45584'>When I tell my own story I have no such aid. </span>
<span sid='45585' title='45585'>And yet I will give my process of thought even as I gave it to my small audience, which included Godfrey's mother, in the study of Colonel Emsworth.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45586' title='45586'>'That process', said I, 'starts upon the supposition that when you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. </span>
<span sid='45587' title='45587'>It may well be that several explanations remain, in which case one tries test after test until one or other of them has a convincing amount of support. </span>
<span sid='45588' title='45588'>We will now apply this principle to the case in point. </span>
<span sid='45589' title='45589'>As it was first presented to me, there were three possible explanations of the seclusion or incarceration of this gentleman in an outhouse of his father's mansion. </span>
<span sid='45590' title='45590'>There was the explanation that he was in hiding for a crime, or that he was mad and that they wished to avoid an asylum, or that he had some disease which caused his segregation. </span>
<span sid='45591' title='45591'>I could think of no other adequate solutions. </span>
<span sid='45592' title='45592'>These, then, had to be sifted and balanced against each other.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45593' title='45593'>'The criminal solution would not bear inspection. </span>
<span sid='45594' title='45594'>No unsolved crime had been reported from that district. </span>
<span sid='45595' title='45595'>I was sure of that. </span>
<span sid='45596' title='45596'>If it were some crime not yet discovered, then clearly it would be to the interest of the family to get rid of the delinquent and send him abroad rather than keep him concealed at home. </span>
<span sid='45597' title='45597'>I could see no explanation for such a line of conduct.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45598' title='45598'>'Insanity was more plausible. </span>
<span sid='45599' title='45599'>The presence of the second person in the outhouse suggested a keeper. </span>
<span sid='45600' title='45600'>The fact that he locked the door when he came out strengthened the supposition and gave the idea of constraint. </span>
<span sid='45601' title='45601'>On the other hand, this constraint could not be severe or the young man could not have got loose and come down to have a look at his friend. </span>
<span sid='45602' title='45602'>You will remember, Mr Dodd, that I felt round for points, asking you, for example, about the paper which Mr <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kent&t=h'>Kent</a> was reading. </span>
<span sid='45603' title='45603'>Had it been The Lancet or The British Medical Journal it would have helped me. </span>
<span sid='45604' title='45604'>It is not illegal, however, to keep a lunatic upon private premises so long as there is a qualified person in attendance and the authorities have been duly notified. </span>
<span sid='45605' title='45605'>Why, then, all this desperate desire for secrecy? </span>
<span sid='45606' title='45606'>Once again I could not get the theory to fit the facts.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45607' title='45607'>'There remained the third possibility, into which, rare and unlikely as it was, everything seemed to fit. </span>
<span sid='45608' title='45608'>Leprosy is not uncommon in South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>. </span>
<span sid='45609' title='45609'>By some extraordinary chance this youth might have contracted it. </span>
<span sid='45610' title='45610'>His people would be placed in a very dreadful position, since they would desire to save him from segregation. </span>
<span sid='45611' title='45611'>Great secrecy would be needed to prevent rumours from getting about and subsequent interference by the authorities. </span>
<span sid='45612' title='45612'>A devoted medical man, if sufficiently paid, would easily be found to take charge of the sufferer. </span>
<span sid='45613' title='45613'>There would be no reason why the latter should not be allowed freedom after dark. </span>
<span sid='45614' title='45614'>Bleaching of the skin is a common result of the disease. </span>
<span sid='45615' title='45615'>The case was a strong one - so strong that I determined to act as if it were actually proved. </span>
<span sid='45616' title='45616'>When on arriving here I noticed that Ralph, who carries out the meals, had gloves which are impregnated with disinfectants, my last doubts were removed. </span>
<span sid='45617' title='45617'>A single word showed you, sir, that your secret was discovered, and if I wrote rather than said it, it was to prove to you that my discretion was to be trusted.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45618' title='45618'>I was finishing this little analysis of the case when the door was opened and the austere figure of the great dermatologist was ushered in. </span>
<span sid='45619' title='45619'>But for once his sphinx-like features had relaxed and there was a warm humanity in his eyes. </span>
<span sid='45620' title='45620'>He strode up to Colonel Emsworth and shook him by the hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45621' title='45621'>'It is often my lot to bring ill-tidings, and seldom good,' said he. </span>
<span sid='45622' title='45622'>'This occasion is the more welcome. </span>
<span sid='45623' title='45623'>It is not leprosy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45624' title='45624'>'What?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45625' title='45625'>'A well-marked case of pseudo-leprosy or ichthyosis, a scale-like affection of the skin, unsightly, obstinate, but possibly curable, and certainly non-infective. </span>
<span sid='45626' title='45626'>Yes, Mr Holmes, the coincidence is a remarkable one. </span>
<span sid='45627' title='45627'>But is it coincidence? </span>
<span sid='45628' title='45628'>Are there not subtle forces at work of which we know little? </span>
<span sid='45629' title='45629'>Are we assured that the apprehension, from which this young man has no doubt suffered terribly since his exposure to its contagion, may not produce a physical effect which simulates that which it fears? </span>
<span sid='45630' title='45630'>At any rate, I pledge my professional reputation - But the lady has fainted! </span>
<span sid='45631' title='45631'>I think that Mr <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kent&t=h'>Kent</a> had better be with her until she recovers from this joyous shock.'</span>
