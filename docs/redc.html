<p>
<span sid='37006' title='37006'>1</span>
<span sid='37007' title='37007'>'Well, Mrs Warren, I cannot see that you have any particular cause for uneasiness, nor do I understand why I, whose time is of some value, should interfere in the matter.</span>
<span sid='37008' title='37008'>I really have other things to engage me.' </span>
<span sid='37009' title='37009'>So spoke Sherlock Holmes, and turned back to the great scrap-book in which he was arranging and indexing some of his recent material.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37010' title='37010'>But the landlady had the pertinacity, and also the cunning, of her sex. </span>
<span sid='37011' title='37011'>She held her ground firmly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37012' title='37012'>'You arranged an affair for a lodger of mine last year,' she said - 'Mr Fairdale Hobbs.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37013' title='37013'>'Ah, yes - a simple matter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37014' title='37014'>'But he would never cease talking of it - your kindness, sir, and the way in which you brought light into the darkness. </span>
<span sid='37015' title='37015'>I remembered his words when I was in doubt and darkness myself. </span>
<span sid='37016' title='37016'>I know you could if you only would.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37017' title='37017'>Holmes was accessible upon the side of flattery, and also, to do him justice, upon the side of kindliness. </span>
<span sid='37018' title='37018'>The two forces made him lay down his gum-brush with a sigh of resignation and push back his chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37019' title='37019'>'Well, well, Mrs Warren, let us hear about it, then. </span>
<span sid='37020' title='37020'>You don't object to tobacco, I take it? </span>
<span sid='37021' title='37021'>Thank you, Watson - the matches! </span>
<span sid='37022' title='37022'>You are uneasy, as I understand, because your new lodger remains in his rooms and you cannot see him. </span>
<span sid='37023' title='37023'>Why, bless you, Mrs Warren, if I were your lodger you often would not see me for weeks on end.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37024' title='37024'>'No doubt, sir, but this is different. </span>
<span sid='37025' title='37025'>It frightens me, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='37026' title='37026'>I can't sleep for fright. </span>
<span sid='37027' title='37027'>To hear his quick step moving here and moving there from early morning to late at night, and yet never to catch so much as a glimpse of him - it's more than I can stand. </span>
<span sid='37028' title='37028'>My husband is as nervous over it as I am, but he is out at his work all day, while I get no rest from it. </span>
<span sid='37029' title='37029'>What is he hiding for? </span>
<span sid='37030' title='37030'>What has he done? </span>
<span sid='37031' title='37031'>Except for the girl, I am all alone in the house with him, and it's more than my nerves can stand.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37032' title='37032'>Holmes leaned forward and laid his long, thin fingers upon the woman's shoulder. </span>
<span sid='37033' title='37033'>He had an almost hypnotic power of soothing when he wished. </span>
<span sid='37034' title='37034'>The scared look faded from her eyes, and her agitated features smoothed into their usual commonplace. </span>
<span sid='37035' title='37035'>She sat down in the chair which he had indicated.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37036' title='37036'>'If I take it up I must understand every detail,' said he. </span>
<span sid='37037' title='37037'>'Take time to consider. </span>
<span sid='37038' title='37038'>The smallest point may be the most essential. </span>
<span sid='37039' title='37039'>You say that the man came ten days ago, and paid you for a fortnight's board and lodging?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37040' title='37040'>'He asked my terms, sir. </span>
<span sid='37041' title='37041'>I said fifty shillings a week. </span>
<span sid='37042' title='37042'>There is a small sitting-room and bedroom, and all complete, at the top of the house.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37043' title='37043'>'Well?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37044' title='37044'>'He said, "I'll pay you five pounds a week if I can have it on my own terms." </span>
<span sid='37045' title='37045'>I'm a poor woman, sir, and Mr Warren earns little, and the money meant much to me. </span>
<span sid='37046' title='37046'>He took out a ten-pound note, and he held it out to me then and there. </span>
<span sid='37047' title='37047'>"You can have the same every fortnight for a long time to come if you keep the terms," he said. </span>
<span sid='37048' title='37048'>"If not, I'll have no more to do with you."'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37049' title='37049'>'What were the terms?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37050' title='37050'>'Well, sir, they were that he was to have a key of the house. </span>
<span sid='37051' title='37051'>That was all right. </span>
<span sid='37052' title='37052'>Lodgers often have them. </span>
<span sid='37053' title='37053'>Also, that he was to be left entirely to himself, and never, upon any excuse, to be disturbed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37054' title='37054'>'Nothing wonderful in that, surely?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37055' title='37055'>'Not in reason, sir. </span>
<span sid='37056' title='37056'>But this is out of all reason. </span>
<span sid='37057' title='37057'>He has been there for ten days, and neither Mr Warren, nor I, nor the girl has once set eyes upon him. </span>
<span sid='37058' title='37058'>We can hear that quick step of his pacing up and down, up and down, night, morning, and noon, but except on that first night he has never once gone out of the house.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37059' title='37059'>'Oh, he went out the first night, did he?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37060' title='37060'>'Yes, sir, and returned very late - after we were all in bed. </span>
<span sid='37061' title='37061'>He told me after he had taken the rooms that he would do so, and asked me not to bar the door. </span>
<span sid='37062' title='37062'>I heard him come up the stair after midnight.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37063' title='37063'>'But his meals?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37064' title='37064'>'It was his particular direction that we should always, when he rang, leave his meal upon a chair outside his door. </span>
<span sid='37065' title='37065'>Then he rings again when he has finished, and we take it down from the same chair. </span>
<span sid='37066' title='37066'>If he wants anything else he prints it on a slip of paper and leaves it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37067' title='37067'>'Prints it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37068' title='37068'>'Yes, sir, prints it in pencil. </span>
<span sid='37069' title='37069'>Just the word, nothing more. </span>
<span sid='37070' title='37070'>Here's one I brought to show you - SOAP. </span>
<span sid='37071' title='37071'>Here's another - MATCH. </span>
<span sid='37072' title='37072'>This is one he left the first morning - DAILY GAZETTE. </span>
<span sid='37073' title='37073'>I leave that paper with his breakfast every morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37074' title='37074'>'Dear me, Watson,' said Holmes, staring with great curiosity at the slips of foolscap which the landlady had handed to him, 'this is certainly a little unusual. </span>
<span sid='37075' title='37075'>Seclusion I can understand, but why print? </span>
<span sid='37076' title='37076'>Printing is a clumsy process. </span>
<span sid='37077' title='37077'>Why not write? </span>
<span sid='37078' title='37078'>What would it suggest, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37079' title='37079'>'That he desired to conceal his handwriting.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37080' title='37080'>'But why? </span>
<span sid='37081' title='37081'>What can it matter to him that his landlady should have a word of his writing? </span>
<span sid='37082' title='37082'>Still, it may be as you say. </span>
<span sid='37083' title='37083'>Then, again, why such laconic messages?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37084' title='37084'>'I cannot imagine.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37085' title='37085'>'It opens a pleasing field for intelligent speculation. </span>
<span sid='37086' title='37086'>The words are written with a broad-pointed, violet-tinted pencil of a not unusual pattern. </span>
<span sid='37087' title='37087'>You will observe that the paper is torn away at the side here after the printing was done, so that the S of SOAP is partly gone. </span>
<span sid='37088' title='37088'>Suggestive, Watson, is it not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37089' title='37089'>'Of caution?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37090' title='37090'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='37091' title='37091'>There was evidently some mark, some thumbprint, something which might give a clue to the person's identity. </span>
<span sid='37092' title='37092'>Now, Mrs Warren, you say that the man was of middle size, dark, and bearded. </span>
<span sid='37093' title='37093'>What age would he be?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37094' title='37094'>'Youngish, sir - not over thirty.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37095' title='37095'>'Well, can you give me no further indications?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37096' title='37096'>'He spoke good English, sir, and yet I thought he was a foreigner by his accent.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37097' title='37097'>'And he was well dressed?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37098' title='37098'>'Very smartly dressed, sir - quite the gentleman. </span>
<span sid='37099' title='37099'>Dark clothes - nothing you would note.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37100' title='37100'>'He gave no name?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37101' title='37101'>'No, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37102' title='37102'>'And has had no letters or callers?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37103' title='37103'>'None.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37104' title='37104'>'But surely you or the girl enter his room of a morning?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37105' title='37105'>'No, sir, he looks after himself entirely.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37106' title='37106'>'Dear me! that is certainly remarkable. </span>
<span sid='37107' title='37107'>What about his luggage?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37108' title='37108'>'He had one big brown bag with him - nothing else.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37109' title='37109'>'Well, we don't seem to have much material to help us. </span>
<span sid='37110' title='37110'>Do you say nothing has come out of that room - absolutely nothing?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37111' title='37111'>The landlady drew an envelope from her bag, from it she shook out two burnt matches and a cigarette-end upon the table.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37112' title='37112'>'They were on his tray this morning. </span>
<span sid='37113' title='37113'>I brought them because I had heard that you can read great things out of small ones.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37114' title='37114'>Holmes shrugged his shoulders.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37115' title='37115'>'There is nothing here,' said he. </span>
<span sid='37116' title='37116'>'The matches have, of course, been used to light cigarettes. </span>
<span sid='37117' title='37117'>That is obvious from the shortness of the burnt end. </span>
<span sid='37118' title='37118'>Half the match is consumed in fighting a pipe or cigar. </span>
<span sid='37119' title='37119'>But, dear me! </span>
<span sid='37120' title='37120'>this cigarette stub is certainly remarkable. </span>
<span sid='37121' title='37121'>The gentleman was bearded and moustached, you say?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37122' title='37122'>'Yes, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37123' title='37123'>'I don't understand that. </span>
<span sid='37124' title='37124'>I should say that only a cleanshaven man could have smoked this. </span>
<span sid='37125' title='37125'>Why, Watson, even your modest moustache would have been singed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37126' title='37126'>'A holder?' I suggested.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37127' title='37127'>'No, no, the end is matted. </span>
<span sid='37128' title='37128'>I suppose there could not be two people in your rooms, Mrs Warren?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37129' title='37129'>'No, sir. </span>
<span sid='37130' title='37130'>He eats so little that I often wonder it can keep life in one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37131' title='37131'>'Well, I think we must wait for a little more material. </span>
<span sid='37132' title='37132'>After all, you have nothing to complain of. </span>
<span sid='37133' title='37133'>You have received your rent, and he is not a troublesome lodger, though he is certainly an unusual one. </span>
<span sid='37134' title='37134'>He pays you well, and if he chooses to lie concealed it is no direct business of yours. </span>
<span sid='37135' title='37135'>We have no excuse for an intrusion upon his privacy until we have some reason to think that there is a guilty reason for it. </span>
<span sid='37136' title='37136'>I've taken up the matter, and I won't lose sight of it. </span>
<span sid='37137' title='37137'>Report to me if anything fresh occurs, and rely upon my assistance if it should be needed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37138' title='37138'>'There are certainly some points of interest in this case, Watson,' he remarked, when the landlady had left us. </span>
<span sid='37139' title='37139'>'It may, of course, be trivial - individual eccentricity, or it may be very much deeper than appears on the surface. </span>
<span sid='37140' title='37140'>The first thing that strikes one is the obvious possibility that the person now in the rooms may be entirely different from the one who engaged them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37141' title='37141'>'Why should you think so?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37142' title='37142'>'Well, apart from this cigarette-end, was it not suggestive that the only time the lodger went out was immediately after his taking the rooms? </span>
<span sid='37143' title='37143'>He came back - or someone came back-when all witnesses were out of the way. </span>
<span sid='37144' title='37144'>We have no proof that the person who came back was the person who went out. </span>
<span sid='37145' title='37145'>Then, again, the man who took the rooms spoke English well. </span>
<span sid='37146' title='37146'>This other, however, prints "match" when it should have been "matches". </span>
<span sid='37147' title='37147'>I can imagine that the word was taken out of a dictionary, which would give the noun but not the plural. </span>
<span sid='37148' title='37148'>The laconic style may be to conceal the absence of knowledge of English. </span>
<span sid='37149' title='37149'>Yes, Watson, there are good reasons to suspect that there has been a substitution of lodgers.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37150' title='37150'>'But for what possible end?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37151' title='37151'>'Ah! there lies our problem. </span>
<span sid='37152' title='37152'>There is one rather obvious line of investigation.' </span>
<span sid='37153' title='37153'>He took down the great book in which, day by day, he filed the agony columns of the various <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> journals. </span>
<span sid='37154' title='37154'>'Dear me!' said he, turning over the pages, 'what a chorus of groans, cries, and bleatings! </span>
<span sid='37155' title='37155'>What a rag-bag of singular happenings! </span>
<span sid='37156' title='37156'>But surely the most valuable hunting-ground that ever was given to a student of the unusual! </span>
<span sid='37157' title='37157'>This person is alone, and cannot be approached by letter without a breach of that absolute secrecy which is desired. </span>
<span sid='37158' title='37158'>How is any news or any message to reach him from without? </span>
<span sid='37159' title='37159'>Obviously by advertisement through a newspaper. </span>
<span sid='37160' title='37160'>There seems no other way, and fortunately we need concern ourselves with the one paper only. </span>
<span sid='37161' title='37161'>Here are the Daily Gazette extracts of the last fortnight. </span>
<span sid='37162' title='37162'>"Lady with a black boa at Prince's Skating Club" - that we may pass. </span>
<span sid='37163' title='37163'>"Surely Jimmy will not break his mother's heart" - that appears to be irrelevant. </span>
<span sid='37164' title='37164'>"If the lady who fainted in the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a> bus" - she does not interest me. </span>
<span sid='37165' title='37165'>"Every day my heart longs-" Bleat, Watson - unmitigated bleat!. </span>
<span sid='37166' title='37166'>Ah! this is a little more possible. </span>
<span sid='37167' title='37167'>Listen to this: "Be patient. </span>
<span sid='37168' title='37168'>Will find some sure means of communication. </span>
<span sid='37169' title='37169'>Meanwhile, this column. </span>
<span sid='37170' title='37170'>- G." </span>
<span sid='37171' title='37171'>That is two days after Mrs Warren's lodger arrived. </span>
<span sid='37172' title='37172'>It sounds plausible, does it not? </span>
<span sid='37173' title='37173'>The mysterious one could understand English, even if he could not print it. </span>
<span sid='37174' title='37174'>Let us see if we can pick up the trace again. </span>
<span sid='37175' title='37175'>Yes, here we are - three days later. </span>
<span sid='37176' title='37176'>"Am making successful arrangements. </span>
<span sid='37177' title='37177'>Patience and prudence. </span>
<span sid='37178' title='37178'>The clouds will pass. </span>
<span sid='37179' title='37179'>- G." </span>
<span sid='37180' title='37180'>Nothing for a week after that. </span>
<span sid='37181' title='37181'>Then comes something much more definite: "The path is clearing. </span>
<span sid='37182' title='37182'>If I find chance signal message remember code agreed - one A, two B, and so on. </span>
<span sid='37183' title='37183'>You will hear soon. </span>
<span sid='37184' title='37184'>- G." </span>
<span sid='37185' title='37185'>That was in yesterday's paper, and there is nothing in to-day's. </span>
<span sid='37186' title='37186'>It's all very appropriate to Mrs Warren's lodger. </span>
<span sid='37187' title='37187'>If we wait a little, Watson, I don't doubt that the affair will grow more intelligible.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37188' title='37188'>So it proved, for in the morning I found my friend standing on the hearthrug with his back to the fire, and a smile of complete satisfaction upon his face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37189' title='37189'>'How's this, Watson?' he cried, picking up the paper from the table. </span>
<span sid='37190' title='37190'>'"High red house with white stone facings. </span>
<span sid='37191' title='37191'>Third floor. </span>
<span sid='37192' title='37192'>Second window left. </span>
<span sid='37193' title='37193'>After dusk. </span>
<span sid='37194' title='37194'>- G." </span>
<span sid='37195' title='37195'>That is definite enough. </span>
<span sid='37196' title='37196'>I think after breakfast we must make a little reconnaissance of Mrs Warren's neighbourhood. </span>
<span sid='37197' title='37197'>Ah, Mrs Warren! what news do you bring us this morning?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37198' title='37198'>Our client had suddenly burst into the room with an explosive energy which told of some new and momentous development.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37199' title='37199'>'It's a police matter, Mr Holmes!' she cried. </span>
<span sid='37200' title='37200'>'I'll have no more of it! </span>
<span sid='37201' title='37201'>He shall pack out of that with his baggage. </span>
<span sid='37202' title='37202'>I would have gone straight up and told him so, only I thought it was but fair to you to take your opinion first. </span>
<span sid='37203' title='37203'>But I'm at the end of my patience, and when it comes to knocking my old man about-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37204' title='37204'>'Knocking Mr Warren about?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37205' title='37205'>'Using him roughly, anyway.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37206' title='37206'>'But who used him roughly?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37207' title='37207'>'Ah! that's what we want to know! </span>
<span sid='37208' title='37208'>It was this morning, sir. </span>
<span sid='37209' title='37209'>Mr Warren is a time-keeper at Morton and Waylight's, in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Tottenham Court Road&t=h'>Tottenham Court Road</a>. </span>
<span sid='37210' title='37210'>He has to be out of the house before seven. </span>
<span sid='37211' title='37211'>Well, this morning he had not got ten paces down the road when two men came up behind him, threw a coat over his head, and bundled him into a cab that was beside the kerb. </span>
<span sid='37212' title='37212'>They drove him an hour, and then opened the door and shot him out. </span>
<span sid='37213' title='37213'>He lay in the roadway so shaken in his wits that he never saw what became of the cab. </span>
<span sid='37214' title='37214'>When he picked himself up he found he was on <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Hampstead&t=h'>Hampstead</a> Heath, so he took a bus home, and there he lies now on the sofa, while I came straight round to tell you what had happened.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37215' title='37215'>'Most interesting,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='37216' title='37216'>'Did he observe the appearance of these men - did he hear them talk?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37217' title='37217'>'No, he is clean dazed. </span>
<span sid='37218' title='37218'>He just knows that he was lifted up as if by magic and dropped as if by magic. </span>
<span sid='37219' title='37219'>Two at least were in it, and maybe three.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37220' title='37220'>'And you connect this attack with your lodger?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37221' title='37221'>'Well, we've lived there fifteen years and no such happenings ever came before. </span>
<span sid='37222' title='37222'>I've had enough of him. </span>
<span sid='37223' title='37223'>Money's not everything. </span>
<span sid='37224' title='37224'>I'll have him out of my house before the day is done.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37225' title='37225'>'Wait a bit, Mrs Warren. </span>
<span sid='37226' title='37226'>Do nothing rash. </span>
<span sid='37227' title='37227'>I begin to think that this affair may be very much more important than appeared at first sight. </span>
<span sid='37228' title='37228'>It is clear now that some danger is threatening your lodger. </span>
<span sid='37229' title='37229'>It is equally clear that his enemies, lying in wait for him near your door, mistook your husband for him in the foggy morning fight. </span>
<span sid='37230' title='37230'>On discovering their mistake they released him. </span>
<span sid='37231' title='37231'>What they would have done had it not been a mistake, we can only conjecture.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37232' title='37232'>'Well, what am I to do, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37233' title='37233'>'I have a great fancy to see this lodger of yours, Mrs Warren.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37234' title='37234'>'I don't see how that is to be managed, unless you break in the door. </span>
<span sid='37235' title='37235'>I always hear him unlock it as I go down the stair after I leave the tray.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37236' title='37236'>'He has to take the tray in. </span>
<span sid='37237' title='37237'>Surely we could conceal ourselves and see him do it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37238' title='37238'>The landlady thought for a moment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37239' title='37239'>'Well, sir, there's the box-room opposite. </span>
<span sid='37240' title='37240'>I could arrange a looking-glass, maybe, and if you were behind the door-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37241' title='37241'>'Excellent!' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='37242' title='37242'>'When does he lunch?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37243' title='37243'>'About one, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37244' title='37244'>'Then Dr Watson and I will come round in time. </span>
<span sid='37245' title='37245'>For the present, Mrs Warren, good-bye.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37246' title='37246'>At half-past twelve we found ourselves upon the steps of Mrs Warren's house - a high, thin, yellow-brick edifice in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Great Orme Street&t=h'>Great Orme Street</a>, a narrow thoroughfare at the north-east side of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the British Museum&t=h'>the British Museum</a>. </span>
<span sid='37247' title='37247'>Standing as it does near the corner of the street, it commands a view down Howe Street, with its more pretentious houses. </span>
<span sid='37248' title='37248'>Holmes pointed with a chuckle to one of these, a row of residential flats, which projected so that they could not fail to catch the eye.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37249' title='37249'>'See, Watson!' said he. </span>
<span sid='37250' title='37250'>'"High red house with stone facings." </span>
<span sid='37251' title='37251'>There is the signal station all right. </span>
<span sid='37252' title='37252'>We know the place, and we know the code, so surely our task should be simple. </span>
<span sid='37253' title='37253'>There's a "To Let" card in that window. </span>
<span sid='37254' title='37254'>It is evidently an empty flat to which the confederate has access. </span>
<span sid='37255' title='37255'>Well, Mrs Warren, what now?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37256' title='37256'>'I have it all ready for you. </span>
<span sid='37257' title='37257'>If you will both come up and leave your boots below on the landing, I'll put you there now.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37258' title='37258'>It was an excellent hiding-place which she had arranged. </span>
<span sid='37259' title='37259'>The mirror was so placed that, seated in the dark, we could very plainly see the door opposite. </span>
<span sid='37260' title='37260'>We had hardly settled down in it, and Mrs Warren left us, when a distant tinkle announced that our mysterious neighbour had rung. </span>
<span sid='37261' title='37261'>Presently the landlady appeared with the tray, laid it down upon a chair beside the closed door, and then, treading heavily, departed. </span>
<span sid='37262' title='37262'>Crouching together in the angle of the door, we kept our eyes fixed upon the mirror. </span>
<span sid='37263' title='37263'>Suddenly, as the landlady's footsteps died away, there was the creak of a turning key, the handle revolved, and two thin hands darted out and lifted the tray from the chair. </span>
<span sid='37264' title='37264'>An instant later it was hurriedly replaced, and I caught a glimpse of a dark, beautiful, horrified face glaring at the narrow opening of the box-room. </span>
<span sid='37265' title='37265'>Then the door crashed to, the key turned once more, and all was silence. </span>
<span sid='37266' title='37266'>Holmes twitched my sleeve, and together we stole down the stair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37267' title='37267'>'I will call again in the evening,' said he to the expectant landlady. </span>
<span sid='37268' title='37268'>'I think, Watson, we can discuss this business better in our own quarters.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37269' title='37269'>'My surmise, as you saw, proved to be correct,' said he, speaking from the depths of his easy-chair. </span>
<span sid='37270' title='37270'>'There has been a substitution of lodgers. </span>
<span sid='37271' title='37271'>What I did not foresee is that we should find a woman, and no ordinary woman, Watson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37272' title='37272'>'She saw us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37273' title='37273'>'Well, she saw something to alarm her. </span>
<span sid='37274' title='37274'>That is certain. </span>
<span sid='37275' title='37275'>The general sequence of events is pretty clear, is it not? </span>
<span sid='37276' title='37276'>A couple seek refuge in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> from a very terrible and instant danger. </span>
<span sid='37277' title='37277'>The measure of that danger is the rigour of their precautions. </span>
<span sid='37278' title='37278'>The man, who has some work which he must do, desires to leave the woman in absolute safety while he does it. </span>
<span sid='37279' title='37279'>It is not an easy problem, but he solved it in an original fashion, and so effectively that her presence was not even known to the landlady who supplies her with food. </span>
<span sid='37280' title='37280'>The printed messages, as is now evident, were to prevent her sex being discovered by her writing. </span>
<span sid='37281' title='37281'>The man cannot come near the woman, or he will guide their enemies to her. </span>
<span sid='37282' title='37282'>Since he cannot communicate with her direct, he has recourse to the agony column of a paper. </span>
<span sid='37283' title='37283'>So far all is clear.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37284' title='37284'>'But what is at the root of it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37285' title='37285'>'Ah, yes, Watson - severely practical, as usual! </span>
<span sid='37286' title='37286'>What is at the root of it all? </span>
<span sid='37287' title='37287'>Mrs Warren's whimsical problem enlarges somewhat and assumes a more sinister aspect as we proceed. </span>
<span sid='37288' title='37288'>This much we can say: that it is no ordinary love escapade. </span>
<span sid='37289' title='37289'>You saw the woman's face at the sign of danger. </span>
<span sid='37290' title='37290'>We have heard, too, of the attack upon the landlord, which was undoubtedly meant for the lodger. </span>
<span sid='37291' title='37291'>These alarms, and the desperate need for secrecy, argue that the matter is one of life or death. </span>
<span sid='37292' title='37292'>The attack upon Mr Warren further shows that the enemy, whoever they are, are themselves not aware of the substitution of the female lodger for the male. </span>
<span sid='37293' title='37293'>It is very curious and complex, Watson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37294' title='37294'>'Why should you go further in it? </span>
<span sid='37295' title='37295'>What have you to gain from it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37296' title='37296'>'What indeed? </span>
<span sid='37297' title='37297'>It is Art for Art's sake, Watson. </span>
<span sid='37298' title='37298'>I suppose when you doctored you found yourself studying cases without thought of a fee?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37299' title='37299'>'For my education, Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37300' title='37300'>'Education never ends, Watson. </span>
<span sid='37301' title='37301'>It is a series of lessons with the greatest for the last. </span>
<span sid='37302' title='37302'>This is an instructive case. </span>
<span sid='37303' title='37303'>There is neither money nor credit in it, and yet one would wish to tidy it up. </span>
<span sid='37304' title='37304'>When dusk comes we should find ourselves one stage advanced in our investigation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37305' title='37305'>When we returned to Mrs Warren's rooms, the gloom of a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> winter evening had thickened into one grey curtain, a dead monotone of colour, broken only by the sharp yellow squares of the windows and the blurred haloes of the gas-lamps. </span>
<span sid='37306' title='37306'>As we peered from the darkened sitting-room of the lodging-house, one more dim light glimmered high up through the obscurity.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37307' title='37307'>'Someone is moving in that room,' said Holmes in a whisper, his gaunt and eager face thrust forward to the window-pane. </span>
<span sid='37308' title='37308'>'Yes, I can see his shadow. </span>
<span sid='37309' title='37309'>There he is again! </span>
<span sid='37310' title='37310'>He has a candle in his hand. </span>
<span sid='37311' title='37311'>Now he is peering across. </span>
<span sid='37312' title='37312'>He wants to be sure that she is on the look-out. </span>
<span sid='37313' title='37313'>Now he begins to flash. </span>
<span sid='37314' title='37314'>Take the message also, Watson, that we may check each other. </span>
<span sid='37315' title='37315'>A single flash - that is A, surely. </span>
<span sid='37316' title='37316'>Now, then. </span>
<span sid='37317' title='37317'>How many did you make it? </span>
<span sid='37318' title='37318'>Twenty. </span>
<span sid='37319' title='37319'>So did I. </span>
<span sid='37320' title='37320'>That should mean T. AT - that's intelligible enough! </span>
<span sid='37321' title='37321'>Another T. </span>
<span sid='37322' title='37322'>Surely this is the beginning of a second word. </span>
<span sid='37323' title='37323'>Now, then - TENTA. </span>
<span sid='37324' title='37324'>Dead stop. </span>
<span sid='37325' title='37325'>That can't be all, Watson? </span>
<span sid='37326' title='37326'>ATTENTA gives no sense. </span>
<span sid='37327' title='37327'>Nor is it any better as three words - AT. TEN. TA, unless T. A. are a person's initials. </span>
<span sid='37328' title='37328'>There it goes again! </span>
<span sid='37329' title='37329'>What's that? </span>
<span sid='37330' title='37330'>ATTE - why, it is the same message over again. </span>
<span sid='37331' title='37331'>Curious, Watson, very curious! </span>
<span sid='37332' title='37332'>Now he is off once more! </span>
<span sid='37333' title='37333'>AT - why, he is repeating it for the third time. </span>
<span sid='37334' title='37334'>ATTENTA three times! </span>
<span sid='37335' title='37335'>How often will he repeat it? </span>
<span sid='37336' title='37336'>No, that seems to be the finish. </span>
<span sid='37337' title='37337'>He has withdrawn from the window. </span>
<span sid='37338' title='37338'>What do you make of it, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37339' title='37339'>'A cipher message, Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37340' title='37340'>My companion gave a sudden chuckle of comprehension. </span>
<span sid='37341' title='37341'>'And not a very obscure cipher, Watson,' said he. </span>
<span sid='37342' title='37342'>'Why, of course, it is Italian! </span>
<span sid='37343' title='37343'>That A means that it is addressed to a woman. </span>
<span sid='37344' title='37344'>"Beware! </span>
<span sid='37345' title='37345'>Beware! </span>
<span sid='37346' title='37346'>Beware!" </span>
<span sid='37347' title='37347'>How's that, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37348' title='37348'>'I believe you have hit it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37349' title='37349'>'Not a doubt of it. </span>
<span sid='37350' title='37350'>It is a very urgent message, thrice repeated to make it more so. </span>
<span sid='37351' title='37351'>But beware of what? </span>
<span sid='37352' title='37352'>Wait a bit, he is coming to the window once more.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37353' title='37353'>Again we saw the dim silhouette of a crouching man and the whisk of the small flame across the window, as the signals were renewed. </span>
<span sid='37354' title='37354'>They came more rapidly than before - so rapid that it was hard to follow them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37355' title='37355'>'PERICOLO - Pericolo - Eh, what's that, Watson? </span>
<span sid='37356' title='37356'>Danger, isn't it? </span>
<span sid='37357' title='37357'>Yes, by Jove, it's a danger signal. </span>
<span sid='37358' title='37358'>There he goes again! </span>
<span sid='37359' title='37359'>PERI. </span>
<span sid='37360' title='37360'>Hullo, what on earth-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37361' title='37361'>The light had suddenly gone out, the glimmering square of window had disappeared, and the third floor formed a dark band round the lofty building, with its tiers of shining casements. </span>
<span sid='37362' title='37362'>That last warning cry had been suddenly cut short. </span>
<span sid='37363' title='37363'>How, and by whom? </span>
<span sid='37364' title='37364'>The same thought occurred on the instant to us both. </span>
<span sid='37365' title='37365'>Holmes sprang up from where he crouched by the window.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37366' title='37366'>'This is serious, Watson,' he cried. </span>
<span sid='37367' title='37367'>'There is some devilry going forward! </span>
<span sid='37368' title='37368'>Why should such a message stop in such a way? </span>
<span sid='37369' title='37369'>I should put <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a> in touch with this business - and yet, it is too pressing for us to leave.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37370' title='37370'>'Shall I go for the police?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37371' title='37371'>'We must define the situation a little more clearly. </span>
<span sid='37372' title='37372'>It may bear some more innocent interpretation. </span>
<span sid='37373' title='37373'>Come, Watson, let us go across ourselves and see what we can make of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37374' title='37374'>2</span>
<span sid='37375' title='37375'>As we walked rapidly down Howe Street I glanced back at the building which we had left. </span>
<span sid='37376' title='37376'>There, dimly outlined at the top window, I could see the shadow of a head, a woman's head, gazing tensely, rigidly, out into the night, waiting with breathless suspense for the renewal of that interrupted message. </span>
<span sid='37377' title='37377'>At the doorway of the Howe Street flats a man, muffled in a cravat and great-coat, was leaning against the railing. </span>
<span sid='37378' title='37378'>He started as the hall-light fell upon our faces.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37379' title='37379'>'Holmes!' he cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37380' title='37380'>'Why, Gregson!' said my companion, as he shook hands with the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a> detective. </span>
<span sid='37381' title='37381'>'Journeys end with lovers' meetings. </span>
<span sid='37382' title='37382'>What brings you here?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37383' title='37383'>'The same reasons that bring you, I expect,' said Gregson. </span>
<span sid='37384' title='37384'>'How you got on to it I can't imagine.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37385' title='37385'>'Different threads, but leading up to the same tangle. </span>
<span sid='37386' title='37386'>I've been taking the signals.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37387' title='37387'>'Signals?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37388' title='37388'>'Yes, from that window. </span>
<span sid='37389' title='37389'>They broke off in the middle. </span>
<span sid='37390' title='37390'>We came over to see the reason. </span>
<span sid='37391' title='37391'>But since it is safe in your hands I see no object in continuing the business.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37392' title='37392'>'Wait a bit!' cried Gregson, eagerly. </span>
<span sid='37393' title='37393'>'I'll do you this justice, Mr Holmes, that I was never in a case yet that I didn't feel stronger for having you on my side. </span>
<span sid='37394' title='37394'>There's only the one exit to these flats, so we have him safe.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37395' title='37395'>'Who is he?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37396' title='37396'>'Well, well, we score over you for once, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='37397' title='37397'>You must give us best this time.' </span>
<span sid='37398' title='37398'>He struck his stick sharply upon the ground, on which a cabman, his whip in his hand, sauntered over from a four-wheeler which stood on the far side of the street. </span>
<span sid='37399' title='37399'>'May I introduce you to Mr Sherlock Holmes?' he said to the cabman. </span>
<span sid='37400' title='37400'>'This is Mr Leverton, of Pinkerton's <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n Agency.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37401' title='37401'>'The hero of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Long Island&t=h'>Long Island</a> Cove mystery?' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='37402' title='37402'>'Sir, I am pleased to meet you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37403' title='37403'>The <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n, a quiet, businesslike young man, with a clean-shaven, hatchet face, flushed up at the words of commendation. </span>
<span sid='37404' title='37404'>'I am on the trail of my life now, Mr Holmes,' said he. </span>
<span sid='37405' title='37405'>'If I can get Gorgiano-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37406' title='37406'>'What! </span>
<span sid='37407' title='37407'>Gorgiano of the Red Circle?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37408' title='37408'>'Oh, he has a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>an fame, has he? </span>
<span sid='37409' title='37409'>Well, we've learned all about him in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>. </span>
<span sid='37410' title='37410'>We know he is at the bottom of fifty murders, and yet we have nothing positive we can take him on. </span>
<span sid='37411' title='37411'>I tracked him over from New <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=York&t=h'>York</a>, and I've been close to him for a week in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, waiting for some excuse to get my hand on his collar. </span>
<span sid='37412' title='37412'>Mr Gregson and I ran him to ground in that big tenement house, and there's only the one door, so he can't slip us. </span>
<span sid='37413' title='37413'>There's three folk come out since he went in, but I'll swear he wasn't one of them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37414' title='37414'>'Mr Holmes talks of signals,' said Gregson. </span>
<span sid='37415' title='37415'>'I expect, as usual, he knows a good deal that we don't.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37416' title='37416'>In a few clear words Holmes explained the situation as it had appeared to us. </span>
<span sid='37417' title='37417'>The <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n struck his hands together with vexation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37418' title='37418'>'He's on to us!' he cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37419' title='37419'>'Why do you think so?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37420' title='37420'>'Well, it figures out that way, does it not? </span>
<span sid='37421' title='37421'>Here he is, sending out messages to an accomplice - there are several of his gang in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='37422' title='37422'>Then suddenly, just as by your own account he was telling them that there was danger, he broke short off. </span>
<span sid='37423' title='37423'>What could it mean except that from the window he had suddenly either caught sight of us in the street, or in some way come to understand how close the danger was, and that he must act right away if he was to avoid it? </span>
<span sid='37424' title='37424'>What do you suggest, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37425' title='37425'>'That we go up at once and see for ourselves.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37426' title='37426'>'But we have no warrant for his arrest.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37427' title='37427'>'He is in unoccupied premises under suspicious circumstances,' said Gregson. </span>
<span sid='37428' title='37428'>'That is good enough for the moment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37429' title='37429'>When we have him by the heels we can see if New <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=York&t=h'>York</a> can't help us to keep him. </span>
<span sid='37430' title='37430'>I'll take the responsibility of arresting him now.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37431' title='37431'>Our official detectives may blunder in the matter of intelligence, but never in that of courage. </span>
<span sid='37432' title='37432'>Gregson climbed the stair to arrest this desperate murderer with the same absolutely quiet and businesslike bearing with which he would have ascended the official staircase of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>. </span>
<span sid='37433' title='37433'>The Pinkerton man had tried to push past him, but Gregson had firmly elbowed him back. </span>
<span sid='37434' title='37434'><a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> dangers were the privilege of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> force.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37435' title='37435'>The door of the left-hand flat upon the third landing was standing ajar. </span>
<span sid='37436' title='37436'>Gregson pushed it open. </span>
<span sid='37437' title='37437'>Within, all was absolute silence and darkness. </span>
<span sid='37438' title='37438'>I struck a match, and lit the detective's lantern. </span>
<span sid='37439' title='37439'>As I did so, and as the flicker steadied into a flame, we all gave a gasp of surprise. </span>
<span sid='37440' title='37440'>On the deal boards of the carpet-less floor there was outlined a fresh track of blood. </span>
<span sid='37441' title='37441'>The red steps pointed towards us, and led away from an inner room, the door of which was closed. </span>
<span sid='37442' title='37442'>Gregson flung it open and held his light full blaze in front of him, whilst we all peered eagerly over his shoulders.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37443' title='37443'>In the middle of the floor of the empty room was huddled the figure of an enormous man, his clean-shaven, swarthy face grotesquely horrible in its contortion, and his head encircled by a ghastly crimson halo of blood, lying in a broad wet circle upon the white woodwork. </span>
<span sid='37444' title='37444'>His knees were drawn up, his hands thrown out in agony, and from the centre of his broad, brown, upturned throat there projected the white haft of a knife driven blade-deep into his body. </span>
<span sid='37445' title='37445'>Giant as he was, the man must have gone down like a pole-axed ox before that terrific blow. </span>
<span sid='37446' title='37446'>Beside his right hand a most formidable horn-handled, two-edged dagger lay upon the floor, and near it a black kid glove.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37447' title='37447'>'By George! it's Black Gorgiano himself!' cried the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n detective. </span>
<span sid='37448' title='37448'>'Someone has got ahead of us this time.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37449' title='37449'>'Here is the candle in the window, Mr Holmes,' said Gregson. </span>
<span sid='37450' title='37450'>'Why, whatever are you doing?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37451' title='37451'>Holmes had stepped across, had lit the candle, and was passing it backwards and forwards across the window-panes. </span>
<span sid='37452' title='37452'>Then he peered into the darkness, blew the candle out, and threw it on the floor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37453' title='37453'>'I rather think that will be helpful,' said he. </span>
<span sid='37454' title='37454'>He came over and stood in deep thought while the two professionals were examining the body. </span>
<span sid='37455' title='37455'>'You say that three people came out from the flat while you were waiting downstairs,' said he, at last. </span>
<span sid='37456' title='37456'>'Did you observe them closely?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37457' title='37457'>'Yes, I did.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37458' title='37458'>'Was there a fellow about thirty, black-bearded, dark, of middle size?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37459' title='37459'>'Yes, he was the last to pass me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37460' title='37460'>'That is your man, I fancy. </span>
<span sid='37461' title='37461'>I can give you his description, and we have a very excellent outline of his footmark. </span>
<span sid='37462' title='37462'>That should be enough for you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37463' title='37463'>'Not much, Mr Holmes, among the millions of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37464' title='37464'>'Perhaps not. </span>
<span sid='37465' title='37465'>That is why I thought it best to summon this lady to your aid.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37466' title='37466'>We all turned round at the words. </span>
<span sid='37467' title='37467'>There, framed in the doorway, was a tall and beautiful woman - the mysterious lodger of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bloomsbury&t=h'>Bloomsbury</a>. </span>
<span sid='37468' title='37468'>Slowly she advanced, her face pale and drawn with a frightful apprehension, her eyes fixed and staring, her terrified gaze riveted upon the dark figure on the floor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37469' title='37469'>'You have killed him!' she muttered. </span>
<span sid='37470' title='37470'>'Oh, Dio mio, you have killed him!' </span>
<span sid='37471' title='37471'>Then I heard a sudden sharp intake of her breath, and she sprang into the air with a cry of joy. </span>
<span sid='37472' title='37472'>Round and round the room she danced, her hands clapping, her dark eyes gleaming with delighted wonder, and a thousand pretty Italian exclamations pouring from her lips. </span>
<span sid='37473' title='37473'>It was terrible and amazing to see such a woman so convulsed with joy at such a sight. </span>
<span sid='37474' title='37474'>Suddenly she stopped and gazed at us all with a questioning stare.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37475' title='37475'>'But you! </span>
<span sid='37476' title='37476'>You are police, are you not? </span>
<span sid='37477' title='37477'>You have killed Giuseppe Gorgiano. </span>
<span sid='37478' title='37478'>Is it not so?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37479' title='37479'>'We are police, madam.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37480' title='37480'>She looked round into the shadows of the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37481' title='37481'>'But where, then, is Gennaro?' she asked. </span>
<span sid='37482' title='37482'>'He is my husband, Gennaro Lucca. </span>
<span sid='37483' title='37483'>I am Emilia Lucca, and we are both from New <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=York&t=h'>York</a>. </span>
<span sid='37484' title='37484'>Where is Gennaro? </span>
<span sid='37485' title='37485'>He called me this moment from this window, and I ran with all my speed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37486' title='37486'>'It was I who called,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37487' title='37487'>'You! </span>
<span sid='37488' title='37488'>How could you call?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37489' title='37489'>'Your cipher was not difficult, madam. </span>
<span sid='37490' title='37490'>Your presence here was desirable. </span>
<span sid='37491' title='37491'>I knew that I had only to flash "Vieni" and you would surely come.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37492' title='37492'>The beautiful Italian looked with awe at my companion. </span>
<span sid='37493' title='37493'>'I do not understand how you know these things,' she said. </span>
<span sid='37494' title='37494'>'Giuseppe Gorgiano - how did he -' </span>
<span sid='37495' title='37495'>She paused, and then suddenly her face lit up with pride and delight. </span>
<span sid='37496' title='37496'>'Now I see it! </span>
<span sid='37497' title='37497'>My Gennaro! </span>
<span sid='37498' title='37498'>My splendid, beautiful Gennaro, who has guarded me safe from all harm, he did it, with his own strong hand he killed the monster! </span>
<span sid='37499' title='37499'>Oh, Gennaro, how wonderful you are! </span>
<span sid='37500' title='37500'>What woman could ever be worthy of such a man?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37501' title='37501'>'Well, Mrs Lucca,' said the prosaic Gregson, laying his hand upon the lady's sleeve with as little sentiment as if she were a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Notting Hill&t=h'>Notting Hill</a> hooligan,'I am not very clear yet who you are or what you are, but you've said enough to make it very clear that we shall want you at the Yard.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37502' title='37502'>'One moment, Gregson,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='37503' title='37503'>'I rather fancy that this lady may be as anxious to give us information as we can be to get it. </span>
<span sid='37504' title='37504'>You understand, madam, that your husband will be arrested and tried for the death of the man who lies before us? </span>
<span sid='37505' title='37505'>What you say may be used in evidence. </span>
<span sid='37506' title='37506'>But if you think that he has acted from motives which are not criminal, and which he would wish to have known, then you cannot serve him better than by telling us the whole story.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37507' title='37507'>'Now that Gorgiano is dead we fear nothing,' said the lady. </span>
<span sid='37508' title='37508'>'He was a devil and a monster, and there can be no judge in the world who would punish my husband for having killed him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37509' title='37509'>'In that case,' said Holmes, 'my suggestion is that we lock this door, leave things as we found them, go with this lady to her room, and form our opinion after we have heard what it is that she has to say to us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37510' title='37510'>Half an hour later we were seated, all four, in the small sitting-room of Signora Lucca, listening to her remarkable narrative of those sinister events, the ending of which we had chanced to witness. </span>
<span sid='37511' title='37511'>She spoke in rapid and fluent but very unconventional English, which, for the sake of clearness, I will make grammatical.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37512' title='37512'>'I was born in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Posilippo&t=h'>Posilippo</a>, near <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Naples&t=h'>Naples</a>,' said she, 'and was the daughter of Augusto Barelli, who was the chief lawyer and once the deputy of that port. </span>
<span sid='37513' title='37513'>Gennaro was in my father's employment, and I came to love him, as any woman must. </span>
<span sid='37514' title='37514'>He had neither money nor position - nothing but his beauty and strength and energy - so my father forbade the match. </span>
<span sid='37515' title='37515'>We fled together, were married at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bari&t=h'>Bari</a>, and sold my jewels to gain the money which would take us to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>. </span>
<span sid='37516' title='37516'>This was four years ago, and we have been in New <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=York&t=h'>York</a> ever since.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37517' title='37517'>'Fortune was very good to us at first. </span>
<span sid='37518' title='37518'>Gennaro was able to do a service to an Italian gentleman - he saved him from some ruffians in the place called <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Bowery&t=h'>the Bowery</a>, and so made a powerful friend. </span>
<span sid='37519' title='37519'>His name was Tito Castalotte, and he was the senior partner of the great firm of Castalotte and Zamba, who are the chief fruit importers of New <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=York&t=h'>York</a>. </span>
<span sid='37520' title='37520'>Signor Zamba is an invalid, and our new friend Castalotte has all power within the firm, which employs more than three hundred men. </span>
<span sid='37521' title='37521'>He took my husband into his employment, made him head of a department, and showed his goodwill towards him in every way. </span>
<span sid='37522' title='37522'>Signor Castalotte was a bachelor, and I believe that he felt as if Gennaro was his son, and both my husband and I loved him as if he were our father. </span>
<span sid='37523' title='37523'>We had taken and furnished a little house in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brooklyn&t=h'>Brooklyn</a>, and our whole future seemed assured, when that black cloud appeared which was soon to overspread our sky.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37524' title='37524'>'One night, when Gennaro returned from his work, he brought a fellow-countryman back with him. </span>
<span sid='37525' title='37525'>His name was Gorgiano, and he had come also from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Posilippo&t=h'>Posilippo</a>. </span>
<span sid='37526' title='37526'>He was a huge man, as you can testify, for you have looked upon his corpse. </span>
<span sid='37527' title='37527'>Not only was his body that of a giant, but everything about him was grotesque, gigantic, and terrifying. </span>
<span sid='37528' title='37528'>His voice was like thunder in our little house. </span>
<span sid='37529' title='37529'>There was scarce room for the whirl of his great arms as he talked. </span>
<span sid='37530' title='37530'>His thoughts, his emotions, his passions, all were exaggerated and monstrous. </span>
<span sid='37531' title='37531'>He talked, or rather roared, with such energy that others could but sit and listen, cowed with the mighty stream of words. </span>
<span sid='37532' title='37532'>His eyes blazed at you and held you at his mercy. </span>
<span sid='37533' title='37533'>He was a terrible and wonderful man. </span>
<span sid='37534' title='37534'>I thank God that he is dead!</span>
<p>
<span sid='37535' title='37535'>'He came again and again. </span>
<span sid='37536' title='37536'>Yet I was aware that Gennaro was no more happy than I was in his presence. </span>
<span sid='37537' title='37537'>My poor husband would sit pale and listless, listening to the endless raving upon politics and upon social questions which made up our visitor's conversation. </span>
<span sid='37538' title='37538'>Gennaro said nothing, but I who knew him so well could read in his face some emotion which I had never seen there before. </span>
<span sid='37539' title='37539'>At first I thought that it was dislike. </span>
<span sid='37540' title='37540'>And then, gradually, I understood that it was more than dislike. </span>
<span sid='37541' title='37541'>It was fear - a deep, secret, shrinking fear. </span>
<span sid='37542' title='37542'>That night - the night that I read his terror - I put my arms round him and I implored him by his love for me and by all that he held dear to hold nothing from me, and to tell me why this huge man overshadowed him so.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37543' title='37543'>'He told me, and my own heart grew cold as ice as I listened. </span>
<span sid='37544' title='37544'>My poor Gennaro, in his wild and fiery days, when all the world seemed against him and his mind was driven half mad by the injustices of life, had joined a Neapolitan society, the Red Circle, which was allied to the old Carbonari. </span>
<span sid='37545' title='37545'>The oaths and secrets of this brotherhood were frightful, but once within its rule no escape was possible. </span>
<span sid='37546' title='37546'>When we had fled to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a> Gennaro thought that he had cast it all off for ever. </span>
<span sid='37547' title='37547'>What was his horror one evening to meet in the streets the very man who had initiated him in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Naples&t=h'>Naples</a>, the giant Gorgiano, a man who had earned the name of "Death" in the South of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Italy&t=h'>Italy</a>, for he was red to the elbow in murder! </span>
<span sid='37548' title='37548'>He had come to New <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=York&t=h'>York</a> to avoid the Italian police, and he had already planted a branch of this dreadful society in his new home. </span>
<span sid='37549' title='37549'>All this Gennaro told me, and showed me a summons which he had received that very day, a Red Circle drawn upon the head of it, telling him that a lodge would be held upon a certain date, and that his presence at it was required and ordered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37550' title='37550'>'That was bad enough, but worse was to come. </span>
<span sid='37551' title='37551'>I had noticed for some time that when Gorgiano came to us, as he constantly did, in the evening, he spoke much to me, and even when his words were to my husband, those terrible, glaring, wild-beast eyes of his were always turned upon me. </span>
<span sid='37552' title='37552'>One night his secret came out. </span>
<span sid='37553' title='37553'>I had awakened what he called "love" within him - the love of a brute - a savage. </span>
<span sid='37554' title='37554'>Gennaro had not yet returned when he came. </span>
<span sid='37555' title='37555'>He pushed his way in, seized me in his mighty arms, hugged me in his bear's embrace, covered me with kisses, and implored me to come away with him. </span>
<span sid='37556' title='37556'>I was struggling and screaming when Gennaro entered and attacked him. </span>
<span sid='37557' title='37557'>He struck Gennaro senseless and fled from the house which he was never more to enter. </span>
<span sid='37558' title='37558'>It was a deadly enemy that we made that night.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37559' title='37559'>'A few days later came the meeting. </span>
<span sid='37560' title='37560'>Gennaro returned from it with a face which told me that something dreadful had occured. </span>
<span sid='37561' title='37561'>It was worse than we could have imagined possible. </span>
<span sid='37562' title='37562'>The funds of the society were raised by blackmailing rich Italians and threatening them with violence should they refuse the money. </span>
<span sid='37563' title='37563'>It seems that Castalotte, our dear friend and benefactor, had been approached. </span>
<span sid='37564' title='37564'>He had refused to yield to threats, and he had handed the notices to the police. </span>
<span sid='37565' title='37565'>It was resolved now that such an example should be made of him as would prevent any other victim from rebelling. </span>
<span sid='37566' title='37566'>At the meeting it was arranged that he and his house should be blown up with dynamite. </span>
<span sid='37567' title='37567'>There was a drawing of lots as to who should carry out the deed. </span>
<span sid='37568' title='37568'>Gennaro saw our enemy's cruel face smiling at him as he dipped his hand in the bag. </span>
<span sid='37569' title='37569'>No doubt it had been prearranged in some fashion, for it was the fatal disc with the Red Circle upon it, the mandate for murder, which lay upon his palm. </span>
<span sid='37570' title='37570'>He was to kill his best friend, or he was to expose himself and me to the vengeance of his comrades. </span>
<span sid='37571' title='37571'>It was part of their fiendish system to punish those whom they feared or hated by injuring not only their own persons, but those whom they loved, and it was the knowledge of this which hung as a terror over my poor Gennaro's head and drove him nearly crazy with apprehension.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37572' title='37572'>'All that night we sat together, our arms round each other, each strengthening each for the troubles that lay before us. </span>
<span sid='37573' title='37573'>The very next evening had been fixed for the attempt. </span>
<span sid='37574' title='37574'>By midday my husband and I were on our way to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, but not before he had given our benefactor full warning of his danger, and had also left such information for the police as would safeguard his life for the future.</span>
<p>
<span sid='37575' title='37575'>'The rest, gentlemen, you know for yourselves. </span>
<span sid='37576' title='37576'>We were sure that our enemies would be behind us like our own shadows. </span>
<span sid='37577' title='37577'>Gorgiano had his private reasons for vengeance, but in any case we knew how ruthless, cunning, and untiring he could be. </span>
<span sid='37578' title='37578'>Both <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Italy&t=h'>Italy</a> and <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a> are full of stories of his dreadful powers. </span>
<span sid='37579' title='37579'>If ever they were exerted it would be now. </span>
<span sid='37580' title='37580'>My darling made use of the few clear days which our start had given us in arranging for a refuge for me in such a fashion that no possible danger could reach me. </span>
<span sid='37581' title='37581'>For his own part, he wished to be free that he might communicate both with the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n and with the Italian police. </span>
<span sid='37582' title='37582'>I do not myself know where he lived, or how. </span>
<span sid='37583' title='37583'>All that I learned was through the columns of a newspaper. </span>
<span sid='37584' title='37584'>But once, as I looked through my window, I saw two Italians watching the house, and I understood that in some way Gorgiano had found out our retreat. </span>
<span sid='37585' title='37585'>Finally Gennaro told me, through the paper, that he would signal to me from a certain window, but when the signals came they were nothing but warnings, which were suddenly interrupted. </span>
<span sid='37586' title='37586'>It is very clear to me now that he knew Gorgiano to be close upon him, and that, thank God! he was ready for him when he came. </span>
<span sid='37587' title='37587'>And now, gentlemen, I would ask you whether we have anything to fear from the law, or whether any judge upon earth would condemn my Gennaro for what he has done?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37588' title='37588'>'Well, Mr Gregson,' said the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n, looking across at the official, 'I don't know what your British point of view may be, but I guess that in New <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=York&t=h'>York</a> this lady's husband will receive a pretty general vote of thanks.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37589' title='37589'>'She will have to come with me and see the Chief,' Gregson answered. </span>
<span sid='37590' title='37590'>'If what she says is corroborated, I do not think she or her husband has much to fear. </span>
<span sid='37591' title='37591'>But what I can't make head or tail of, Mr Holmes, is how on earth you got yourself mixed up in the matter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='37592' title='37592'>'Education, Gregson, education. </span>
<span sid='37593' title='37593'>Still seeking knowledge at the old university. </span>
<span sid='37594' title='37594'>Well, Watson, you have one more specimen of the tragic and grotesque to add to your collection. </span>
<span sid='37595' title='37595'>By the way, it is not eight o'clock, and a Wagner night at Covent Garden! </span>
<span sid='37596' title='37596'>If we hurry, we might be in time for the second act.'</span>
