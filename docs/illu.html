<p>
<span sid='49555' title='49555'>'It can't hurt now,' was Mr Sherlock Holmes's comment when, for the tenth time in as many years, I asked his leave to reveal the following narrative. </span>
<span sid='49556' title='49556'>So it was that at last I obtained permission to put on record what was, in some ways, the supreme moment of my friend's career.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49557' title='49557'>Both Holmes and I had a weakness for the Turkish Bath. </span>
<span sid='49558' title='49558'>It was over a smoke in the pleasant lassitude of the dryingroom that I found him less reticent and more human than anywhere else. </span>
<span sid='49559' title='49559'>On the upper floor of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Northumberland Avenue&t=h'>Northumberland Avenue</a> establishment there is an isolated corner where two couches lie side by side, and it was on these that we lay upon September 3, 1902, the day when my narrative begins. </span>
<span sid='49560' title='49560'>I had asked him whether anything was stirring, and for answer he had shot his long, thin, nervous arm out of the sheets which enveloped him and had drawn an envelope from the inside pocket of the coat which hung beside him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49561' title='49561'>'It may be some fussy, self-important fool, it may be a matter of life or death,' said he, as he handed me the note. </span>
<span sid='49562' title='49562'>'I know no more than this message tells me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49563' title='49563'>It was from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Carlton Club&t=h'>the Carlton Club</a>, and dated the evening before. </span>
<span sid='49564' title='49564'>This is what I read:</span>
<p>
<span sid='49565' title='49565'>Sir James Damery presents his compliments to Mr Sherlock Holmes, and will call upon him at 4.30 to-morrow. </span>
<span sid='49566' title='49566'>Sir James begs to say that the matter upon which he desires to consult Mr Holmes is very delicate, and also very important. </span>
<span sid='49567' title='49567'>He trusts, therefore, that Mr Holmes will make every effort to grant this interview, and that he will confirm it over the telephone to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Carlton Club&t=h'>the Carlton Club</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49568' title='49568'>'I need not say that I have confirmed it, Watson,' said Holmes, as I returned the paper. </span>
<span sid='49569' title='49569'>'Do you know anything of this man Damery?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49570' title='49570'>'Only that his name is a household word in Society.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49571' title='49571'>'Well, I can tell you a little more than that. </span>
<span sid='49572' title='49572'>He has rather a reputation for arranging delicate matters which are to be kept out of the papers. </span>
<span sid='49573' title='49573'>You may remember his negotiations with Sir George Lewis over the Hammerford Will case. </span>
<span sid='49574' title='49574'>He is a man of the world with a natural turn for diplomacy. </span>
<span sid='49575' title='49575'>I am bound, therefore, to hope that it is not a false scent and that he has some real need for our assistance.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49576' title='49576'>'Our?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49577' title='49577'>'Well, if you will be so good, Watson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49578' title='49578'>'I shall be honoured.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49579' title='49579'>'Then you have the hour - four-thirty. </span>
<span sid='49580' title='49580'>Until then we can put the matter out of our heads.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49581' title='49581'>I was living in my own rooms in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Queen Anne Street&t=h'>Queen Anne Street</a> at the time, but I was round at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> before the time named. </span>
<span sid='49582' title='49582'>Sharp to the half-hour, Colonel Sir James Damery was announced. </span>
<span sid='49583' title='49583'>It is hardly necessary to describe him, for many will remember that large, bluff, honest personality, that broad, clean-shaven face, above all, that pleasant, mellow voice. </span>
<span sid='49584' title='49584'>Frankness shone from his grey Irish eyes, and good humour played round his mobile, smiling lips. </span>
<span sid='49585' title='49585'>His lucent top-hat, his dark frock-coat, indeed, every detail, from the pearl pin in the black satin cravat to the lavender spats over the varnished shoes, spoke of the meticulous care in dress for which he was famous. </span>
<span sid='49586' title='49586'>The big, masterful aristocrat dominated the little room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49587' title='49587'>'Of course, I was prepared to find Dr Watson,' he remarked, with a courteous bow. </span>
<span sid='49588' title='49588'>'His collaboration may be very necessary, for we are dealing on this occasion, Mr Holmes, with a man to whom violence is familiar and who will, literally, stick at nothing. </span>
<span sid='49589' title='49589'>I should say that there is no more dangerous man in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49590' title='49590'>'I have had several opponents to whom that flattering term has been applied,' said Holmes, with a smile. </span>
<span sid='49591' title='49591'>'Don't you smoke? </span>
<span sid='49592' title='49592'>Then you will excuse me if I light my pipe. </span>
<span sid='49593' title='49593'>If your man is more dangerous than the late Professor Moriarty, or than the living Colonel Sebastian Moran, then he is indeed worth meeting. </span>
<span sid='49594' title='49594'>May I ask his name?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49595' title='49595'>'Have you ever heard of Baron Gruner?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49596' title='49596'>'You mean the Austrian murderer?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49597' title='49597'>Colonel Damery threw up his kid-gloved hands with a laugh. </span>
<span sid='49598' title='49598'>'There is no getting past you, Mr Holmes! </span>
<span sid='49599' title='49599'>Wonderful! </span>
<span sid='49600' title='49600'>So you have already sized him up as a murderer?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49601' title='49601'>'It is my business to follow the details of Continental crime. </span>
<span sid='49602' title='49602'>Who could possibly have read what happened at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Prague&t=h'>Prague</a> and have any doubts as to the man's guilt! </span>
<span sid='49603' title='49603'>It was a purely technical legal point and the suspicious death of a witness that saved him! </span>
<span sid='49604' title='49604'>I am as sure that he killed his wife when the so-called "accident" happened in the Splügen Pass as if I had seen him do it. </span>
<span sid='49605' title='49605'>I knew, also, that he had come to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, and had a presentiment that sooner or later he would find me some work to do. </span>
<span sid='49606' title='49606'>Well, what has Baron Gruner been up to? </span>
<span sid='49607' title='49607'>I presume it is not this old tragedy which has come up again?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49608' title='49608'>'No, it is more serious than that. </span>
<span sid='49609' title='49609'>To revenge crime is important, but to prevent it is more so. </span>
<span sid='49610' title='49610'>It is a terrible thing, Mr Holmes, to see a dreadful event, an atrocious situation, preparing itself before your eyes, to clearly understand whither it will lead, and yet to be utterly unable to avert it. </span>
<span sid='49611' title='49611'>Can a human being be placed in a more trying position?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49612' title='49612'>'Perhaps not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49613' title='49613'>'Then you will sympathize with the client in whose interests I am acting.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49614' title='49614'>'I did not understand that you were merely an intermediary. </span>
<span sid='49615' title='49615'>Who is the principal?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49616' title='49616'>'Mr Holmes, I must beg you not to press that question. </span>
<span sid='49617' title='49617'>It is important that I should be able to assure him that his honoured name has been in no way dragged into the matter. </span>
<span sid='49618' title='49618'>His motives are, to the last degree, honourable and chivalrous, but he prefers to remain unknown. </span>
<span sid='49619' title='49619'>I need not say that your fees will be assured and that you will be given a perfectly free hand. </span>
<span sid='49620' title='49620'>Surely the actual name of your client is immaterial?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49621' title='49621'>'I am sorry,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='49622' title='49622'>'I am accustomed to have mystery at one end of my cases, but to have it at both ends is too confusing. </span>
<span sid='49623' title='49623'>I fear, Sir James, that I must decline to act.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49624' title='49624'>Our visitor was greatly disturbed. </span>
<span sid='49625' title='49625'>His large, sensitive face was darkened with emotion and disappointment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49626' title='49626'>'You hardly realize the effect of your own action, Mr Holmes,' said he. </span>
<span sid='49627' title='49627'>'You place me in a most serious dilemma, for I am perfectly certain that you would be proud to take over the case if I could give you the facts, and yet a promise forbids me from revealing them all. </span>
<span sid='49628' title='49628'>May I, at least, lay all that I can before you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49629' title='49629'>'By all means, so long as it is understood that I commit myself to nothing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49630' title='49630'>'That is understood. </span>
<span sid='49631' title='49631'>In the first place, you have no doubt heard of General de Merville?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49632' title='49632'>'De Merville of Khyber fame? </span>
<span sid='49633' title='49633'>Yes, I have heard of him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49634' title='49634'>'He has a daughter, Violet de Merville, young, rich, beautiful, accomplished, a wonder-woman in every way. </span>
<span sid='49635' title='49635'>It is this daughter, this lovely, innocent girl, whom we are endeavouring to save from the clutches of a fiend.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49636' title='49636'>'Baron Gruner has some hold over her, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49637' title='49637'>'The strongest of all holds where a woman is concerned-the hold of love. </span>
<span sid='49638' title='49638'>The fellow is, as you may have heard, extraordinarily handsome, with a most fascinating manner, a gentle voice, and that air of romance and mystery which means so much to a woman. </span>
<span sid='49639' title='49639'>He is said to have the whole sex at his mercy and to have made ample use of the fact.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49640' title='49640'>'But how came such a man to meet a lady of the standing of Miss Violet de Merville?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49641' title='49641'>'It was on a Mediterranean yachting voyage. </span>
<span sid='49642' title='49642'>The company, though select, paid their own passages. </span>
<span sid='49643' title='49643'>No doubt the promoters hardly realized the Baron's true character until it was too late. </span>
<span sid='49644' title='49644'>The villain attached himself to the lady, and with such effect that he has completely and absolutely won her heart. </span>
<span sid='49645' title='49645'>To say that she loves him hardly expresses it. </span>
<span sid='49646' title='49646'>She dotes upon him, she is obsessed by him. </span>
<span sid='49647' title='49647'>Outside of him there is nothing on earth. </span>
<span sid='49648' title='49648'>She will not hear one word against him. </span>
<span sid='49649' title='49649'>Everything has been done to cure her of her madness, but in vain. </span>
<span sid='49650' title='49650'>To sum up, she proposes to marry him next month. </span>
<span sid='49651' title='49651'>As she is of age and has a will of iron, it is hard to know how to prevent her.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49652' title='49652'>'Does she know about the Austrian episode?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49653' title='49653'>'The cunning devil has told her every unsavoury public scandal of his past life, but always in such a way as to make himself out to be an innocent martyr. </span>
<span sid='49654' title='49654'>She absolutely accepts his version and will listen to no other.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49655' title='49655'>'Dear me! </span>
<span sid='49656' title='49656'>But surely you have inadvertently let out the name of your client? </span>
<span sid='49657' title='49657'>It is no doubt General de Merville.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49658' title='49658'>Our visitor fidgeted in his chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49659' title='49659'>'I could deceive you by saying so, Mr Holmes, but it would not be true. </span>
<span sid='49660' title='49660'>De Merville is a broken man. </span>
<span sid='49661' title='49661'>The strong soldier has been utterly demoralized by this incident. </span>
<span sid='49662' title='49662'>He has lost the nerve which never failed him on the battlefield and has become a weak, doddering old man, utterly incapable of contending with a brilliant, forceful rascal like this Austrian. </span>
<span sid='49663' title='49663'>My client, however, is an old friend, one who has known the General intimately for many years and taken a paternal interest in this young girl since she wore short frocks. </span>
<span sid='49664' title='49664'>He cannot see this tragedy consummated without some attempt to stop it. </span>
<span sid='49665' title='49665'>There is nothing in which <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a> can act. </span>
<span sid='49666' title='49666'>It was his own suggestion that you should be called in, but it was, as I have said, on the express stipulation that he should not be personally involved in the matter. </span>
<span sid='49667' title='49667'>I have no doubt, Mr Holmes, with your great powers you could easily trace my client back through me, but I must ask you, as a point of honour, to refrain from doing so, and not to break in upon his incognito.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49668' title='49668'>Holmes gave a whimsical smile.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49669' title='49669'>'I think I may safely promise that,' said he. </span>
<span sid='49670' title='49670'>'I may add that your problem interests me, and that I shall be prepared to look into it. </span>
<span sid='49671' title='49671'>How shall I keep in touch with you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49672' title='49672'>'<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=The Carlton Club&t=h'>The Carlton Club</a> will find me. </span>
<span sid='49673' title='49673'>But, in case of emergency, there is a private telephone call, "XX.31."'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49674' title='49674'>Holmes noted it down and sat, still smiling, with the open memorandum-book upon his knee.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49675' title='49675'>'The Baron's present address, please?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49676' title='49676'>'Vernon Lodge, near <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kingston&t=h'>Kingston</a>. </span>
<span sid='49677' title='49677'>It is a large house. </span>
<span sid='49678' title='49678'>He has been fortunate in some rather shady speculations and is a rich man, which, naturally, makes him a more dangerous antagonist.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49679' title='49679'>'Is he at home at present?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49680' title='49680'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49681' title='49681'>'Apart from what you have told me, can you give me any further information about the man?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49682' title='49682'>'He has expensive tastes. </span>
<span sid='49683' title='49683'>He is a horse fancier. </span>
<span sid='49684' title='49684'>For a short time he played polo at Hurlingham, but then this <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Prague&t=h'>Prague</a> affair got noised about and he had to leave. </span>
<span sid='49685' title='49685'>He collects books and pictures. </span>
<span sid='49686' title='49686'>He is a man with a considerable artistic side to his nature. </span>
<span sid='49687' title='49687'>He is, I believe, a recognized authority upon Chinese pottery, and has written a book upon the subject.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49688' title='49688'>'A complex mind,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='49689' title='49689'>'All great criminals have that. </span>
<span sid='49690' title='49690'>My old friend Charlie Peace was a violin virtuoso. </span>
<span sid='49691' title='49691'>Wainwright was no mean artist. </span>
<span sid='49692' title='49692'>I could quote many more. </span>
<span sid='49693' title='49693'>Well, Sir James, you will inform your client that I am turning my mind upon Baron Gruner. </span>
<span sid='49694' title='49694'>I can say no more. </span>
<span sid='49695' title='49695'>I have some sources of information of my own, and I dare say we may find some means of opening the matter up.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49696' title='49696'>When our visitor had left us, Holmes sat so long in deep thought that it seemed to me that he had forgotten my presence. </span>
<span sid='49697' title='49697'>At last, however, he came briskly back to earth.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49698' title='49698'>'Well, Watson, any views?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49699' title='49699'>'I should think you had better see the young lady herself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49700' title='49700'>'My dear Watson, if her poor old broken father cannot move her, how shall I, a stranger, prevail? </span>
<span sid='49701' title='49701'>And yet there is something in the suggestion if all else fails. </span>
<span sid='49702' title='49702'>But I think we must begin from a different angle. </span>
<span sid='49703' title='49703'>I rather fancy that Shinwell Johnson might be a help.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49704' title='49704'>I have not had occasion to mention Shinwell Johnson in these memoirs because I have seldom drawn my cases from the latter phases of my friend's career. </span>
<span sid='49705' title='49705'>During the first years of the century he became a valuable assistant. </span>
<span sid='49706' title='49706'>Johnson, I grieve to say, made his name first as a very dangerous villain and served two terms at Parkhurst. </span>
<span sid='49707' title='49707'>Finally, he repented and allied himself to Holmes, acting as his agent in the huge criminal underworld of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, and obtaining information which often proved to be of vital importance. </span>
<span sid='49708' title='49708'>Had Johnson been a 'nark' of the police he would soon have been exposed, but as he dealt with cases which never came directly into the courts, his activities were never realized by his companions. </span>
<span sid='49709' title='49709'>With the glamour of his two convictions upon him, he had the entrée of every night-club, doss-house, and gambling-den in the town, and his quick observation and active brain made him an ideal agent for gaining information. </span>
<span sid='49710' title='49710'>It was to him that Sherlock Holmes now proposed to turn.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49711' title='49711'>It was not possible for me to follow the immediate steps taken by my friend, for I had some pressing professional business of my own, but I met him by appointment that evening at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Simpson's&t=h'>Simpson's</a>, where, sitting at a small table in the front window, and looking down at the rushing stream of life in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Strand&t=h'>the Strand</a>, he told me something of what had passed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49712' title='49712'>'Johnson is on the prowl,' said he. </span>
<span sid='49713' title='49713'>'He may pick up some garbage in the darker recesses of the underworld, for it is down there, amid the black roots of crime, that we must hunt for this man's secrets.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49714' title='49714'>'But, if the lady will not accept what is already known, why should any fresh discovery of yours turn her from her purpose?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49715' title='49715'>'Who knows, Watson? </span>
<span sid='49716' title='49716'>Woman's heart and mind are insoluble puzzles to the male. </span>
<span sid='49717' title='49717'>Murder might be condoned or explained, and yet some smaller offence might rankle. </span>
<span sid='49718' title='49718'>Baron Gruner remarked to me-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49719' title='49719'>'He remarked to you!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49720' title='49720'>'Oh, to be sure, I had not told you of my plans! </span>
<span sid='49721' title='49721'>Well, Watson, I love to come to close grips with my man. </span>
<span sid='49722' title='49722'>I like to meet him eye to eye and read for myself the stuff that he is made of. </span>
<span sid='49723' title='49723'>When I had given Johnson his instructions, I took a cab out to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kingston&t=h'>Kingston</a> and found the Baron in a most affable mood.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49724' title='49724'>'Did he recognize you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49725' title='49725'>'There was no difficulty about that, for I simply sent in my card. </span>
<span sid='49726' title='49726'>He is an excellent antagonist, cool as ice, silky voiced and soothing as one of your fashionable consultants, and poisonous as a cobra. </span>
<span sid='49727' title='49727'>He has breed in him, a real aristocrat of crime, with a superficial suggestion of afternoontea and all the cruelty of the grave behind it. </span>
<span sid='49728' title='49728'>Yes, I am glad to have had my attention called to Baron Adelbert Gruner.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49729' title='49729'>'You say he was affable?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49730' title='49730'>'A purring cat who thinks he sees prospective mice. </span>
<span sid='49731' title='49731'>Some people's affability is more deadly than the violence of coarser souls. </span>
<span sid='49732' title='49732'>His greeting was characteristic. </span>
<span sid='49733' title='49733'>"I rather thought I should see you sooner or later, Mr Holmes," said he. </span>
<span sid='49734' title='49734'>"You have been engaged, no doubt, by General de Merville to endeavour to stop my marriage with his daughter, Violet. </span>
<span sid='49735' title='49735'>That is so, is it not?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='49736' title='49736'>'I acquiesced.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49737' title='49737'>'"My dear man," said he, "you will only ruin your own well-deserved reputation. </span>
<span sid='49738' title='49738'>It is not a case in which you can possibly succeed. </span>
<span sid='49739' title='49739'>You will have barren work, to say nothing of incurring some danger. </span>
<span sid='49740' title='49740'>Let me very strongly advise you to draw off at once."</span>
<p>
<span sid='49741' title='49741'>'"It is curious," I answered, "but that was the very advice which I had intended to give you. </span>
<span sid='49742' title='49742'>I have a respect for your brains, Baron, and the little which I have seen of your personality has not lessened it. </span>
<span sid='49743' title='49743'>Let me put it to you as man to man. </span>
<span sid='49744' title='49744'>No one wants to rake up your past and make you unduly uncomfortable. </span>
<span sid='49745' title='49745'>It is over, and you are now in smooth waters, but if you persist in this marriage you will raise up a swarm of powerful enemies who will never leave you alone until they have made <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> too hot to hold you. </span>
<span sid='49746' title='49746'>Is the game worth it? </span>
<span sid='49747' title='49747'>Surely you would be wiser if you left the lady alone. </span>
<span sid='49748' title='49748'>It would not be pleasant for you if these facts of your past were brought to her notice."</span>
<p>
<span sid='49749' title='49749'>'The Baron has little waxed tips of hair under his nose, like the short antennae of an insect. </span>
<span sid='49750' title='49750'>These quivered with amusement as he listened, and he finally broke into a gentle chuckle.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49751' title='49751'>'"Excuse my amusement, Mr Holmes," said he, "but it is really funny to see you trying to play a hand with no cards in it. </span>
<span sid='49752' title='49752'>I don't think anyone could do it better, but it is rather pathetic, all the same. </span>
<span sid='49753' title='49753'>Not a colour card there, Mr Holmes, nothing but the smallest of the small."</span>
<p>
<span sid='49754' title='49754'>'"So you think."</span>
<p>
<span sid='49755' title='49755'>'"So I know. </span>
<span sid='49756' title='49756'>Let me make the thing clear to you, for my own hand is so strong that I can afford to show it. </span>
<span sid='49757' title='49757'>I have been fortunate enough to win the entire affection of this lady. </span>
<span sid='49758' title='49758'>This was given to me in spite of the fact that I told her very clearly of all the unhappy incidents in my past life. </span>
<span sid='49759' title='49759'>I also told her that certain wicked and designing persons - I hope you recognize yourself - would come to her and tell her these things, and I warned her how to treat them. </span>
<span sid='49760' title='49760'>You have heard of post-hypnotic suggestion, Mr Holmes? </span>
<span sid='49761' title='49761'>Well, you will see how it works, for a man of personality can use hypnotism without any vulgar passes or tomfoolery. </span>
<span sid='49762' title='49762'>So she is ready for you and, I have no doubt, would give you an appointment, for she is quite amenable to her father's will - save only in the one little matter."</span>
<p>
<span sid='49763' title='49763'>'Well, Watson, there seemed to be no more to say, so I took my leave with as much cold dignity as I could summon, but, as I had my hand on the door-handle, he stopped me. </span>
<span sid='49764' title='49764'>"By the way, Mr Holmes," said he, "did you know Le Brun, the French agent?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='49765' title='49765'>'"Yes," said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49766' title='49766'>'"Do you know what befell him?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='49767' title='49767'>'"I heard that he was beaten by some Apaches in the Montmartre district and crippled for life."</span>
<p>
<span sid='49768' title='49768'>'"Quite true, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='49769' title='49769'>By a curious coincidence he had been inquiring into my affairs only a week before. </span>
<span sid='49770' title='49770'>Don't do it, Mr Holmes, it's not a lucky thing to do. </span>
<span sid='49771' title='49771'>Several have found that out. </span>
<span sid='49772' title='49772'>My last word to you is, go your own way and let me go mine. </span>
<span sid='49773' title='49773'>Good-bye!"</span>
<p>
<span sid='49774' title='49774'>'So there you are, Watson. </span>
<span sid='49775' title='49775'>You are up to date now.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49776' title='49776'>'The fellow seems dangerous.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49777' title='49777'>'Mighty dangerous. </span>
<span sid='49778' title='49778'>I disregard the blusterer, but this is the sort of man who says rather less than he means.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49779' title='49779'>'Must you interfere? </span>
<span sid='49780' title='49780'>Does it really matter if he marries the girl?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49781' title='49781'>'Considering that he undoubtedly murdered his last wife, I should say it mattered very much. </span>
<span sid='49782' title='49782'>Besides, the client! </span>
<span sid='49783' title='49783'>Well, well, we need not discuss that. </span>
<span sid='49784' title='49784'>When you have finished your coffee you had best come home with me, for the blithe Shinwell will be there with his report.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49785' title='49785'>We found him sure enough, a huge, coarse, red-faced, scorbutic man, with a pair of vivid black eyes which were the only external sign of the very cunning mind within. </span>
<span sid='49786' title='49786'>It seems that he had dived down into what was peculiarly his kingdom, and beside him on the settee was a brand which he had brought up in the shape of a slim, flame-like young woman with a pale, intense face, youthful, and yet so worn with sin and sorrow that one read the terrible years which had left their leprous mark upon her.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49787' title='49787'>'This is Miss Kitty Winter,' said Shinwell Johnson, waving his fat hand as an introduction. </span>
<span sid='49788' title='49788'>'What she don't know-well, there, she'll speak for herself. </span>
<span sid='49789' title='49789'>Put my hand right on her, Mr Holmes, within an hour of your message.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49790' title='49790'>'I'm easy to find,' said the young woman. </span>
<span sid='49791' title='49791'>'Hell, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, gets me every time. </span>
<span sid='49792' title='49792'>Same address for Porky Shinwell. </span>
<span sid='49793' title='49793'>We're old mates, Porky, you' and I. </span>
<span sid='49794' title='49794'>But, by Cripes! </span>
<span sid='49795' title='49795'>there is another who ought to be down in a lower hell than we if there was any justice in the world! </span>
<span sid='49796' title='49796'>That is the man you are after, Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49797' title='49797'>Holmes smiled. </span>
<span sid='49798' title='49798'>'I gather we have your good wishes, Miss Winter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49799' title='49799'>'If I can help to put him where he belongs, I'm yours to the rattle,' said our visitor, with fierce energy. </span>
<span sid='49800' title='49800'>There was an intensity of hatred in her white, set face and her blazing eyes such as woman seldom and man never can attain. </span>
<span sid='49801' title='49801'>'You needn't go into my past, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='49802' title='49802'>That's neither here nor there. </span>
<span sid='49803' title='49803'>But what I am Adelbert Gruner made me. </span>
<span sid='49804' title='49804'>If I could pull him down!' </span>
<span sid='49805' title='49805'>She clutched frantically with her hands into the air. </span>
<span sid='49806' title='49806'>'Oh, if I could pull him into the pit where he had pushed so many!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49807' title='49807'>'You know how the matter stands?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49808' title='49808'>'Porky Shinwell has been telling me. </span>
<span sid='49809' title='49809'>He's after some other poor fool and wants to marry her this time. </span>
<span sid='49810' title='49810'>You want to stop it. </span>
<span sid='49811' title='49811'>Well, you surely know enough about this devil to prevent any decent girt in her senses wanting to be in the same parish with him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49812' title='49812'>'She is not in her senses. </span>
<span sid='49813' title='49813'>She is madly in love. </span>
<span sid='49814' title='49814'>She has been told all about him. </span>
<span sid='49815' title='49815'>She cares nothing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49816' title='49816'>'Told about the murder?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49817' title='49817'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49818' title='49818'>'My Lord, she must have a nerve!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49819' title='49819'>'She puts them all down as slanders.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49820' title='49820'>'Couldn't you lay proofs before her silly eyes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49821' title='49821'>'Well, can you help us do so?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49822' title='49822'>'Ain't I a proof myself? </span>
<span sid='49823' title='49823'>If I stood before her and told her how he used me-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49824' title='49824'>'Would you do this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49825' title='49825'>'Would I? </span>
<span sid='49826' title='49826'>Would I nod?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49827' title='49827'>'Well, it might be worth trying. </span>
<span sid='49828' title='49828'>But he has told her most of his sins and had pardon from her, and I understand she will not reopen the question.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49829' title='49829'>'I'll lay he didn't tell her all,' said Miss Winter. </span>
<span sid='49830' title='49830'>'I caught a glimpse of one or two murders besides the one that made such a fuss. </span>
<span sid='49831' title='49831'>He would speak of someone in his velvet way and then look at me with a steady eye and say: </span>
<span sid='49832' title='49832'>"He died within a month." </span>
<span sid='49833' title='49833'>It wasn't hot air, either. </span>
<span sid='49834' title='49834'>But I took little notice - you see, I loved him myself at that time. </span>
<span sid='49835' title='49835'>Whatever he did went with me, same as with this poor fool! </span>
<span sid='49836' title='49836'>There was just one thing that shook me. </span>
<span sid='49837' title='49837'>Yes, by Cripes! </span>
<span sid='49838' title='49838'>if it had not been for his poisonous, lying tongue that explains and soothes, I'd have left him that very night. </span>
<span sid='49839' title='49839'>It's a book he has - a brown leather book with a lock, and his arms in gold on the outside. </span>
<span sid='49840' title='49840'>I think he was a bit drunk that night, or he would not have shown it to me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49841' title='49841'>'What was it, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49842' title='49842'>'I tell you, Mr Holmes, this man collects women, and takes a pride in his collection, as some men collect moths or butterflies. </span>
<span sid='49843' title='49843'>He had it all in that book. </span>
<span sid='49844' title='49844'>Snapshot photographs, names, details, everything about them. </span>
<span sid='49845' title='49845'>It was a beastly book - a book no man, even if he had come from the gutter, could have put together. </span>
<span sid='49846' title='49846'>But it was Adelbert Gruner's book all the same. </span>
<span sid='49847' title='49847'>"Souls I have ruined." </span>
<span sid='49848' title='49848'>He could have put that on the outside if he had been so minded. </span>
<span sid='49849' title='49849'>However, that's neither here nor there, for the book would not serve you, and, if it would, you can't get it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49850' title='49850'>'Where is it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49851' title='49851'>'How can I tell you where it is now? </span>
<span sid='49852' title='49852'>It's more than a year since I left him. </span>
<span sid='49853' title='49853'>I know where he kept it then. </span>
<span sid='49854' title='49854'>He's a precise, tidy cat of a man in many of his ways, so maybe it is still in the pigeon-hole of the old bureau in the inner study. </span>
<span sid='49855' title='49855'>Do you know his house?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49856' title='49856'>'I've been in the study,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49857' title='49857'>'Have you, though? </span>
<span sid='49858' title='49858'>You haven't been slow on the job if you only started this morning. </span>
<span sid='49859' title='49859'>Maybe dear Adelbert has met his match this time. </span>
<span sid='49860' title='49860'>The outer study is the one with the Chinese crockery in it - big glass cupboard between the windows. </span>
<span sid='49861' title='49861'>Then behind his desk is the door that leads to the inner study - a small room where he keeps papers and things.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49862' title='49862'>'Is he not afraid of burglars?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49863' title='49863'>'Adelbert is no coward. </span>
<span sid='49864' title='49864'>His worst enemy couldn't say that of him. </span>
<span sid='49865' title='49865'>He can look after himself. </span>
<span sid='49866' title='49866'>There's a burglar alarm at night. </span>
<span sid='49867' title='49867'>Besides, what is there for a burglar - unless they got away with all this fancy crockery?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49868' title='49868'>'No good,' said Shinwell Johnson, with the decided voice of the expert. </span>
<span sid='49869' title='49869'>'No fence wants stuff of that sort that you can neither melt nor sell.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49870' title='49870'>'Quite so,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='49871' title='49871'>'Well, now, Miss Winter, if you would call here to-morrow evening at five, I would consider in the meanwhile whether your suggestion of seeing this lady personally may not be arranged. </span>
<span sid='49872' title='49872'>I am exceedingly obliged to you for your co-operation. </span>
<span sid='49873' title='49873'>I need not say that my clients will consider liberally-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49874' title='49874'>'None of that, Mr Holmes,' cried the young woman. </span>
<span sid='49875' title='49875'>'I am not out for money. </span>
<span sid='49876' title='49876'>Let me see this man in the mud, and I've got all I worked for - in the mud with my foot on his cursed face. </span>
<span sid='49877' title='49877'>That's my price. </span>
<span sid='49878' title='49878'>I'm with you tomorrow or any other day so long as you are on his track. </span>
<span sid='49879' title='49879'>Porky here can tell you always where to find me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49880' title='49880'>I did not see Holmes again until the following evening, when we dined once more at our Strand restaurant. </span>
<span sid='49881' title='49881'>He shrugged his shoulders when I asked him what luck he had had in his interview. </span>
<span sid='49882' title='49882'>Then he told the story, which I would repeat in this way. </span>
<span sid='49883' title='49883'>His hard, dry statement needs some little editing to soften it into the terms of real life.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49884' title='49884'>'There was no difficulty at all about the appointment,' said Holmes, 'for the girl glories in showing abject filial obedience in all secondary things in an attempt to atone for her flagrant breach of it in her engagement. </span>
<span sid='49885' title='49885'>The General 'phoned that all was ready, and the fiery Miss W. turned up according to schedule, so that at half-past five a cab deposited us outside 104 Berkeley Square, where the old soldier resides - one of those awful grey <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> castles which would make a church seem frivolous. </span>
<span sid='49886' title='49886'>A footman showed us into a great yellow-curtained drawing-room, and there was the lady awaiting us, demure, pale, self-contained, as inflexible and remote as a snow image on a mountain.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49887' title='49887'>'I don't know quite how to make her clear to you, Watson. </span>
<span sid='49888' title='49888'>Perhaps you may meet her before we are through, and you can use your own gift of words. </span>
<span sid='49889' title='49889'>She is beautiful, but with the ethereal other-world beauty of some fanatic whose thoughts are set on high. </span>
<span sid='49890' title='49890'>I have seen such faces in the pictures of the old masters of the Middle Ages. </span>
<span sid='49891' title='49891'>How a beast-man could have laid his vile paws upon such a being of the beyond I cannot imagine. </span>
<span sid='49892' title='49892'>You may have noticed how extremes call to each other, the spiritual to the animal, the cave-man to the angel. </span>
<span sid='49893' title='49893'>You never saw a worse case than this.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49894' title='49894'>'She knew what we had come for, of course - that villain had lost no time in poisoning her mind against us. </span>
<span sid='49895' title='49895'>Miss Winter's advent rather amazed her, I think, but she waved us into our respective chairs like a Reverend Abbess receiving two rather leprous mendicants. </span>
<span sid='49896' title='49896'>If your head is inclined to swell, my dear Watson, take a course of Miss Violet de Merville.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49897' title='49897'>'"I Well, sir," said she, in a voice like the wind from an iceberg, "your name is familiar to me. </span>
<span sid='49898' title='49898'>You have called, as I understand, to malign my fiancé, Baron Gruner. </span>
<span sid='49899' title='49899'>It is only by my father's request that I see you at all, and I warn you in advance that anything you can say could not possibly have the slightest effect upon my mind."</span>
<p>
<span sid='49900' title='49900'>'I was sorry for her, Watson. </span>
<span sid='49901' title='49901'>I thought of her for the moment as I would have thought of a daughter of my own. </span>
<span sid='49902' title='49902'>I am not often eloquent. </span>
<span sid='49903' title='49903'>I use my head, not my heart. </span>
<span sid='49904' title='49904'>But I really did plead with her with all the warmth of words that I could find in my nature. </span>
<span sid='49905' title='49905'>I Pictured to her the awful position of the woman who only wakes to a man's character after she is his wife - a woman who has to submit to be caressed by bloody hands and lecherous lips. </span>
<span sid='49906' title='49906'>I spared her nothing - the shame, the fear, the agony, the hopelessness of it all. </span>
<span sid='49907' title='49907'>All my hot words could not bring one tinge of colour to those ivory cheeks or one gleam of emotion to those abstracted eyes. </span>
<span sid='49908' title='49908'>I thought of what the rascal had said about a post-hypnotic influence. </span>
<span sid='49909' title='49909'>One could really believe that she was living above the earth in some ecstatic dream. </span>
<span sid='49910' title='49910'>Yet there was nothing indefinite in her replies.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49911' title='49911'>'"I have listened to you with patience, Mr Holmes," said she. </span>
<span sid='49912' title='49912'>"The effect upon my mind is exactly as predicted. </span>
<span sid='49913' title='49913'>I am aware that Adelbert, that my fiancé, has had a stormy life in which he has incurred bitter hatreds and most unjust aspersions. </span>
<span sid='49914' title='49914'>You are only the last of a series who have brought their slanders before me. </span>
<span sid='49915' title='49915'>Possibly you mean well, though I learn that you are a paid agent who would have been equally willing to act for the Baron as against him. </span>
<span sid='49916' title='49916'>But in any case I wish you to understand once for all that I love him and that he loves me, and that the opinion of all the world is no more to me than the twitter of those birds outside the window. </span>
<span sid='49917' title='49917'>If his noble nature has ever for an instant fallen, it may be that I have been specially sent to raise it to its true and lofty level. </span>
<span sid='49918' title='49918'>I am not clear", here she turned her eyes upon my companion, "who this young lady may be."</span>
<p>
<span sid='49919' title='49919'>'I was about to answer when the girl broke in like a whirlwind. </span>
<span sid='49920' title='49920'>If ever you saw flame and ice face to face, it was those two women.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49921' title='49921'>'"I'll tell you who I am," she cried, springing out of her chair, her mouth all twisted with passion - "I am his last mistress. </span>
<span sid='49922' title='49922'>I am one of a hundred that he has tempted and used and ruined and thrown into the refuse heap, as he will you also. </span>
<span sid='49923' title='49923'>Your refuse heap is more likely to be a grave, and maybe that's the best. </span>
<span sid='49924' title='49924'>I tell you, you foolish woman, if you marry this man he'll be the death of you. </span>
<span sid='49925' title='49925'>It may be a broken heart or it may be a broken neck, but he'll have you one way or the other. </span>
<span sid='49926' title='49926'>It's not out of love for you I'm speaking. </span>
<span sid='49927' title='49927'>I don't care a tinker's curse whether you live or die. </span>
<span sid='49928' title='49928'>It's out of hate for him and to spite him and to get back on him for what he did to me. </span>
<span sid='49929' title='49929'>But it's all the same, and you needn't look at me like that, my fine lady, for you may be lower than I am before you are through with it."</span>
<p>
<span sid='49930' title='49930'>'I should prefer not to discuss such matters," said Miss de Merville, coldly. </span>
<span sid='49931' title='49931'>"Let me say once for all that I am aware of three passages in my fiancé's life in which he became entangled with designing women, and that I am assured of his hearty repentance for any evil that he may have done."</span>
<p>
<span sid='49932' title='49932'>'"Three passages!" screamed my companion. </span>
<span sid='49933' title='49933'>"You fool! </span>
<span sid='49934' title='49934'>You unutterable fool!"</span>
<p>
<span sid='49935' title='49935'>'"Mr Holmes, I beg that you will bring this interview to an end," said the icy voice. </span>
<span sid='49936' title='49936'>"I have obeyed my father's wish in seeing you, but I am not compelled to listen to the ravings of this person."</span>
<p>
<span sid='49937' title='49937'>'With an oath Miss Winter darted forward, and if I had not caught her wrist she would have clutched this maddening woman by the hair. </span>
<span sid='49938' title='49938'>I dragged her towards the door, and was lucky to get her back into the cab without a public scene, for she was beside herself with rage. </span>
<span sid='49939' title='49939'>In a cold way I felt pretty furious myself, Watson, for there was something indescribably annoying in the calm aloofness and supreme self-complaisance of the woman whom we were trying to save. </span>
<span sid='49940' title='49940'>So now once again you know exactly how we stand, and it is clear that I must plan some fresh opening move, for this gambit won't work. </span>
<span sid='49941' title='49941'>I'll keep in touch with you, Watson, for it is more than likely that you will have your part to play, though it is just possible that the next move may lie with them rather than with us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49942' title='49942'>And it did. </span>
<span sid='49943' title='49943'>Their blow fell - or his blow rather, for never could I believe that the lady was privy to it. </span>
<span sid='49944' title='49944'>I think I could show you the very paving-stone upon which I stood when my eyes fell upon the placard, and a pang of horror passed through my very soul. </span>
<span sid='49945' title='49945'>It was between the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Grand Hotel&t=h'>Grand Hotel</a> and <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Charing Cross&t=h'>Charing Cross</a> Station, where a one-legged news-vendor displayed his evening papers. </span>
<span sid='49946' title='49946'>The date was just two days after the last conversation. </span>
<span sid='49947' title='49947'>There, black upon yellow, was the terrible news-sheet:</span>
<p>
<span sid='49948' title='49948'>MURDEROUS ATTACK UPON SHERLOCK HOLMES</span>
<p>
<span sid='49949' title='49949'>I think I stood stunned for some moments. </span>
<span sid='49950' title='49950'>Then I have a confused recollection of snatching at a paper, of the remonstrance of the man, whom I had not paid, and, finally, of standing in the doorway of a chemist's shop while I turned up the fateful paragraph. </span>
<span sid='49951' title='49951'>This was how it ran:</span>
<p>
<span sid='49952' title='49952'>We learn with regret that Mr Sherlock Holmes, the well-known private detective, was the victim this morning of a murderous assault which has left him in a precarious position. </span>
<span sid='49953' title='49953'>There are no exact details to hand, but the event seems to have occurred about twelve o'clock in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Regent Street&t=h'>Regent Street</a>, outside the Café Royal. </span>
<span sid='49954' title='49954'>The attack was made by two men armed with sticks, and Mr Holmes was beaten about the head and body, receiving injuries which the doctors describe as most serious. </span>
<span sid='49955' title='49955'>He was carried to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Charing Cross&t=h'>Charing Cross</a> Hospital, and afterwards insisted upon being taken to his rooms in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='49956' title='49956'>The miscreants who attacked him appear to have been respectably dressed men, who escaped from the bystanders by passing through the Café Royal and out into <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Glasshouse Street&t=h'>Glasshouse Street</a> behind it. </span>
<span sid='49957' title='49957'>No doubt they belonged to that criminal fraternity which has so often had occasion to bewail the activity and ingenuity of the injured man.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49958' title='49958'>I need not say that my eyes had hardly glanced over the paragraph before I had sprung into a hansom and was on my way to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='49959' title='49959'>I found Sir Leslie Oakshott, the famous surgeon, in the hall and his brougham waiting at the kerb.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49960' title='49960'>'No immediate danger,' was his report. </span>
<span sid='49961' title='49961'>'Two lacerated scalp wounds and some considerable bruises. </span>
<span sid='49962' title='49962'>Several stitches have been necessary. </span>
<span sid='49963' title='49963'>Morphine has been injected and quiet is essential, but an interview of a few minutes would not be absolutely forbidden.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49964' title='49964'>With this permission I stole into the darkened room. </span>
<span sid='49965' title='49965'>The sufferer was wide awake, and I heard my name in a hoarse whisper. </span>
<span sid='49966' title='49966'>The blind was three-quarters down, but one ray of sunlight slanted through and struck the bandaged head of the injured man. </span>
<span sid='49967' title='49967'>A crimson patch had soaked through the white linen compress. </span>
<span sid='49968' title='49968'>I sat beside him and bent my head.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49969' title='49969'>'All right, Watson. </span>
<span sid='49970' title='49970'>Don't look so scared,' he muttered in a very weak voice. </span>
<span sid='49971' title='49971'>'It's not as bad as it seems.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49972' title='49972'>'Thank God for that!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49973' title='49973'>'I'm a bit of a single-stick expert, as you know. </span>
<span sid='49974' title='49974'>I took most of them on my guard. </span>
<span sid='49975' title='49975'>It was the second man that was too much for me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49976' title='49976'>'What can I do, Holmes? </span>
<span sid='49977' title='49977'>Of course, it was that damned fellow who set them on. </span>
<span sid='49978' title='49978'>I'll go and thrash the hide off him if you give the word.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49979' title='49979'>'Good old Watson! </span>
<span sid='49980' title='49980'>No, we can do nothing there unless the police lay their hands on the men. </span>
<span sid='49981' title='49981'>But their get-away had been well prepared. </span>
<span sid='49982' title='49982'>We may be sure of that. </span>
<span sid='49983' title='49983'>Wait a little. </span>
<span sid='49984' title='49984'>I have my plans. </span>
<span sid='49985' title='49985'>The first thing is to exaggerate my injuries. </span>
<span sid='49986' title='49986'>They'll come to you for news. </span>
<span sid='49987' title='49987'>Put it on thick, Watson. </span>
<span sid='49988' title='49988'>Lucky if I live the week out - concussion - delirium - what you like! </span>
<span sid='49989' title='49989'>You can't overdo it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49990' title='49990'>'But Sir Leslie Oakshott?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49991' title='49991'>'Oh, he's all right. </span>
<span sid='49992' title='49992'>He shall see the worst side of me. </span>
<span sid='49993' title='49993'>I'll look after that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49994' title='49994'>'Anything else?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49995' title='49995'>'Yes. </span>
<span sid='49996' title='49996'>Tell Shinwell Johnson to get that girl out of the way. </span>
<span sid='49997' title='49997'>Those beauties will be after her now. </span>
<span sid='49998' title='49998'>They know, of course, that she was with me in the case. </span>
<span sid='49999' title='49999'>If they dared to do me in it is not likely they will neglect her. </span>
<span sid='50000' title='50000'>That is urgent. </span>
<span sid='50001' title='50001'>Do it to-night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50002' title='50002'>'I'll go now. </span>
<span sid='50003' title='50003'>Anything more?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50004' title='50004'>'Put my pipe on the table - and the tobacco-slipper. </span>
<span sid='50005' title='50005'>Right! </span>
<span sid='50006' title='50006'>Come in each morning and we will plan our campaign.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50007' title='50007'>I arranged with Johnson that evening to take Miss Winter to a quiet suburb and see that she lay low until the danger was past.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50008' title='50008'>For six days the public were under the impression that Holmes was at the door of death. </span>
<span sid='50009' title='50009'>The bulletins were very grave and there were sinister paragraphs in the papers. </span>
<span sid='50010' title='50010'>My continual visits assured me that it was not so bad as that. </span>
<span sid='50011' title='50011'>His wiry constitution and his determined will were working wonders. </span>
<span sid='50012' title='50012'>He was recovering fast, and I had suspicions at times that he was really finding himself faster than he pretended, even to me. </span>
<span sid='50013' title='50013'>There was a curious secretive streak in the man which led to many dramatic effects, but left even his closest friend guessing as to what his exact plans might be. </span>
<span sid='50014' title='50014'>He pushed to an extreme the axiom that the only safe plotter was he who plotted alone. </span>
<span sid='50015' title='50015'>I was nearer him than anyone else, and yet I was always conscious of the gap between.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50016' title='50016'>On the seventh day the stitches were taken out, in spite of which there was a report of erysipelas in the evening papers. </span>
<span sid='50017' title='50017'>The same evening papers had an announcement which I was bound, sick or well, to carry to my friend. </span>
<span sid='50018' title='50018'>It was simply that among the passengers on the Cunard boat Ruritania, starting from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Liverpool&t=h'>Liverpool</a> on Friday, was the Baron Adelbert Gruner, who had some important financial business to settle in the States before his impending wedding to Miss Violet de Merville, only daughter of, etc., etc. </span>
<span sid='50019' title='50019'>Holmes listened to the news with a cold, concentrated look upon his pale face, which told me that it hit him hard.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50020' title='50020'>'Friday!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='50021' title='50021'>'Only three clear days. </span>
<span sid='50022' title='50022'>I believe the rascal wants to put himself out of danger's way. </span>
<span sid='50023' title='50023'>But he won't, Watson! </span>
<span sid='50024' title='50024'>By the Lord Harry, he won't! </span>
<span sid='50025' title='50025'>Now, Watson, I want you to do something for me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50026' title='50026'>'I am here to be used, Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50027' title='50027'>'Well, then, spend the next twenty-four hours in an intensive study of Chinese pottery.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50028' title='50028'>He gave no explanations and I asked for none. </span>
<span sid='50029' title='50029'>By long experience I had learned the wisdom of obedience. </span>
<span sid='50030' title='50030'>But when I had left his room I walked down <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>, revolving in my head how on earth I was to carry out so strange an order. </span>
<span sid='50031' title='50031'>Finally I drove to the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> Library in St James's Square, put the matter to my friend Lomax, the sub-librarian, and departed to my rooms with a goodly volume under my arm.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50032' title='50032'>It is said that the barrister who crams up a case with such care that he can examine an expert witness upon the Monday has forgotten all his forced knowledge before the Saturday. </span>
<span sid='50033' title='50033'>Certainly I should not like now to pose as an authority upon ceramics. </span>
<span sid='50034' title='50034'>And yet all that evening, and all that night with a short interval for rest, and all next morning I was sucking in knowledge and committing names to memory. </span>
<span sid='50035' title='50035'>There I learned of the hall-marks of the great artistdecorators, of the mystery of cyclical dates, the marks of the Hung-wu and the beauties of the Yung-lo, the writings of Tang-ying, and the glories of the primitive period of the Sung and the Yuan. </span>
<span sid='50036' title='50036'>I was charged with all this information when I called upon Holmes next evening. </span>
<span sid='50037' title='50037'>He was out of bed now, though you would not have guessed it from the published reports, and he sat with his much-bandaged head resting upon his hand in the depth of his favourite arm-chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50038' title='50038'>'Why, Holmes,' I said, 'if one believed the papers you are dying.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50039' title='50039'>'That', said he, 'is the very impression which I intended to convey. </span>
<span sid='50040' title='50040'>And now, Watson, have you learned your lessons?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50041' title='50041'>'At least I have tried to.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50042' title='50042'>'Good. </span>
<span sid='50043' title='50043'>You could keep up an intelligent conversation on the subject?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50044' title='50044'>'I believe I could.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50045' title='50045'>'Then hand me that little box from the mantelpiece.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50046' title='50046'>He opened the lid and took out a small object most carefully wrapped in some fine Eastern silk. </span>
<span sid='50047' title='50047'>This he unfolded, and disclosed a delicate little saucer of the most beautiful deep-blue colour.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50048' title='50048'>'It needs careful handling, Watson. </span>
<span sid='50049' title='50049'>This is the real eggshell pottery of the Ming dynasty. </span>
<span sid='50050' title='50050'>No finer piece ever passed through Christie's. </span>
<span sid='50051' title='50051'>A complete set of this would be worth a king's ransom - in fact, it is doubtful if there is a complete set outside the Imperial palace of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Peking&t=h'>Peking</a>. </span>
<span sid='50052' title='50052'>The sight of this would drive a real connoisseur wild.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50053' title='50053'>'What am I to do with it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50054' title='50054'>Holmes handed me a card upon which was printed: </span>
<span sid='50055' title='50055'>'Dr Hill Barton, 369, Half Moon Street.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50056' title='50056'>'That is your name for the evening, Watson. </span>
<span sid='50057' title='50057'>You will call upon Baron Gruner. </span>
<span sid='50058' title='50058'>I know something of his habits, and at half-past eight he would probably be disengaged. </span>
<span sid='50059' title='50059'>A note will tell him in advance that you are about to call, and you will say that you are bringing him a specimen of an absolutely unique set of Ming china. </span>
<span sid='50060' title='50060'>You may as well be a medical man, since that is a part which you can play without duplicity. </span>
<span sid='50061' title='50061'>You are a collector, this set has come your way, you have heard of the Baron's interest in the subject, and you are not averse to selling at a price.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50062' title='50062'>'What price?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50063' title='50063'>'Well asked, Watson. </span>
<span sid='50064' title='50064'>You would certainly fall down badly if you did not know the value of your own wares. </span>
<span sid='50065' title='50065'>This saucer was got for me by Sir James, and comes, I understand, from the collection of his client. </span>
<span sid='50066' title='50066'>You will not exaggerate if you say that it could hardly be matched in the world.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50067' title='50067'>'I could perhaps suggest that the set should be valued by an expert.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50068' title='50068'>'Excellent, Watson! </span>
<span sid='50069' title='50069'>You scintillate today. </span>
<span sid='50070' title='50070'>Suggest Christie or Sotheby. </span>
<span sid='50071' title='50071'>Your delicacy prevents your putting a price for yourself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50072' title='50072'>'But if he won't see me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50073' title='50073'>'Oh, yes, he will see you. </span>
<span sid='50074' title='50074'>He has the collection mania in its most acute form - and especially on this subject, on which he is an acknowledged authority. </span>
<span sid='50075' title='50075'>Sit down, Watson, and I will dictate the letter. </span>
<span sid='50076' title='50076'>No answer needed. </span>
<span sid='50077' title='50077'>You will merely say that you are coming, and why.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50078' title='50078'>It was an admirable document, short, courteous, and stimulating to the curiosity of the connoisseur. </span>
<span sid='50079' title='50079'>A district messenger was duly dispatched with it. </span>
<span sid='50080' title='50080'>On the same evening, with the precious saucer in my hand and the card of Dr Hill Barton in my pocket, I set off on my own adventure.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50081' title='50081'>The beautiful house and grounds indicated that Baron Gruner was, as Sir James had said, a man of considerable wealth. </span>
<span sid='50082' title='50082'>A long winding drive, with banks of rare shrubs on either side, opened out into a great gravelled square adorned with statues. </span>
<span sid='50083' title='50083'>The place had been built by a South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>n gold king in the days of the great boom, and the long, low house with the turrets at the corners, though an architectural nightmare, was imposing in its size and solidity. </span>
<span sid='50084' title='50084'>A butler who would have adorned a bench of Bishops showed me in, and handed me over to a plush-clad footman, who ushered me into the Baron's presence.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50085' title='50085'>He was standing at the open front of a great case which stood between the windows, and which contained part of his Chinese collection. </span>
<span sid='50086' title='50086'>He turned as I entered with a small brown vase in his hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50087' title='50087'>'Pray sit down, doctor,' said he. </span>
<span sid='50088' title='50088'>'I was looking over my own treasures and wondering whether I could really afford to add to them. </span>
<span sid='50089' title='50089'>This little Tang specimen, which dates from the seventh century, would probably interest you. </span>
<span sid='50090' title='50090'>I am sure you never saw finer workmanship or a richer glaze. </span>
<span sid='50091' title='50091'>Have you the Ming saucer with you of which you spoke?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50092' title='50092'>I carefully unpacked it and handed it to him. </span>
<span sid='50093' title='50093'>He seated himself at his desk, pulled over the lamp, for it was growing dark, and set himself to examine it. </span>
<span sid='50094' title='50094'>As he did so the yellow light beat upon his own features, and I was able to study them at my ease.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50095' title='50095'>He was certainly a remarkably handsome man. </span>
<span sid='50096' title='50096'>His <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>an reputation for beauty was fully deserved. </span>
<span sid='50097' title='50097'>In figure he was not more than of middle size, but was built upon graceful and active lines. </span>
<span sid='50098' title='50098'>His face was swarthy, almost Oriental, with large, dark, languorous eyes which might easily hold an irresistible fascination for women. </span>
<span sid='50099' title='50099'>His hair and moustache were raven black, the latter short, pointed, and carefully waxed. </span>
<span sid='50100' title='50100'>His features were regular and pleasing, save only his straight, thin-lipped mouth. </span>
<span sid='50101' title='50101'>If ever I saw a murderer's mouth it was there - a cruel, hard gash in the face, compressed, inexorable, and terrible. </span>
<span sid='50102' title='50102'>He was ill-advised to train his moustache away from it, for it was Nature's danger-signal, set as a warning to his victims. </span>
<span sid='50103' title='50103'>His voice was engaging and his manners perfect. </span>
<span sid='50104' title='50104'>In age I should have put him at little over thirty, though his record afterwards showed that he was forty-two.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50105' title='50105'>'Very fine - very fine indeed!' he said at last. </span>
<span sid='50106' title='50106'>'And you say you have a set of six to correspond. </span>
<span sid='50107' title='50107'>What puzzles me is that I should not have heard of such magnificent specimens. </span>
<span sid='50108' title='50108'>I only know of one in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> to match this, and it is certainly not likely to be in the market. </span>
<span sid='50109' title='50109'>Would it be indiscreet if I were to ask you, Dr Hill Barton, how you obtained this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50110' title='50110'>'Does it really matter?' I asked, with as careless an air as I could muster. </span>
<span sid='50111' title='50111'>'You can see that the piece is genuine, and, as to the value, I am content to take an expert's valuation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50112' title='50112'>'Very mysterious,' said he, with a quick suspicious flash, of his dark eyes. </span>
<span sid='50113' title='50113'>'In dealing with objects of such value, one naturally wishes to know all about the transaction. </span>
<span sid='50114' title='50114'>That the piece is genuine is certain. </span>
<span sid='50115' title='50115'>I have no doubts at all about that. </span>
<span sid='50116' title='50116'>But suppose - I am bound to take every possibility into account - that it should prove afterwards that you had no right to sell?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50117' title='50117'>'I would guarantee you against any claim of the sort.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50118' title='50118'>'That, of course, would open up the question as to what your guarantee was worth.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50119' title='50119'>'My bankers would answer that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50120' title='50120'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='50121' title='50121'>And yet the whole transaction strikes me as rather unusual.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50122' title='50122'>'You can do business or not,' said I, with indifference. </span>
<span sid='50123' title='50123'>'I have given you the first offer as I understood that you were a connoisseur, but I shall have no difficulty in other quarters.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50124' title='50124'>'Who told you I was a connoisseur?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50125' title='50125'>'I was aware that you had written a book upon the subject.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50126' title='50126'>'Have you read the book?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50127' title='50127'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50128' title='50128'>'Dear me, this becomes more and more difficult for me to understand! </span>
<span sid='50129' title='50129'>You are a connoisseur and collector with a very valuable piece in your collection, and yet you have never troubled to consult the one book which would have told you of the real meaning and value of what you held. </span>
<span sid='50130' title='50130'>How do you explain that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50131' title='50131'>'I am a very busy man. </span>
<span sid='50132' title='50132'>I am a doctor in practice.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50133' title='50133'>'That is no answer. </span>
<span sid='50134' title='50134'>If a man has a hobby he follows it up, whatever his other pursuits may be. </span>
<span sid='50135' title='50135'>You said in your note that you were a connoisseur.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50136' title='50136'>'So I am.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50137' title='50137'>'Might I ask you a few questions to test you? </span>
<span sid='50138' title='50138'>I am obliged to tell you, doctor - if you are indeed a doctor - that the incident becomes more and more suspicious. </span>
<span sid='50139' title='50139'>I would ask you what do you know of the Emperor Shomu and how do you associate him with the Shoso-in near <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Nara&t=h'>Nara</a>? </span>
<span sid='50140' title='50140'>Dear me, does that puzzle you? </span>
<span sid='50141' title='50141'>Tell me a little about the Northern Wei dynasty and its place in the history of ceramics.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50142' title='50142'>I sprang from my chair in simulated anger.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50143' title='50143'>'This is intolerable, sir,' said I. </span>
<span sid='50144' title='50144'>'I came here to do you a favour, and not to be examined as if I were a schoolboy. </span>
<span sid='50145' title='50145'>My knowledge on these subjects may be second only to your own, but I certainly shall not answer questions which have been put in so offensive a way.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50146' title='50146'>He looked at me steadily. </span>
<span sid='50147' title='50147'>The languor had gone from his eyes. </span>
<span sid='50148' title='50148'>They suddenly glared. </span>
<span sid='50149' title='50149'>There was a gleam of teeth from between those cruel lips.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50150' title='50150'>'What is the game? </span>
<span sid='50151' title='50151'>You are here as a spy. </span>
<span sid='50152' title='50152'>You are an emissary of Holmes. </span>
<span sid='50153' title='50153'>This is a trick that you are playing upon me. </span>
<span sid='50154' title='50154'>The fellow is dying, I hear, so he sends his tools to keep watch upon me. </span>
<span sid='50155' title='50155'>You've made your way in here without leave, and by God! </span>
<span sid='50156' title='50156'>you may find it harder to get out than to get in.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50157' title='50157'>He had sprung to his feet, and I stepped back, bracing myself for an attack, for the man was beside himself with rage. </span>
<span sid='50158' title='50158'>He may have suspected me from the first, certainly this cross-examination had shown him the truth, but it was clear that I could not hope to deceive him. </span>
<span sid='50159' title='50159'>He dived his hand into a side-drawer and rummaged furiously. </span>
<span sid='50160' title='50160'>Then something struck upon his ear, for he stood listening intently.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50161' title='50161'>'Ah!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='50162' title='50162'>'Ah!' and dashed into the room behind him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50163' title='50163'>Two steps took me to the open door, and my mind will ever carry a clear picture of the scene within. </span>
<span sid='50164' title='50164'>The window leading out to the garden was wide open. </span>
<span sid='50165' title='50165'>Beside it, looking like some terrible ghost, his head girt with bloody bandages, his face drawn and white, stood Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='50166' title='50166'>The next instant he was through the gap, and I heard the crash of his body among the laurel bushes outside. </span>
<span sid='50167' title='50167'>With a howl of rage the master of the house rushed after him to the open window.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50168' title='50168'>And then! </span>
<span sid='50169' title='50169'>It was done in an instant, and yet I clearly saw it. </span>
<span sid='50170' title='50170'>An arm - a woman's arm - shot out from among the leaves. </span>
<span sid='50171' title='50171'>At the same instant the Baron uttered a horrible cry - a yell which will always ring in my memory. </span>
<span sid='50172' title='50172'>He clapped his two hands to his face and rushed round the room, beating his head horribly against the walls. </span>
<span sid='50173' title='50173'>Then he fell upon the carpet, rolling and writhing, while scream after scream resounded through the house.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50174' title='50174'>'Water! </span>
<span sid='50175' title='50175'>For God's sake, water!' was his cry.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50176' title='50176'>I seized a carafe from a side-table and rushed to his aid. </span>
<span sid='50177' title='50177'>At the same moment the butler and several footmen ran in from the hall. </span>
<span sid='50178' title='50178'>I remember that one of them fainted as I knelt by the injured man and turned that awful face to the light of the lamp. </span>
<span sid='50179' title='50179'>The vitriol was eating into it everywhere and dripping from the ears and the chin. </span>
<span sid='50180' title='50180'>One eye was already white and glazed. </span>
<span sid='50181' title='50181'>The other was red and inflamed. </span>
<span sid='50182' title='50182'>The features which I had admired a few minutes before were now like some beautiful painting over which the artist has passed a wet and foul sponge. </span>
<span sid='50183' title='50183'>They were blurred, discoloured, inhuman, terrible.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50184' title='50184'>In a few words I explained exactly what had occurred, so far as the vitriol attack was concerned. </span>
<span sid='50185' title='50185'>Some had climbed through the window and others had rushed out on to the lawn, but it was dark and it had begun to rain. </span>
<span sid='50186' title='50186'>Between his screams the victim raged and raved against the avenger. </span>
<span sid='50187' title='50187'>'It was that hell-cat, Kitty Winter!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='50188' title='50188'>'Oh, the she-devil! </span>
<span sid='50189' title='50189'>She shall pay for it! </span>
<span sid='50190' title='50190'>She shall pay! </span>
<span sid='50191' title='50191'>Oh, God in heaven, this pain is more than I can bear!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50192' title='50192'>I bathed his face in oil, put cotton wadding on the raw surfaces, and administered a hypodermic of morphia. </span>
<span sid='50193' title='50193'>All suspicion of me had passed from his mind in the presence of this shock, and he clung to my hands as if I might have the power even yet to clear those dead-fish eyes which gazed up at me. </span>
<span sid='50194' title='50194'>I could have wept over the ruin had I not remembered very clearly the vile life which had led up to so hideous a change. </span>
<span sid='50195' title='50195'>It was loathsome to feel the pawing of his burning hands, and I was relieved when his family surgeon, closely followed by a specialist, came to relieve me of my charge. </span>
<span sid='50196' title='50196'>An inspector of police had also arrived, and to him I handed my real card. </span>
<span sid='50197' title='50197'>It would have been useless as well as foolish to do otherwise, for I was nearly as well known by sight at the Yard as Holmes himself. </span>
<span sid='50198' title='50198'>Then I left that house of gloom and terror. </span>
<span sid='50199' title='50199'>Within an hour I was at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50200' title='50200'>Holmes was seated in his familiar chair, looking very pale and exhausted. </span>
<span sid='50201' title='50201'>Apart from his injuries, even his iron nerves had been shocked by the events of the evening, and he listened with horror to my account of the Baron's transformation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50202' title='50202'>'The wages of sin, Watson - the wages of sin!' said he. </span>
<span sid='50203' title='50203'>'Sooner or later it will always come. </span>
<span sid='50204' title='50204'>God knows, there was sin enough,' he added, taking up a brown volume from the table. </span>
<span sid='50205' title='50205'>'Here is the book the woman talked of. </span>
<span sid='50206' title='50206'>If this will not break off the marriage, nothing ever could. </span>
<span sid='50207' title='50207'>But it will, Watson. </span>
<span sid='50208' title='50208'>It must. </span>
<span sid='50209' title='50209'>No self-respecting woman could stand it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50210' title='50210'>'It is his love diary?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50211' title='50211'>'Or his lust diary. </span>
<span sid='50212' title='50212'>Call it what you will. </span>
<span sid='50213' title='50213'>The moment the woman told us of it I realized what a tremendous weapon was there, if we could but lay our hands on it. </span>
<span sid='50214' title='50214'>I said nothing at the time to indicate my thoughts, for this woman might have given it away. </span>
<span sid='50215' title='50215'>But I brooded over it. </span>
<span sid='50216' title='50216'>Then this assault upon me gave me the chance of letting the Baron think that no precautions need be taken against me. </span>
<span sid='50217' title='50217'>That was all to the good. </span>
<span sid='50218' title='50218'>I would have waited a little longer, but his visit to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a> forced my hand. </span>
<span sid='50219' title='50219'>He would never have left so compromising a document behind him. </span>
<span sid='50220' title='50220'>Therefore we had to act at once. </span>
<span sid='50221' title='50221'>Burglary at night is impossible. </span>
<span sid='50222' title='50222'>He takes precautions. </span>
<span sid='50223' title='50223'>But there was a chance in the evening if I could only be sure that his attention was engaged. </span>
<span sid='50224' title='50224'>That was where you and your blue saucer came in. </span>
<span sid='50225' title='50225'>But I had to be sure of the position of the book, and I knew I had only a few minutes in which to act, for my time was limited by your knowledge of Chinese pottery. </span>
<span sid='50226' title='50226'>Therefore I gathered the girl up at the last moment. </span>
<span sid='50227' title='50227'>How could I guess what the little packet was that she carried so carefully under her cloak? </span>
<span sid='50228' title='50228'>I thought she had come altogether on my business, but it seems she had some of her own.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50229' title='50229'>'He guessed I came from you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50230' title='50230'>'I feared he would. </span>
<span sid='50231' title='50231'>But you held him in play just long enough for me to get the book, though not long enough for an unobserved escape. </span>
<span sid='50232' title='50232'>Ah, Sir James, I am very glad you have come!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50233' title='50233'>Our courtly friend had appeared in answer to a previous summons. </span>
<span sid='50234' title='50234'>He listened with the deepest attention to Holmes's account of what had occurred.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50235' title='50235'>'You have done wonders - wonders!' he cried, when he had heard the narrative. </span>
<span sid='50236' title='50236'>'But if these injuries are as terrible as Dr Watson describes, then surely our purpose of thwarting the marriage is sufficiently gained without the use of this horrible book.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50237' title='50237'>Holmes shook his head.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50238' title='50238'>'Women of the de Merville type do not act like that. </span>
<span sid='50239' title='50239'>She would love him the more as a disfigured martyr. </span>
<span sid='50240' title='50240'>No, no. </span>
<span sid='50241' title='50241'>It is his moral side, not his physical, which we have to destroy. </span>
<span sid='50242' title='50242'>That book will bring her back to earth - and I know nothing else that could. </span>
<span sid='50243' title='50243'>It is in his own writing. </span>
<span sid='50244' title='50244'>She cannot get past it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50245' title='50245'>Sir James carried away both it and the precious saucer. </span>
<span sid='50246' title='50246'>As I was myself overdue, I went down with him into the street. </span>
<span sid='50247' title='50247'>A brougham was waiting for him. </span>
<span sid='50248' title='50248'>He sprang in, gave a hurried order to the cockaded coachman, and drove swiftly away. </span>
<span sid='50249' title='50249'>He flung his overcoat half out of the window to cover the armorial bearings upon the panel, but I had seen them in the glare of our fanlight none the less. </span>
<span sid='50250' title='50250'>I gasped with surprise. </span>
<span sid='50251' title='50251'>Then I turned back and ascended the stair to Holmes's room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50252' title='50252'>'I have found out who our client is,' I cried, bursting with my great news. </span>
<span sid='50253' title='50253'>'Why, Holmes, it is-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50254' title='50254'>'It is a loyal friend and a chivalrous gentleman,' said Holmes, holding up a restraining hand. </span>
<span sid='50255' title='50255'>'Let that now and for ever be enough for us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50256' title='50256'>I do not know how the incriminating book was used. </span>
<span sid='50257' title='50257'>Sir James may have managed it. </span>
<span sid='50258' title='50258'>Or it is more probable that so delicate a task was entrusted to the young lady's father. </span>
<span sid='50259' title='50259'>The effect, at any rate, was all that could be desired. </span>
<span sid='50260' title='50260'>Three days later appeared a paragraph in The Morning Post to say that the marriage between Baron Adelbert Gruner and Miss Violet de Merville would not take place. </span>
<span sid='50261' title='50261'>The same paper had the first police-court hearing of the proceedings against Miss Kitty Winter on the grave charge of vitriol-throwing. </span>
<span sid='50262' title='50262'>Such extenuating circumstances came out in the trial that the sentence, as will be remembered, was the lowest that was possible for such an offence. </span>
<span sid='50263' title='50263'>Sherlock Holmes was threatened with a prosecution for burglary, but when an object is good and a client is sufficiently illustrious, even the rigid British law becomes human and elastic. </span>
<span sid='50264' title='50264'>My friend has not yet stood in the dock.</span>
