<p>
<span sid='30595' title='30595'>'My dear fellow,' said Sherlock Holmes, as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>, 'life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. </span>
<span sid='30596' title='30596'>We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. </span>
<span sid='30597' title='30597'>If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outré results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30598' title='30598'>'And yet I am not convinced of it,' I answered, 'The cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. </span>
<span sid='30599' title='30599'>We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30600' title='30600'>'A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect,' remarked Holmes. </span>
<span sid='30601' title='30601'>This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid perhaps upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. </span>
<span sid='30602' title='30602'>Depend upon it there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30603' title='30603'>I smiled and shook my head, 'I can quite understand you thinking so,' I said. </span>
<span sid='30604' title='30604'>Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. </span>
<span sid='30605' title='30605'>But here' - I picked up the morning paper from the ground - 'let us put it to a practical test. </span>
<span sid='30606' title='30606'>Here is the first heading upon which I come. </span>
<span sid='30607' title='30607'>"A husband's cruelty to his wife." </span>
<span sid='30608' title='30608'>There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. </span>
<span sid='30609' title='30609'>There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. </span>
<span sid='30610' title='30610'>The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30611' title='30611'>'Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,' said Holmes, taking the paper, and glancing his eye down it. </span>
<span sid='30612' title='30612'>'This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it. </span>
<span sid='30613' title='30613'>The husband was a teetotaller, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which you will allow is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. </span>
<span sid='30614' title='30614'>Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30615' title='30615'>He held out his snuff-box of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid. </span>
<span sid='30616' title='30616'>Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30617' title='30617'>'Ah,' said he, 'I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. </span>
<span sid='30618' title='30618'>It is a little souvenir from the King of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bohemia&t=h'>Bohemia</a> in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30619' title='30619'>'And the ring?' I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30620' title='30620'>'It was from the reigning family of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Holland&t=h'>Holland</a>, though the matter in which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30621' title='30621'>'And have you any on hand just now?' I asked with interest.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30622' title='30622'>'Some ten or twelve, but none which presents any feature of interest. </span>
<span sid='30623' title='30623'>They are important, you understand, without being interesting. </span>
<span sid='30624' title='30624'>Indeed, I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation. </span>
<span sid='30625' title='30625'>The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime, the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. </span>
<span sid='30626' title='30626'>In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Marseilles&t=h'>Marseilles</a>, there is nothing which presents any feature of interests. </span>
<span sid='30627' title='30627'>It is possible, however, that I may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30628' title='30628'>He had risen from his chair, and was standing between the parted blinds, gazing down into the dull, neutral-tinted <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> street. </span>
<span sid='30629' title='30629'>Looking over his shoulder I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess-of-<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Devonshire&t=h'>Devonshire</a> fashion over her ear. </span>
<span sid='30630' title='30630'>From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated backwards and forwards, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons. </span>
<span sid='30631' title='30631'>Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30632' title='30632'>'I have seen those symptoms before,' said Holmes, throwing his cigarette into the fire. </span>
<span sid='30633' title='30633'>Oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire du coeur. </span>
<span sid='30634' title='30634'>She would like advice, but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication. </span>
<span sid='30635' title='30635'>And yet even here we may discriminate. </span>
<span sid='30636' title='30636'>When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. </span>
<span sid='30637' title='30637'>Here we may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved. </span>
<span sid='30638' title='30638'>But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30639' title='30639'>As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchantman behind a tiny pilot boat. </span>
<span sid='30640' title='30640'>Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which she was remarkable, and having closed the door, and bowed her into an armchair, he looked over her in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30641' title='30641'>'Do you not find,' he said, 'that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30642' title='30642'>'I did at first,' she answered, 'but now I know where the letters are without looking.' </span>
<span sid='30643' title='30643'>Then, suddenly realizing the full purport of his words, she gave a violent start, and looked up with fear and astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. </span>
<span sid='30644' title='30644'>'You've heard about me, Mr Holmes,' she cried, 'else how could you know all that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30645' title='30645'>'Never mind,' said Holmes, laughing, 'it is my business to know things. </span>
<span sid='30646' title='30646'>Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. </span>
<span sid='30647' title='30647'>If not, why should you come to consult me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30648' title='30648'>'I came to you, sir because I heard of you from Mrs Etherege, whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead. </span>
<span sid='30649' title='30649'>Oh, Mr Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. </span>
<span sid='30650' title='30650'>I'm not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr Hosmer Angel.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30651' title='30651'>'Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?' asked Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together, and his eyes to the ceiling.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30652' title='30652'>Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland. </span>
<span sid='30653' title='30653'>'Yes, I did bang out of the house,' she said, 'for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr Windibank - that is, my father - took it all.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30654' title='30654'>He would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing, and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away to you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30655' title='30655'>'Your father?' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='30656' title='30656'>'Your step-father, surely, since the name is different?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30657' title='30657'>'Yes, my step-father. </span>
<span sid='30658' title='30658'>I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30659' title='30659'>'And your mother is alive?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30660' title='30660'>'Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. </span>
<span sid='30661' title='30661'>I wasn't best pleased, Mr Holmes, when she married again so soon after father's death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. </span>
<span sid='30662' title='30662'>Father was a plumber in the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Tottenham Court Road&t=h'>Tottenham Court Road</a>, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr Hardy, the foreman, but when Mr Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. </span>
<span sid='30663' title='30663'>They got four thousand seven hundred for goodwill and interest, which wasn't near as much as father could have got if he had been alive.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30664' title='30664'>I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30665' title='30665'>'Your own little income,' he asked, 'does it come out of the business?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30666' title='30666'>'Oh, no, sir, it is quite separate, and was left me by my uncle Ned in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Auckland&t=h'>Auckland</a>. </span>
<span sid='30667' title='30667'>It is in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=New Zealand&t=h'>New Zealand</a> Stock, paying 4 1/2 per cent. </span>
<span sid='30668' title='30668'>Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30669' title='30669'>'You interest me extremely,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='30670' title='30670'>'And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. </span>
<span sid='30671' title='30671'>I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about sixty pounds.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30672' title='30672'>'I could do with much less than that, Mr Holmes, but you understand that as long as I live at home I don't wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. </span>
<span sid='30673' title='30673'>Of course that is only just for the time. </span>
<span sid='30674' title='30674'>Mr Windibank draws my interest every quarter, and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. </span>
<span sid='30675' title='30675'>It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twentysheets in a day.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30676' title='30676'>'You have made your position very clear to me,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='30677' title='30677'>'This is my friend, Dr Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. </span>
<span sid='30678' title='30678'>Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr Hosmer Angel.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30679' title='30679'>A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face, and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket. </span>
<span sid='30680' title='30680'>'I met him first at the gasfitters ball, she said. </span>
<span sid='30681' title='30681'>They used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. </span>
<span sid='30682' title='30682'>Mr Windibank did not wish us to go. </span>
<span sid='30683' title='30683'>He never did wish us to go anywhere. </span>
<span sid='30684' title='30684'>He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. </span>
<span sid='30685' title='30685'>But this time I was set on going, and I would go, for what right had he to prevent? </span>
<span sid='30686' title='30686'>He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father's friends were to be there. </span>
<span sid='30687' title='30687'>And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. </span>
<span sid='30688' title='30688'>At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a> upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr Hosmer Angel.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30689' title='30689'>'I suppose,' said Holmes, 'that when Mr Windibank came back from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>, he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30690' title='30690'>'Oh, well, he was very good about it. </span>
<span sid='30691' title='30691'>He laughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30692' title='30692'>'I see. </span>
<span sid='30693' title='30693'>Then at the gasfitters' ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr Hosmer Angel.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30694' title='30694'>'Yes, sir. </span>
<span sid='30695' title='30695'>I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him - that is to say, Mr Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30696' title='30696'>'No?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30697' title='30697'>'Well, you know, father didn't like anything of the sort. </span>
<span sid='30698' title='30698'>He wouldn't have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. </span>
<span sid='30699' title='30699'>But then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30700' title='30700'>'But how about Mr Hosmer Angel? </span>
<span sid='30701' title='30701'>Did he make no attempt to see you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30702' title='30702'>'Well, father was going off to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a> again in a week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone. </span>
<span sid='30703' title='30703'>We would write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. </span>
<span sid='30704' title='30704'>I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30705' title='30705'>'Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30706' title='30706'>'Oh, yes, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='30707' title='30707'>We were engaged after the first walk that we took. </span>
<span sid='30708' title='30708'>Hosmer - Mr Angel - was a cashier in an office in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Leadenhall Street&t=h'>Leadenhall Street</a> - and -'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30709' title='30709'>'What office?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30710' title='30710'>'That's the worst of it. </span>
<span sid='30711' title='30711'>Mr Holmes, I don't know.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30712' title='30712'>'Where did he live then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30713' title='30713'>'He slept on the premises.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30714' title='30714'>'And you don't know his address?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30715' title='30715'>'No - except that it was <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Leadenhall Street&t=h'>Leadenhall Street</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30716' title='30716'>'Where did you address your letters, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30717' title='30717'>'To the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Leadenhall Street&t=h'>Leadenhall Street</a> Post Office, to be left till called for. </span>
<span sid='30718' title='30718'>He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn't have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. </span>
<span sid='30719' title='30719'>That will just show you how fond he was of me. </span>
<span sid='30720' title='30720'>Mr Holmes, and the little things that he would think of.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30721' title='30721'>'It was most suggestive,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='30722' title='30722'>'It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. </span>
<span sid='30723' title='30723'>Can you remember any other little things about Mr Hosmer Angel?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30724' title='30724'>'He was a very shy man, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='30725' title='30725'>He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. </span>
<span sid='30726' title='30726'>Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. </span>
<span sid='30727' title='30727'>Even his voice was gentle. </span>
<span sid='30728' title='30728'>He'd had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating whispering fashion of speech. </span>
<span sid='30729' title='30729'>He was always well-dressed, very neat and plain, but his eves were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30730' title='30730'>'Well, and what happened when Mr Windibank, your step-father, returned to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30731' title='30731'>'Mr Hosmer Angel came to the house again, and proposed that we should marry before father came back. </span>
<span sid='30732' title='30732'>He was in dreadful earnest, and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always be true to him. </span>
<span sid='30733' title='30733'>Mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. </span>
<span sid='30734' title='30734'>Mother was all in his favour from the first, and was even fonder of him than I was. </span>
<span sid='30735' title='30735'>Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. </span>
<span sid='30736' title='30736'>I didn't quite like that, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='30737' title='30737'>It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn't want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bordeaux&t=h'>Bordeaux</a>, where the Company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30738' title='30738'>'It missed him then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30739' title='30739'>'Yes, sir, for he had started to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> just before it arrived.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30740' title='30740'>'Ha! that was unfortunate. </span>
<span sid='30741' title='30741'>Your wedding was arranged, then, for the Friday. </span>
<span sid='30742' title='30742'>Was it to be in church?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30743' title='30743'>'Yes, sir, but very quietly. </span>
<span sid='30744' title='30744'>It was to be at St Saviour's, near <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=King's Cross&t=h'>King's Cross</a>, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St Pancras Hotel. </span>
<span sid='30745' title='30745'>Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us, he put us both into it, and stepped himself into a four-wheeler which happened to be the only other cab in the street. </span>
<span sid='30746' title='30746'>We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked, there was no one there! </span>
<span sid='30747' title='30747'>The cabman said he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. </span>
<span sid='30748' title='30748'>That was last Friday, Mr Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30749' title='30749'>'It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30750' title='30750'>'Oh no, sir! </span>
<span sid='30751' title='30751'>He was too good and kind to leave me so. </span>
<span sid='30752' title='30752'>Why, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. </span>
<span sid='30753' title='30753'>It seemed strange talk for wedding morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30754' title='30754'>'Most certainly it does. </span>
<span sid='30755' title='30755'>Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30756' title='30756'>'Yes, sir. </span>
<span sid='30757' title='30757'>I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so. </span>
<span sid='30758' title='30758'>And then I think that what he foresaw happened.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30759' title='30759'>'But you have no notion as to what it could have been?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30760' title='30760'>'None.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30761' title='30761'>'One more question. </span>
<span sid='30762' title='30762'>How did your mother take the matter?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30763' title='30763'>'She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30764' title='30764'>'And your father? </span>
<span sid='30765' title='30765'>Did you tell him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30766' title='30766'>'Yes, and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. </span>
<span sid='30767' title='30767'>As he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me? </span>
<span sid='30768' title='30768'>Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason; but Hosmer was very independent about money, and never would look at a shilling of mine. </span>
<span sid='30769' title='30769'>And yet what could have happened? </span>
<span sid='30770' title='30770'>And why could he not write? </span>
<span sid='30771' title='30771'>Oh, it drives me half mad to think of! and I can't sleep a wink at night.' </span>
<span sid='30772' title='30772'>She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff, and began to sob heavily into it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30773' title='30773'>'I shall glance into the case for you,' said Holmes, rising, 'and I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. </span>
<span sid='30774' title='30774'>Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it further. </span>
<span sid='30775' title='30775'>Above all, try to let Mr Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he done from your life.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30776' title='30776'>'Then you don't think I'll see him again?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30777' title='30777'>'I fear not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30778' title='30778'>'Then what has happened to him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30779' title='30779'>'You will leave that question in my hands. </span>
<span sid='30780' title='30780'>I should like an accurate description of him, and any letters of his which you can spare.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30781' title='30781'>'I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle,' said she.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30782' title='30782'>'Here is the slip, and here are four letters from him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30783' title='30783'>'Thank you. </span>
<span sid='30784' title='30784'>And your address?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30785' title='30785'>'31 Lyon Place, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Camberwell&t=h'>Camberwell</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30786' title='30786'>'Mr Angel's address you never had, I understand. </span>
<span sid='30787' title='30787'>Where is your father's place of business?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30788' title='30788'>'He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Fenchurch Street&t=h'>Fenchurch Street</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30789' title='30789'>'Thank you. </span>
<span sid='30790' title='30790'>You have made your statement very clearly. </span>
<span sid='30791' title='30791'>You will leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. </span>
<span sid='30792' title='30792'>Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your life.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30793' title='30793'>'You are very kind, Mr Holmes, but I cannot do that. </span>
<span sid='30794' title='30794'>I shall be true to Hosmer. </span>
<span sid='30795' title='30795'>He shall find me ready when he comes back.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30796' title='30796'>For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect. </span>
<span sid='30797' title='30797'>She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table, and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30798' title='30798'>Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upwards to the ceiling. </span>
<span sid='30799' title='30799'>Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30800' title='30800'>'Quite an interesting study, that maiden,' he observed. </span>
<span sid='30801' title='30801'>'I found her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one. </span>
<span sid='30802' title='30802'>You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Andover&t=h'>Andover</a> in '77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year. </span>
<span sid='30803' title='30803'>Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me. </span>
<span sid='30804' title='30804'>But the maiden herself was most instructive.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30805' title='30805'>'You appear to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me,' I remarked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30806' title='30806'>'Not invisible, but unnoticed, Watson. </span>
<span sid='30807' title='30807'>You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important. </span>
<span sid='30808' title='30808'>I can never bring you to realize the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumbnails, or the great issues that may hang from a bootlace. </span>
<span sid='30809' title='30809'>Now what did you gather from that woman's appearance? </span>
<span sid='30810' title='30810'>Describe it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30811' title='30811'>'Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red. </span>
<span sid='30812' title='30812'>Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. </span>
<span sid='30813' title='30813'>Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. </span>
<span sid='30814' title='30814'>Her gloves were greyish, and were worn through at the right forefinger. </span>
<span sid='30815' title='30815'>Her boots I didn't observe. </span>
<span sid='30816' title='30816'>She had small, round, hanging gold ear-rings, and a general air of being fairly well to do, in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30817' title='30817'>Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30818' title='30818'>'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. </span>
<span sid='30819' title='30819'>You have really done very well indeed. </span>
<span sid='30820' title='30820'>It is true that you have missed everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for colour. </span>
<span sid='30821' title='30821'>Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. </span>
<span sid='30822' title='30822'>My first glance is always at a woman's sleeve. </span>
<span sid='30823' title='30823'>In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. </span>
<span sid='30824' title='30824'>As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. </span>
<span sid='30825' title='30825'>The double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined. </span>
<span sid='30826' title='30826'>The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this was. </span>
<span sid='30827' title='30827'>I then glanced at her face, and observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30828' title='30828'>'It surprised me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30829' title='30829'>'But, surely, it was very obvious. </span>
<span sid='30830' title='30830'>I was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones, the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. </span>
<span sid='30831' title='30831'>One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. </span>
<span sid='30832' title='30832'>Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30833' title='30833'>'And what else?' I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my friend's incisive reasoning.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30834' title='30834'>'I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home, but after being fully dressed. </span>
<span sid='30835' title='30835'>You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. </span>
<span sid='30836' title='30836'>She had written in a hurry, and dipped her pen too deep. </span>
<span sid='30837' title='30837'>It must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger. </span>
<span sid='30838' title='30838'>All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. </span>
<span sid='30839' title='30839'>Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr Hosmer Angel?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30840' title='30840'>I held the little printed slip to the light. </span>
<span sid='30841' title='30841'>'Missing,' it said, 'on the morning of the 14th, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. </span>
<span sid='30842' title='30842'>About 5 ft 7 in in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side whiskers and moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. </span>
<span sid='30843' title='30843'>Was dressed, when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots. </span>
<span sid='30844' title='30844'>Known to have been employed in an office in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Leadenhall Street&t=h'>Leadenhall Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='30845' title='30845'>Anybody bringing, etc., etc.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30846' title='30846'>'That will do,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='30847' title='30847'>'As to the letters,' he continued, glancing over them, 'they are very commonplace.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30848' title='30848'>Absolutely no clue in them to Mr Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. </span>
<span sid='30849' title='30849'>There is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30850' title='30850'>'They are typewritten,' I remarked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30851' title='30851'>'Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. </span>
<span sid='30852' title='30852'>Look at the neat little "Hosmer Angel" at the bottom. </span>
<span sid='30853' title='30853'> There is a but no superscription, except <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Leadenhall Street&t=h'>Leadenhall Street</a>, which is rather vague. </span>
<span sid='30854' title='30854'>The point about the signature very suggestive - in fact, we may call it conclusive.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30855' title='30855'>'Of what ?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30856' title='30856'>'My dear fellow, is it possible you do not sec how strongly it bears upon the case?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30857' title='30857'>I cannot say that I do, unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30858' title='30858'>'No, that was not the point. </span>
<span sid='30859' title='30859'>However, I shall write two letters which should settle the matter. </span>
<span sid='30860' title='30860'>One is to a firm in the City, the other is to the young lady's step-father, Mr Windibank, asking him whether he could meet us here at six o'clock to-morrow evening. </span>
<span sid='30861' title='30861'>It is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives. </span>
<span sid='30862' title='30862'>And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30863' title='30863'>I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle powers of reasoning, and extraordinary energy in action, that I felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom. </span>
<span sid='30864' title='30864'>Only once had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bohemia&t=h'>Bohemia</a> and of the Irene Adler photograph, but when I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30865' title='30865'>I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity  of the disappearing bride-groom of Miss Mary Sutherland.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30866' title='30866'>A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. </span>
<span sid='30867' title='30867'>It was not until close upon six o'clock that I found myself free, and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>, half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the dénouement of the little mystery. </span>
<span sid='30868' title='30868'>I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. </span>
<span sid='30869' title='30869'>A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30870' title='30870'>'Well, have you solved it?' I asked as I entered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30871' title='30871'>'Yes. </span>
<span sid='30872' title='30872'>It was the bisulphate of baryta.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30873' title='30873'>'No, no, the mystery!' I cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30874' title='30874'>'Oh, that! </span>
<span sid='30875' title='30875'>I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. </span>
<span sid='30876' title='30876'>There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the details are of interest. </span>
<span sid='30877' title='30877'>The only drawback is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30878' title='30878'>'Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30879' title='30879'>The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and a tap at the door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30880' title='30880'>'This is the girl's step-father, Mr James Windibank,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='30881' title='30881'>'He has written to me to say that he would be here at six. </span>
<span sid='30882' title='30882'>Come in!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30883' title='30883'>The man who entered was a sturdy middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of age, clean shaven, and sallow skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes. </span>
<span sid='30884' title='30884'>He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow, sidled down into the nearest chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30885' title='30885'>'Good evening, Mr James Windibank,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='30886' title='30886'>'I think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o'clock!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30887' title='30887'>'Yes, sir. </span>
<span sid='30888' title='30888'>I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own master, you know. </span>
<span sid='30889' title='30889'>I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of this sort in public. </span>
<span sid='30890' title='30890'>It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. </span>
<span sid='30891' title='30891'>Of course, I do not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. </span>
<span sid='30892' title='30892'>Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30893' title='30893'>'On the contrary,' said Holmes quietly; 'I have every reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr Hosmer Angel.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30894' title='30894'>Mr Windibank gave a violent start, and dropped his gloves.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30895' title='30895'>'I am delighted to hear it,' he said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30896' title='30896'>'It is a curious thing,' remarked Holmes, 'that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting. </span>
<span sid='30897' title='30897'>Unless they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. </span>
<span sid='30898' title='30898'>Some letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side. </span>
<span sid='30899' title='30899'>Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr Windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over of the "e", and a slight defect in the tail of the "r". </span>
<span sid='30900' title='30900'>There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more obvious.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30901' title='30901'>'We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt it is a little worn,' our visitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30902' title='30902'>'And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr Windibank,' Holmes continued. </span>
<span sid='30903' title='30903'>'I think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the type-writer and its relation to crime. </span>
<span sid='30904' title='30904'>It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. </span>
<span sid='30905' title='30905'>I have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. </span>
<span sid='30906' title='30906'>They are all typewritten. </span>
<span sid='30907' title='30907'>In each case, not only are the "e's" slurred, and the "r's" tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30908' title='30908'>Mr Windibank sprang out of his chair, and picked up his hat. </span>
<span sid='30909' title='30909'>'I cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr Holmes,' he said. </span>
<span sid='30910' title='30910'>'If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30911' title='30911'>'Certainly,' said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the door. </span>
<span sid='30912' title='30912'>'I let you know, then, that I have caught him!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30913' title='30913'>'What! where?' shouted Mr Windibank, turning white to his lips, and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30914' title='30914'>'Oh, it won't do - really it won't,' said Holmes, suavely. </span>
<span sid='30915' title='30915'>'There is no possible getting out of it, Mr Windibank. </span>
<span sid='30916' title='30916'>It is quite too transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. </span>
<span sid='30917' title='30917'>That's right! </span>
<span sid='30918' title='30918'>Sit down, and let us talk it over.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30919' title='30919'>Our visitor collapsed into a chair with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow. </span>
<span sid='30920' title='30920'>'It - it's not actionable,' he stammered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30921' title='30921'>'I am very much afraid that it is not. </span>
<span sid='30922' title='30922'>But between ourselves, Windibank, it was as cruel, and selfish, and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me. </span>
<span sid='30923' title='30923'>Now, let me just run over the course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30924' title='30924'>The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast, like one who is utterly crushed. </span>
<span sid='30925' title='30925'>Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece, and leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30926' title='30926'>'The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,' said he, 'and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them. </span>
<span sid='30927' title='30927'>It was a considerable sum for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. </span>
<span sid='30928' title='30928'>It was worth an effort to preserve it. </span>
<span sid='30929' title='30929'>The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. </span>
<span sid='30930' title='30930'>Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her step-father do to prevent it? </span>
<span sid='30931' title='30931'>He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home, and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age. </span>
<span sid='30932' title='30932'>But soon he found that that would not answer for ever. </span>
<span sid='30933' title='30933'>She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. </span>
<span sid='30934' title='30934'>What does her clever step-father do then? </span>
<span sid='30935' title='30935'>He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. </span>
<span sid='30936' title='30936'>With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl's short sight, he appears as Mr Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love himself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30937' title='30937'>'It was only a joke at first,' groaned our visitor. </span>
<span sid='30938' title='30938'>'We never thought that she would have been so carried away.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30939' title='30939'>'Very likely not. </span>
<span sid='30940' title='30940'>However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and having quite made up her mind that her step-father was in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. </span>
<span sid='30941' title='30941'>She was flattered by the gentleman's attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. </span>
<span sid='30942' title='30942'>Then Mr Angel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go, if a real effect were to be produced. </span>
<span sid='30943' title='30943'>There were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl's affections from turning towards anyone else. </span>
<span sid='30944' title='30944'>But the deception could not be kept up for ever. </span>
<span sid='30945' title='30945'>These pretended journeys to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a> were rather cumbrous. </span>
<span sid='30946' title='30946'>The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady's mind, and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come. </span>
<span sid='30947' title='30947'>Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding. </span>
<span sid='30948' title='30948'>James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man. </span>
<span sid='30949' title='30949'>As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no further, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler, and out at the other. </span>
<span sid='30950' title='30950'>I think that that was the chain of events, Mr Windibank!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30951' title='30951'>Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30952' title='30952'>'It may be so, or it may not, Mr Holmes,' said he, 'but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now, and not me. </span>
<span sid='30953' title='30953'>I have done nothing actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30954' title='30954'>'The law cannot, as you say, touch you,' said Holmes, unlocking and throwing open the door, 'yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more. </span>
<span sid='30955' title='30955'>If the young lady has a brother or a friend he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. </span>
<span sid='30956' title='30956'>By Jove!' he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man's face, 'it is not part of my duties to my client, but here's a hunting-crop handy, and I think I shall just treat myself to-' </span>
<span sid='30957' title='30957'>He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30958' title='30958'>'There's a cold-blooded scoundrel!' said Holmes, laughing, as he threw himself down into his chair once more. </span>
<span sid='30959' title='30959'>'That fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad and ends on a gallows. </span>
<span sid='30960' title='30960'>The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30961' title='30961'>'I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,' I remarked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30962' title='30962'>'Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the step-father. </span>
<span sid='30963' title='30963'>Then the fact that the two men were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. </span>
<span sid='30964' title='30964'>So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. </span>
<span sid='30965' title='30965'>My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature, which of course inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognize even the smallest sample of it. </span>
<span sid='30966' title='30966'>You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30967' title='30967'>'And how did you verify them?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30968' title='30968'>'Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. </span>
<span sid='30969' title='30969'>I knew the firm for which this man worked. </span>
<span sid='30970' title='30970'>Having taken the printed description, I eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise - the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered the description of any of their travellers. </span>
<span sid='30971' title='30971'>I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business address, asking him if he would come here. </span>
<span sid='30972' title='30972'>As I expected, his reply was typewritten, and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects. </span>
<span sid='30973' title='30973'>The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Fenchurch Street&t=h'>Fenchurch Street</a>, to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employee, James Windibank. </span>
<span sid='30974' title='30974'>Voila tout!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30975' title='30975'>'And Miss Sutherland?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30976' title='30976'>'If I tell her she will not believe me. </span>
<span sid='30977' title='30977'>You may remember the old <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Persia&t=h'>Persia</a>n saying, "There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman." </span>
<span sid='30978' title='30978'>There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world.'</span>
