<p>
<span sid='31986' title='31986'>1 THE SINGULAR EXPERIENCE OF MR JOHN SCOTT ECCLES</span>
<p>
<span sid='31987' title='31987'>I find it recorded in my notebook that it was a bleak and windy day towards the end of March in the year 1895. </span>
<span sid='31988' title='31988'>Holmes had received a telegram whilst we sat at our lunch, and he had scribbled a reply. </span>
<span sid='31989' title='31989'>He made no remark, but the matter remained in his thoughts, for he stood in front of the fire afterwards with a thoughtful face, smoking his pipe, and casting an occasional glance at the message. </span>
<span sid='31990' title='31990'>Suddenly he turned upon me with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31991' title='31991'>'I suppose, Watson, we must look upon you as a man of letters,' said he. </span>
<span sid='31992' title='31992'>'How do you define the word "grotesque"?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31993' title='31993'>'Strange - remarkable,' I suggested.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31994' title='31994'>He shook his head at my definition.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31995' title='31995'>'There is surely something more than that,' said he, 'some underlying suggestion of the tragic and the terrible. </span>
<span sid='31996' title='31996'>If you cast your mind back to some of those narratives with which you have afflicted a long-suffering public, you will recognize how often the grotesque has deepened into the criminal. </span>
<span sid='31997' title='31997'>Think of that little affair of the red-headed men. </span>
<span sid='31998' title='31998'>That was grotesque enough in the outset, and yet it ended in a desperate attempt at robbery. </span>
<span sid='31999' title='31999'>Or, again, there was that most grotesque affair of the five orange pips, which led straight to a murderous conspiracy. </span>
<span sid='32000' title='32000'>The word puts me on the alert.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32001' title='32001'>'Have you it there?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32002' title='32002'>He read the telegram aloud.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32003' title='32003'>'"Have just had most incredible and grotesque experience. </span>
<span sid='32004' title='32004'>May I consult you? - Scott Eccles, Post Office, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Charing Cross&t=h'>Charing Cross</a>."'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32005' title='32005'>'Man or woman?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32006' title='32006'>'Oh, man, of course. </span>
<span sid='32007' title='32007'>No woman would ever send a reply-paid telegram. </span>
<span sid='32008' title='32008'>She would have come.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32009' title='32009'>'Will you see him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32010' title='32010'>'My dear Watson, you know how bored I have been since we locked up Colonel Carruthers. </span>
<span sid='32011' title='32011'>My mind is like a racing engine, tearing itself to pieces because it is not connected up with the work for which it was built. </span>
<span sid='32012' title='32012'>Life is commonplace, the papers are sterile, audacity and romance seem to have passed for ever from the criminal world. </span>
<span sid='32013' title='32013'>Can you ask me, then, whether I am ready to look into any new problem, however trivial it may prove? </span>
<span sid='32014' title='32014'>But here, unless I am mistaken, is our client.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32015' title='32015'>A measured step was heard upon the stairs, and a moment later a stout, tall, grey-whiskered and solemnly respectable person was ushered into the room. </span>
<span sid='32016' title='32016'>His life history was written in his heavy features and pompous manner. </span>
<span sid='32017' title='32017'>From his spats to his gold-rimmed spectacles he was a Conservative, a Churchman, a good citizen, orthodox and conventional to the last degree. </span>
<span sid='32018' title='32018'>But some amazing experience had disturbed his native composure and left its traces in his bristling hair, his flushed, angry cheeks, and his flurried, excited manner. </span>
<span sid='32019' title='32019'>He plunged instantly into his business.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32020' title='32020'>'I have had a most singular and unpleasant experience, Mr Holmes,' said he. </span>
<span sid='32021' title='32021'>'Never in my life have I been placed in such a situation. </span>
<span sid='32022' title='32022'>It is most improper - most outrageous. </span>
<span sid='32023' title='32023'>I must insist upon some explanation.' </span>
<span sid='32024' title='32024'>He swelled and puffed in his anger.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32025' title='32025'>'Pray sit down, Mr Scott Eccles,' said Holmes, in a soothing voice. </span>
<span sid='32026' title='32026'>'May I ask, in the first place, why you came to me at all?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32027' title='32027'>'Well, sir, it did not appear to be a matter which concerned the police, and yet, when you have heard the facts, you must admit that I could not leave it where it was. </span>
<span sid='32028' title='32028'>Private detectives are a class with whom I have absolutely no sympathy, but none the less, having heard your name-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32029' title='32029'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='32030' title='32030'>But, in the second place, why did you not come at once?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32031' title='32031'>'What do you mean?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32032' title='32032'>Holmes glanced at his watch.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32033' title='32033'>'It is a quarter past two,' he said. </span>
<span sid='32034' title='32034'>'Your telegram was dispatched about one. </span>
<span sid='32035' title='32035'>But no one can glance at your toilet and attire without seeing that your disturbance dates from the moment of your waking.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32036' title='32036'>Our client smoothed down his unbrushed hair and felt his unshaven chin.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32037' title='32037'>'You are right, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='32038' title='32038'>I never gave a thought to my toilet. </span>
<span sid='32039' title='32039'>I was only too glad to get out of such a house. </span>
<span sid='32040' title='32040'>But I have been running round making inquiries before I came to you. </span>
<span sid='32041' title='32041'>I went to the house agents, you know, and they said Mr Garcia's rent was paid up all tight, and that everything was in order at Wisteria Lodge.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32042' title='32042'>'Come, come, sir,' said Holmes, laughing. </span>
<span sid='32043' title='32043'>'You are like my friend Dr Watson, who has a bad habit of telling his stories wrong end foremost. </span>
<span sid='32044' title='32044'>Please arrange your thoughts and let me know, in their due sequence, exactly what those events are which have sent you out unbrushed and unkempt, with dress boots and waistcoat buttoned awry, in search of advice and assistance.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32045' title='32045'>Our client looked down with a rueful face at his own unconventional appearance.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32046' title='32046'>'I'm sure it must look very bad, Mr Holmes, and I am not aware that in my whole life such a thing has ever happened before. </span>
<span sid='32047' title='32047'>But I will tell you the whole queer business, and when I have done so you will admit, I am sure, that there has been enough to excuse me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32048' title='32048'>But his narrative was nipped in the bud. </span>
<span sid='32049' title='32049'>There was a bustle outside, and Mrs Hudson opened the door to usher in two robust and official-looking individuals, one of whom was well known to us as Inspector Gregson of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>, an energetic, gallant, and, within his limitations, a capable officer. </span>
<span sid='32050' title='32050'>He shook hands with Holmes, and introduced his comrade as Inspector Baynes of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Surrey&t=h'>Surrey</a> Constabulary.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32051' title='32051'>'We are hunting together, Mr Holmes, and our trail lay in this direction.' </span>
<span sid='32052' title='32052'>He turned his bulldog eyes upon our visitor. </span>
<span sid='32053' title='32053'>'Are you Mr John Scott Eccles, of Popham House, Lee?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32054' title='32054'>'I am.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32055' title='32055'>'We have been following you about all the morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32056' title='32056'>'You traced him through the telegram, no doubt,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32057' title='32057'>'Exactly, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='32058' title='32058'>We picked up the scent at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Charing Cross&t=h'>Charing Cross</a> Post Office and came on here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32059' title='32059'>'But why do you follow me? </span>
<span sid='32060' title='32060'>What do you want?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32061' title='32061'>'We wish a statement, Mr Scott Eccles, as to the events which led up to the death last night of Mr Aloysius Garcia, of Wisteria lodge, near Esher.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32062' title='32062'>Our client had sat up with staring eyes and every tinge of colour struck from his astonished face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32063' title='32063'>'Dead? </span>
<span sid='32064' title='32064'>Did you say he was dead?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32065' title='32065'>'Yes, sir, he is dead.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32066' title='32066'>'But how? </span>
<span sid='32067' title='32067'>An accident?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32068' title='32068'>'Murder, if ever there was one upon earth.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32069' title='32069'>'Good God! </span>
<span sid='32070' title='32070'>This is awful! </span>
<span sid='32071' title='32071'>You don't mean - you don't mean that I am suspected?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32072' title='32072'>'A letter of yours was found in the dead man's pocket, and we know by it that you had planned to pass last night at his house.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32073' title='32073'>'So I did.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32074' title='32074'>'Oh, you did, did you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32075' title='32075'>Out came the official notebook.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32076' title='32076'>'Wait a bit, Gregson,' said Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='32077' title='32077'>'All you desire is a plain statement, is it not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32078' title='32078'>'And it is my duty to warn Mr Scott Eccles that it may be used against him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32079' title='32079'>'Mr Eccles was going to tell us about it when you entered the room. </span>
<span sid='32080' title='32080'>I think, Watson, a brandy and soda would do him no harm. </span>
<span sid='32081' title='32081'>Now, sir, I suggest that you take no notice of this addition to your audience, and that you proceed with your narrative exactly as you would have done had you never been interrupted.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32082' title='32082'>Our visitor had gulped off the brandy and the colour had returned to his face. </span>
<span sid='32083' title='32083'>With a dubious glance at the inspector's notebook, he plunged at once into his extraordinary statement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32084' title='32084'>'I am a bachelor,' said he, 'and, being of a sociable turn, I cultivate a large number of friends. </span>
<span sid='32085' title='32085'>Among these are the family of a retired brewer called Melville, living at Albemarle Mansion, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kensington&t=h'>Kensington</a>. </span>
<span sid='32086' title='32086'>It was at his table that I met some weeks ago a young fellow named Garcia. </span>
<span sid='32087' title='32087'>He was, I understood, of Spanish descent and connected in some way with the Embassy. </span>
<span sid='32088' title='32088'>He spoke perfect English, was pleasing in his manners, and as good-looking a man as ever I saw in my life.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32089' title='32089'>'In some way we struck up quite a friendship, this young fellow and I. </span>
<span sid='32090' title='32090'>He seemed to take a fancy to me from the first, and within two days of our meeting he came to see me at Lee. </span>
<span sid='32091' title='32091'>One thing led to another, and it ended in his inviting me out to spend a few days at his house, Wisteria Lodge, between Esher and Oxshott. </span>
<span sid='32092' title='32092'>Yesterday evening I went to Esher to fulfil this engagement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32093' title='32093'>'He had described his household to me before I went there. </span>
<span sid='32094' title='32094'>He lived with a faithful servant, a countryman of his own, who looked after all his needs. </span>
<span sid='32095' title='32095'>This fellow could speak English and did his housekeeping for him. </span>
<span sid='32096' title='32096'>Then there was a wonderful cook, he said, a half-breed whom he had picked up in his travels, who could serve an excellent dinner. </span>
<span sid='32097' title='32097'>I remember that he remarked what a queer household it was to find in the heart of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Surrey&t=h'>Surrey</a>, and that I agreed with him, though it has proved a good deal queerer than I thought.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32098' title='32098'>'I drove to the place - about two miles on the south side of Esher. </span>
<span sid='32099' title='32099'>The house was a fair-sized one, standing back from the road, with a curving drive which was banked with high evergreen shrubs. </span>
<span sid='32100' title='32100'>It was an old, tumbledown building in a crazy state of disrepair. </span>
<span sid='32101' title='32101'>When the trap pulled up on the grass-grown drive in front of the blotched and weather-stained door, I had doubts as to my wisdom in visiting a man whom I knew so slightly. </span>
<span sid='32102' title='32102'>He opened the door himself, however, and greeted me with a great show of cordiality. </span>
<span sid='32103' title='32103'>I was handed over to the man-servant, a melancholy, swarthy individual, who led the way, my bag in his hand, to my bedroom. </span>
<span sid='32104' title='32104'>The whole place was depressing. </span>
<span sid='32105' title='32105'>Our dinner was tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte, and though my host did his best to be entertaining, his thoughts seemed to continually wander, and he talked so vaguely and wildly that I could hardly understand him. </span>
<span sid='32106' title='32106'>He continually drummed his fingers on the table, gnawed his nails, and gave other signs of nervous impatience. </span>
<span sid='32107' title='32107'>The dinner itself was neither well served nor well cooked, and the gloomy presence of the taciturn servant did not help to enliven us. </span>
<span sid='32108' title='32108'>I can assure you that many times in the course of the evening I wished that I could invent some excuse which would take me back to Lee.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32109' title='32109'>'One thing comes back to my memory which may have a bearing upon the business that you two gentlemen are investigating. </span>
<span sid='32110' title='32110'>I thought nothing of it at the time. </span>
<span sid='32111' title='32111'>Near the end of dinner a note was handed in by the servant. </span>
<span sid='32112' title='32112'>I noticed that after my host had read it he seemed even more distrait and strange than before. </span>
<span sid='32113' title='32113'>He gave up all pretence at conversation and sat, smoking endless cigarettes, lost in his own thoughts, but he made no remark as to the contents. </span>
<span sid='32114' title='32114'>About eleven I was glad to go to bed. </span>
<span sid='32115' title='32115'>Some time later Garcia looked in at my door - the room was dark at the time-and asked me if I had rung. </span>
<span sid='32116' title='32116'>I said that I had not. </span>
<span sid='32117' title='32117'>He apologized for having disturbed me so late, saying that it was nearly one o'clock. </span>
<span sid='32118' title='32118'>I dropped off after this and slept soundly all night.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32119' title='32119'>'And now I come to the amazing part of my tale. </span>
<span sid='32120' title='32120'>When I woke it was broad daylight. </span>
<span sid='32121' title='32121'>I glanced at my watch, and the time was nearly nine. </span>
<span sid='32122' title='32122'>I had particularly asked to be called at eight, so I was very much astonished at this forgetfulness. </span>
<span sid='32123' title='32123'>I sprang up and rang for the servant. </span>
<span sid='32124' title='32124'>There was no response. </span>
<span sid='32125' title='32125'>I rang again and again, with the same result. </span>
<span sid='32126' title='32126'>Then I came to the conclusion that the bell was out of order. </span>
<span sid='32127' title='32127'>I huddled on my clothes and hurried downstairs in an exceedingly bad temper to order some hot water. </span>
<span sid='32128' title='32128'>You can imagine my surprise when I found that there was no one there. </span>
<span sid='32129' title='32129'>I shouted in the hall There was no answer. </span>
<span sid='32130' title='32130'>Then I ran from room to room. </span>
<span sid='32131' title='32131'>All were deserted. </span>
<span sid='32132' title='32132'>My host had shown me which was his bedroom the night before, so I knocked at the door. </span>
<span sid='32133' title='32133'>No reply. </span>
<span sid='32134' title='32134'>I turned the handle and walked in. </span>
<span sid='32135' title='32135'>The room was empty, and the bed had never been slept in. </span>
<span sid='32136' title='32136'>He had gone with the rest. </span>
<span sid='32137' title='32137'>The foreign host, the foreign footman, the foreign cook, all had vanished in the night! </span>
<span sid='32138' title='32138'>That was the end of my visit to Wisteria Lodge.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32139' title='32139'>Sherlock Holmes was rubbing his hands and chuckling as he added this bizarre incident to his collection of strange episodes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32140' title='32140'>'Your experience is, so far as I know, perfectly unique,' said he. </span>
<span sid='32141' title='32141'>'May I ask, sir, what you did then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32142' title='32142'>'I was furious. </span>
<span sid='32143' title='32143'>My first idea was that I had been the victim of some absurd practical joke. </span>
<span sid='32144' title='32144'>I packed my things, banged the hall door behind me, and set off for Esher, with my bag in my hand. </span>
<span sid='32145' title='32145'>I called at Allan Brothers', the chief land agents in the village, and found that it was from this firm that the villa had been rented. </span>
<span sid='32146' title='32146'>It struck me that the whole proceeding could hardly be for the purpose of making a fool of me, and that the main object must be to get out of the rent. </span>
<span sid='32147' title='32147'>It is late in March, so quarter-day is at hand. </span>
<span sid='32148' title='32148'>But this theory would not work. </span>
<span sid='32149' title='32149'>The agent was obliged to me for my warning, but told me that the rent had been paid in advance. </span>
<span sid='32150' title='32150'>Then I made my way to town and called at the Spanish Embassy. </span>
<span sid='32151' title='32151'>The man was unknown there. </span>
<span sid='32152' title='32152'>After this I went to see Melville, at whose house I had first met Garcia, but I found that he really knew rather less about him than I did. </span>
<span sid='32153' title='32153'>Finally, when I got your reply to my wire I came out to you, since I understand that you are a person who gives advice in difficult cases. </span>
<span sid='32154' title='32154'>But now, Mr Inspector, I gather, from what you said when you entered the room, that you can carry the story on, and that some tragedy has occurred. </span>
<span sid='32155' title='32155'>I can assure you that every word I have said is the truth, and that, outside of what I have told you, I know absolutely nothing about the fate of this man. </span>
<span sid='32156' title='32156'>My only desire is to help the law in every possible way.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32157' title='32157'>'I am sure of it, Mr Scott Eccles - I am sure of it,' said Inspector Gregson, in a very amiable tone. </span>
<span sid='32158' title='32158'>'I am bound to say that everything which you have said agrees very closely with the facts as they have come to our notice. </span>
<span sid='32159' title='32159'>For example, there was that note which arrived during dinner. </span>
<span sid='32160' title='32160'>Did you chance to observe what became of it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32161' title='32161'>'Yes, I did. </span>
<span sid='32162' title='32162'>Garcia rolled it up and threw it into the fire.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32163' title='32163'>'What do you say to that, Mr Baynes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32164' title='32164'>The country detective was a stout, puffy, red man, whose face was only redeemed from grossness by two extraordinarily bright eyes, almost hidden behind the heavy creases of cheek and brow. </span>
<span sid='32165' title='32165'>With a slow smile he drew a folded and discoloured scrap of paper from his pocket.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32166' title='32166'>'It was a dog-grate, Mr Holmes, and he over-pitched it. </span>
<span sid='32167' title='32167'>I picked this out unburned from the back of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32168' title='32168'>Holmes smiled his appreciation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32169' title='32169'>'You must have examined the house very carefully, to find a single pellet of paper.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32170' title='32170'>'I did, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='32171' title='32171'>It's my way. </span>
<span sid='32172' title='32172'>Shall I read it, Mr Gregson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32173' title='32173'>The <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>er nodded.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32174' title='32174'>'The note is written upon ordinary cream-laid paper without watermark. </span>
<span sid='32175' title='32175'>It is a quarter-sheet. </span>
<span sid='32176' title='32176'>The paper is cut off in two snips with a short-bladed scissors. </span>
<span sid='32177' title='32177'>It has been folded over three times and scaled with purple wax, put on hurriedly and pressed down with some flat, oval object. </span>
<span sid='32178' title='32178'>It is addressed to Mr Garcia, Wisteria Lodge. </span>
<span sid='32179' title='32179'>It says: </span>
<span sid='32180' title='32180'>"Our own colours, green and white. </span>
<span sid='32181' title='32181'>Green open, white shut. </span>
<span sid='32182' title='32182'>Main stair, first corridor, seventh right, green baize. </span>
<span sid='32183' title='32183'>God speed. D." </span>
<span sid='32184' title='32184'>It is a woman's writing, done with a sharp-pointed pen, but the address is either done with another pen or by someone else. </span>
<span sid='32185' title='32185'>It is thicker and bolder, as you see.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32186' title='32186'>'A very remarkable note,' said Holmes, glancing it over. </span>
<span sid='32187' title='32187'>'I must compliment you, Mr Baynes, upon your attention to detail in your examination of it. </span>
<span sid='32188' title='32188'>A few trifling points might perhaps be added. </span>
<span sid='32189' title='32189'>The oval seal is undoubtedly a plain sleeve-link - what else is of such a shape? </span>
<span sid='32190' title='32190'>The scissors were bent nail-scissors. </span>
<span sid='32191' title='32191'>Short as the two snips are, you can distinctly see the same slight curve in each.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32192' title='32192'>The country detective chuckled.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32193' title='32193'>'I thought I had squeezed all the juice out of it, but I see there was a little over,' he said. </span>
<span sid='32194' title='32194'>'I'm bound to say that I make nothing of the note except that there was something on hand, and that a woman, as usual, was at the bottom of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32195' title='32195'>Mr Scott Eccles had fidgeted in his seat during this conversation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32196' title='32196'>'I am glad you found the note, since it corroborates my story,' said he. </span>
<span sid='32197' title='32197'>'But I beg to point out that I have not yet heard what has happened to Mr Garcia, nor what has become of his household.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32198' title='32198'>'As to Garcia,' said Gregson, 'that is easily answered. </span>
<span sid='32199' title='32199'>He was found dead this morning upon Oxshott Common, nearly a mile from his home. </span>
<span sid='32200' title='32200'>His head had been smashed to pulp by heavy blows of a sand-bag or some such instrument, which had crushed rather than wounded. </span>
<span sid='32201' title='32201'>It is a lonely corner, and there is no house within a quarter of a mile of the spot. </span>
<span sid='32202' title='32202'>He had apparently been struck down first from behind, but his assailant had gone on beating him long after he was dead. </span>
<span sid='32203' title='32203'>It was a most furious assault. </span>
<span sid='32204' title='32204'>There are no footsteps nor any clue to the criminals.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32205' title='32205'>'Robbed?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32206' title='32206'>'No, there was no attempt at robbery.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32207' title='32207'>'This is very painful - very painful and terrible,' said Mr Scott Eccles, in a querulous voice, 'but it is really uncommonly hard upon me. </span>
<span sid='32208' title='32208'>I had nothing to do with my host going off upon a nocturnal excursion and meeting so sad an end. </span>
<span sid='32209' title='32209'>How do I come to be mixed up with the case?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32210' title='32210'>'Very simply, sir,' Inspector Baynes answered. </span>
<span sid='32211' title='32211'>'The only document found in the pocket of the deceased was a letter from you saying that you would be with him on the night of his death. </span>
<span sid='32212' title='32212'>It was the envelope of this letter which gave us the dead man's name and address. </span>
<span sid='32213' title='32213'>It was after nine this morning when we reached his house and found neither you nor anyone else inside it. </span>
<span sid='32214' title='32214'>I wired to Mr Gregson to run you down in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> while I examined Wisteria Lodge. </span>
<span sid='32215' title='32215'>Then I came into town, joined Mr Gregson, and here we are.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32216' title='32216'>'I think now,' said Gregson, rising, 'we had best put this matter into an official shape. </span>
<span sid='32217' title='32217'>You will come round with us to the station, Mr Scott Eccles, and let us have your statement in writing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32218' title='32218'>'Certainly, I will come at once. </span>
<span sid='32219' title='32219'>But I retain your services, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='32220' title='32220'>I desire you to spare no expense and no pains to get at the truth.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32221' title='32221'>My friend turned to the country inspector.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32222' title='32222'>'I suppose that you have no objection to my collaborating with you, Mr Baynes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32223' title='32223'>'Highly honoured, sir, I am sure.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32224' title='32224'>'You appear to have been very prompt and businesslike in all that you have done. </span>
<span sid='32225' title='32225'>Was there any clue, may I ask, as to the exact hour that the man met his death?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32226' title='32226'>'He had been there since one o'clock. </span>
<span sid='32227' title='32227'>There was rain about that time, and his death had certainly been before the rain.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32228' title='32228'>'But that is perfectly impossible, Mr Baynes,' cried our client. </span>
<span sid='32229' title='32229'>'His voice is unmistakable. </span>
<span sid='32230' title='32230'>I could swear to it that it was he who addressed me in my bedroom at that very hour.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32231' title='32231'>'Remarkable, but by no means impossible,' said Holmes, smiling.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32232' title='32232'>'You have a clue?' asked Gregson.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32233' title='32233'>'On the face of it the case is not a very complex one, though it certainly presents some novel and interesting features. </span>
<span sid='32234' title='32234'>A further knowledge of facts is necessary before I would venture to give a final and definite opinion. </span>
<span sid='32235' title='32235'>By the way, Mr Baynes, did you find anything remarkable besides this note in your examination of the house?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32236' title='32236'>The detective looked at my friend in a singular way.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32237' title='32237'>'There were,' said he, 'one or two very remarkable things. </span>
<span sid='32238' title='32238'>Perhaps when I have finished at the police-station you would care to come out and give me your opinion of them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32239' title='32239'>'I am entirely at your service,' said Sherlock Holmes, ringing the bell. </span>
<span sid='32240' title='32240'>'You will show these gentlemen out, Mrs Hudson, and kindly send the boy with this telegram. </span>
<span sid='32241' title='32241'>He is to pay a five-shilling reply.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32242' title='32242'>We sat for some time in silence after our visitors had left. </span>
<span sid='32243' title='32243'>Holmes smoked hard, with his brows drawn down over his keen eyes, and his head thrust forward in the eager way characteristic of the man.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32244' title='32244'>'Well, Watson,' he asked, turning suddenly upon me, 'what do you make of it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32245' title='32245'>'I can make nothing of this mystification of Scott Eccles.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32246' title='32246'>'But the crime?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32247' title='32247'>'Well, taken with the disappearance of the man's companions, I should say that they were in some way concerned in the murder and had fled from justice.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32248' title='32248'>'That is certainly a possible point of view. </span>
<span sid='32249' title='32249'>On the face of it you must admit, however, that it is very strange that his two servants should have been in a conspiracy against him and should have attacked him on the one night when he had a guest. </span>
<span sid='32250' title='32250'>They had him alone at their mercy every other night in the week.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32251' title='32251'>'Then why did they fly?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32252' title='32252'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='32253' title='32253'>Why did they fly? </span>
<span sid='32254' title='32254'>There is a big fact. </span>
<span sid='32255' title='32255'>Another big fact is the remarkable experience of our client, Scott Eccles. </span>
<span sid='32256' title='32256'>Now, my dear Watson, is it beyond the limits of human ingenuity to furnish an explanation which would cover both these big facts? </span>
<span sid='32257' title='32257'>If it were one which would also admit of the mysterious note with its very curious phraseology, why, then it would be worth accepting as a temporary hypothesis. </span>
<span sid='32258' title='32258'>If the fresh facts which come to our knowledge all fit themselves into the scheme, then our hypothesis may gradually become a solution.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32259' title='32259'>'But what is our hypothesis?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32260' title='32260'>Holmes leaned back in his chair with half-closed eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32261' title='32261'>'You must admit, my dear Watson, that the idea of a joke is impossible. </span>
<span sid='32262' title='32262'>There were grave events afoot, as the sequel showed, and the coaxing of Scott Eccles to Wisteria Lodge had some connection with them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32263' title='32263'>'But what possible connection?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32264' title='32264'>'Let us take it link by link. </span>
<span sid='32265' title='32265'>There is, on the face of it, something unnatural about this strange and sudden friendship between the young Spaniard and Scott Eccles. </span>
<span sid='32266' title='32266'>It was the former who forced the pace. </span>
<span sid='32267' title='32267'>He called upon Eccles at the other end of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> on the very day after he first met him, and he kept in close touch with him until he got him down to Esher. </span>
<span sid='32268' title='32268'>Now, what did he want with Eccles? </span>
<span sid='32269' title='32269'>What could Eccles supply? </span>
<span sid='32270' title='32270'>I see no charm in the man. </span>
<span sid='32271' title='32271'>He is not particularly intelligent - not a man likely to be congenial to a quick-witted Latin. </span>
<span sid='32272' title='32272'>Why, then, was he picked out from all the other people whom Garcia met as particularly suited to his purpose? </span>
<span sid='32273' title='32273'>Has he any one outstanding quality? </span>
<span sid='32274' title='32274'>I say that he has. </span>
<span sid='32275' title='32275'>He is the very type of conventional British respectability, and the very man as a witness to impress another Briton. </span>
<span sid='32276' title='32276'>You saw yourself how neither of the inspectors dreamed of questioning his statement, extraordinary as it was.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32277' title='32277'>'But what was he to witness?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32278' title='32278'>'Nothing, as things turned out, but everything had they gone another way. </span>
<span sid='32279' title='32279'>That is how I read the matter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32280' title='32280'>'I see, he might have proved an alibi.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32281' title='32281'>'Exactly, my dear Watson, he might have proved an alibi. </span>
<span sid='32282' title='32282'>We will suppose, for argument's sake, that the household of Wisteria Lodge are confederates in some design. </span>
<span sid='32283' title='32283'>The attempt, whatever it may be, is to come off, we will say, before one o'clock. </span>
<span sid='32284' title='32284'>By some juggling of the clocks it is quite possible that they may have got Scott Eccles to bed earlier than he thought, but in any case it is likely that when Garcia went out of his way to tell him that it was one it was really not more than twelve. </span>
<span sid='32285' title='32285'>If Garcia could do whatever he had to do and be back by the hour mentioned he had evidently a powerful reply to any accusation. </span>
<span sid='32286' title='32286'>Here was this irreproachable Englishman ready to swear in any court of law that the accused was in his house all the time. </span>
<span sid='32287' title='32287'>It was an insurance against the worst.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32288' title='32288'>'Yes, yes, I see that. </span>
<span sid='32289' title='32289'>But how about the disappearance of the others?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32290' title='32290'>'I have not all my facts yet, but I do not think there are any insuperable difficulties. </span>
<span sid='32291' title='32291'>Still, it is an error to argue in front of your data. </span>
<span sid='32292' title='32292'>You find yourself insensibly twisting them round to fit your theories.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32293' title='32293'>'And the message?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32294' title='32294'>'How did it run? </span>
<span sid='32295' title='32295'>"Our own colours, green and white." </span>
<span sid='32296' title='32296'>Sounds like racing. </span>
<span sid='32297' title='32297'>"Green open, white shut." </span>
<span sid='32298' title='32298'>That is clearly a signal. </span>
<span sid='32299' title='32299'>"Main stair, first corridor, seventh right, green baize." </span>
<span sid='32300' title='32300'>This is an assignation. </span>
<span sid='32301' title='32301'>We may find a jealous husband at the bottom of it all. </span>
<span sid='32302' title='32302'>It was clearly a dangerous quest. </span>
<span sid='32303' title='32303'>She could not have said "God speed" had it not been so. </span>
<span sid='32304' title='32304'>"D" - that should be a guide.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32305' title='32305'>'The man was a Spaniard. </span>
<span sid='32306' title='32306'>I suggest that "D" stands for Dolores, a common female name in Spain.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32307' title='32307'>'Good, Watson, very good - but quite inadmissible. </span>
<span sid='32308' title='32308'>A Spaniard would write to a Spaniard in Spanish. </span>
<span sid='32309' title='32309'>The writer of this note is certainly English. </span>
<span sid='32310' title='32310'>Well, we can only possess our souls in patience, until this excellent inspector comes back for us. </span>
<span sid='32311' title='32311'>Meanwhile we can thank our lucky fate which has rescued us for a few short hours from the insufferable fatigues of idleness.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32312' title='32312'>An answer had arrived to Holmes's telegram before our <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Surrey&t=h'>Surrey</a> officer had returned. </span>
<span sid='32313' title='32313'>Holmes read it, and was about to place it in his note-book when he caught a glimpse of my expectant face. </span>
<span sid='32314' title='32314'>He tossed it across with a laugh.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32315' title='32315'>'We are moving in exalted circles,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32316' title='32316'>The telegram was a list of names and addresses: </span>
<span sid='32317' title='32317'>'Lord Harringby, The Dingle, Sir George Ffolliott, Oxshott Towers, Mr Hynes Hynes, JP, Purdey Place, Mr James Baker Williams, Forton Old Hall, Mr Henderson, High Gable, Rev. Joshua Stone, Nether Walsling.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32318' title='32318'>'This is a very obvious way of limiting our field of operations,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='32319' title='32319'>'No doubt Baynes, with his methodical mind, has already adopted some similar plan.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32320' title='32320'>'I don't quite understand.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32321' title='32321'>'Well, my dear fellow, we have already arrived at the conclusion that the message received by Garcia at dinner was an appointment or an assignation. </span>
<span sid='32322' title='32322'>Now, if the obvious reading of it is correct, and in order to keep this tryst one has to ascend a main stair and seek the seventh door in a corridor, it is perfectly clear that the house is a very large one. </span>
<span sid='32323' title='32323'>It is equally certain that this house cannot be more than a mile or two from Oxshott, since Garcia was walking in that direction, and hoped, according to my reading of the facts, to be back again in Wisteria Lodge in time to avail himself of an alibi, which would only be valid up to one o'clock. </span>
<span sid='32324' title='32324'>As the number of large houses close to Oxshott must be limited, I adopted the obvious method of sending to the agents mentioned by Scott Eccles and obtaining a list of them. </span>
<span sid='32325' title='32325'>Here they are in this telegram, and the other end of our tangled skein must lie among them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32326' title='32326'>It was nearly six o'clock before we found ourselves in the pretty <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Surrey&t=h'>Surrey</a> village of Esher, with Inspector Baynes as our companion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32327' title='32327'>Holmes and I had taken things for the night, and found comfortable quarters at the Bull. </span>
<span sid='32328' title='32328'>Finally we set out in the company of the detective on our visit to Wisteria Lodge. </span>
<span sid='32329' title='32329'>It was a cold, dark March evening, with a sharp wind and a fine rain beating upon our faces, a fit setting for the wild common over which our road passed and the tragic goal to which it led us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32330' title='32330'>2 THE TIGER OF SAN PEDRO</span>
<p>
<span sid='32331' title='32331'>A cold and melancholy walk of a couple of miles brought us to a high wooden gate, which opened into a gloomy avenue of chestnuts. </span>
<span sid='32332' title='32332'>The curved and shadowed drive led us to a low, dark house, pitch-black against a slate-coloured sky. </span>
<span sid='32333' title='32333'>From the front window upon the left of the door there peeped a glimmer of a feeble light.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32334' title='32334'>'There's a constable in possession,' said Baynes. </span>
<span sid='32335' title='32335'>'I'll knock at the window.' </span>
<span sid='32336' title='32336'>He stepped across the grass plot and tapped with his hand on the pane. </span>
<span sid='32337' title='32337'>Through the fogged glass I dimly saw a man spring up from a chair beside the fire, and heard a sharp cry from within the room. </span>
<span sid='32338' title='32338'>An instant later a white-faced, hard-breathing policeman had opened the door, the candle wavering in his trembling hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32339' title='32339'>'What's the matter, Walters?' asked Baynes, sharply.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32340' title='32340'>The man mopped his forehead with his handkerchief and gave a long sigh of relief.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32341' title='32341'>'I am glad you have come, sir. </span>
<span sid='32342' title='32342'>It has been a long evening and I don't think my nerve is as good as it was.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32343' title='32343'>'Your nerve, Walters? </span>
<span sid='32344' title='32344'>I should not have thought you had a nerve in your body.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32345' title='32345'>'Well, sir, it's this lonely, silent house and the queer thing in the kitchen. </span>
<span sid='32346' title='32346'>Then when you tapped at the window I thought it had come again.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32347' title='32347'>'That what had come again?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32348' title='32348'>'The devil, sir, for all I know. </span>
<span sid='32349' title='32349'>It was at the window.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32350' title='32350'>'What was at the window, and when?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32351' title='32351'>'It was just about two hours ago. </span>
<span sid='32352' title='32352'>The light was just fading. </span>
<span sid='32353' title='32353'>I was sitting reading in the chair. </span>
<span sid='32354' title='32354'>I don't know what made me look up, but there was a face looking in at me through the lower pane. </span>
<span sid='32355' title='32355'>Lord, sir, what a face it was! </span>
<span sid='32356' title='32356'>I'll see it in my dreams.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32357' title='32357'>'Tut, tut, Walters! </span>
<span sid='32358' title='32358'>This is not talk for a police-constable.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32359' title='32359'>'I know, sir, I know, but it shook me, sir, and there's no use to deny it. </span>
<span sid='32360' title='32360'>It wasn't black, sir, nor was it white, nor any colour that I know, but a kind of queer shade like clay with a splash of milk in it. </span>
<span sid='32361' title='32361'>Then there was the size of it - it was twice yours, sir. </span>
<span sid='32362' title='32362'>And the look of it - the great staring goggle eyes, and the line of white teeth like a hungry beast. </span>
<span sid='32363' title='32363'>I tell you, sir, I couldn't move a finger, nor get my breath, till it whisked away and was gone. </span>
<span sid='32364' title='32364'>Out I ran and through the shrubbery, but thank God there was no one there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32365' title='32365'>'If I didn't know you were a good man, Walters, I should put a black mark against you for this. </span>
<span sid='32366' title='32366'>If it were the devil himself, a constable on duty should never thank God that he could not lay his hands upon him. </span>
<span sid='32367' title='32367'>I suppose the whole thing is not a vision and a touch of nerves?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32368' title='32368'>'That, at least, is very easily settled,' said Holmes, lighting his little pocket lantern. </span>
<span sid='32369' title='32369'>'Yes,' he reported, after a short examination of the grass bed, 'a number twelve shoe, I should say. </span>
<span sid='32370' title='32370'>If he was all on the same scale as his foot he must certainly have been a giant.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32371' title='32371'>'What became of him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32372' title='32372'>'He seems to have broken through the shrubbery and made for the road.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32373' title='32373'>'Well,' said the inspector, with a grave and thoughtful face, 'whoever he may have been, and whatever he may have wanted, he's gone for the present, and we have more immediate things to attend to. </span>
<span sid='32374' title='32374'>Now, Mr Holmes, with your permission, I will show you round the house.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32375' title='32375'>The various bedrooms and sitting-rooms had yielded nothing to a careful search. </span>
<span sid='32376' title='32376'>Apparently the tenants had brought little or nothing with them, and all the furniture down to the smallest details had been taken over with the house. </span>
<span sid='32377' title='32377'>A good deal of clothing with the stamp of Marx and Co., High <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Holborn&t=h'>Holborn</a>, had been left behind. </span>
<span sid='32378' title='32378'>Telegraphic inquiries had been already made which showed that Marx knew nothing of his customer save that he was a good payer. </span>
<span sid='32379' title='32379'>Odds and ends, some pipes, a few novels, two of them in Spanish, an old-fashioned pin-fire revolver, and a guitar were amongst the personal property.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32380' title='32380'>'Nothing in all this,' said Baynes, stalking, candle in hand, from room to room. </span>
<span sid='32381' title='32381'>'But now, Mr Holmes, I invite your attention to the kitchen.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32382' title='32382'>It was a gloomy, high-ceilinged room at the back of the house, with a straw litter in one corner, which served apparently as a bed for the cook. </span>
<span sid='32383' title='32383'>The table was piled with half-eaten dishes and dirty plates, the dÃ©bris of last night's dinner.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32384' title='32384'>'Look at this,' said Baynes. </span>
<span sid='32385' title='32385'>'What do you make of it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32386' title='32386'>He held up his candle before an extraordinary object which stood at the back of the dresser. </span>
<span sid='32387' title='32387'>It was so wrinkled and shrunken and withered that it was difficult to say what it might have been. </span>
<span sid='32388' title='32388'>One could but say that it was black and leathery and that it bore some resemblance to a dwarfish human figure. </span>
<span sid='32389' title='32389'>At first, as I examined it, I thought that it was a mummified negro baby, and then it seemed a very twisted and ancient monkey. </span>
<span sid='32390' title='32390'>Finally I was left in doubt as to whether it was animal or human. </span>
<span sid='32391' title='32391'>A double band of white shells was strung round the centre of it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32392' title='32392'>'Very interesting - very interesting, indeed!' said Holmes, peering at this sinister relic. </span>
<span sid='32393' title='32393'>'Anything more?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32394' title='32394'>In silence Baynes led the way to the sink and held forward his candle. </span>
<span sid='32395' title='32395'>The limbs and body of some large, white bird, torn savagely to pieces with the feathers still on, were littered all over it. </span>
<span sid='32396' title='32396'>Holmes pointed to the wattles on the severed head.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32397' title='32397'>'A white cock,' said he, 'most interesting! </span>
<span sid='32398' title='32398'>It is really a very curious case.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32399' title='32399'>But Mr Baynes had kept his most sinister exhibit to the last. </span>
<span sid='32400' title='32400'>From under the sink he drew a zinc pail which contained a quantity of blood. </span>
<span sid='32401' title='32401'>Then from the table he took a platter heaped with small pieces of charred bone.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32402' title='32402'>'Something has been killed and something has been burned. </span>
<span sid='32403' title='32403'>We raked all these out of the fire. </span>
<span sid='32404' title='32404'>We had a doctor in this morning. </span>
<span sid='32405' title='32405'>He says that they are not human.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32406' title='32406'>Holmes smiled and rubbed his hands.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32407' title='32407'>'I must congratulate you, inspector, on handling so distinctive and instructive a case. </span>
<span sid='32408' title='32408'>Your powers, if I may say so without offence, seem superior to your opportunities.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32409' title='32409'>Inspector Baynes's small eyes twinkled with pleasure.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32410' title='32410'>'You're right, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='32411' title='32411'>We stagnate in the provinces. </span>
<span sid='32412' title='32412'>A case of this sort gives a man a chance, and I hope that I shall take it. </span>
<span sid='32413' title='32413'>What do you make of these bones?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32414' title='32414'>'A lamb, I should say, or a kid.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32415' title='32415'>'And the white cock?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32416' title='32416'>'Curious, Mr Baynes, very curious. </span>
<span sid='32417' title='32417'>I should say almost unique.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32418' title='32418'>'Yes, sir, there must have been some very strange people with some very strange ways in this house. </span>
<span sid='32419' title='32419'>One of them is dead. </span>
<span sid='32420' title='32420'>Did his companions follow him and kill him? </span>
<span sid='32421' title='32421'>If they did we should have them, for every port is watched. </span>
<span sid='32422' title='32422'>But my own views are different. </span>
<span sid='32423' title='32423'>Yes, sir, my own views are very different.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32424' title='32424'>'You have a theory, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32425' title='32425'>'And I'll work it myself, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='32426' title='32426'>It's only due to my own credit to do so. </span>
<span sid='32427' title='32427'>Your name is made, but I have still to make mine. </span>
<span sid='32428' title='32428'>I should be glad to be able to say afterwards that I had solved it without your help.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32429' title='32429'>Holmes laughed good-humouredly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32430' title='32430'>'Well, well, inspector,' said he. </span>
<span sid='32431' title='32431'>'Do you follow your path and I will follow mine. </span>
<span sid='32432' title='32432'>My results are always very much at your service if you care to apply to me for them. </span>
<span sid='32433' title='32433'>I think that I have seen all that I wish in this house, and that my time may be more profitably employed elsewhere. </span>
<span sid='32434' title='32434'>Au revoir and good luck!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32435' title='32435'>I could tell by numerous subtle signs, which might have been lost upon anyone but myself, that Holmes was on a hot scent. </span>
<span sid='32436' title='32436'>As impassive as ever to the casual observer, there were none the less a subdued eagerness and suggestion of tension in his brightened eyes and brisker manner which assured me that the game was afoot. </span>
<span sid='32437' title='32437'>After his habit he said nothing, and after mine I asked no questions. </span>
<span sid='32438' title='32438'>Sufficient for me to share the sport and lend my humble help to the capture without distracting that intent brain with needless interruption. </span>
<span sid='32439' title='32439'>All would come round to me in due time.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32440' title='32440'>I waited, therefore - but, to my ever-deepening disappointment, I waited in vain. </span>
<span sid='32441' title='32441'>Day succeeded day, and my friend took no step forward. </span>
<span sid='32442' title='32442'>One morning he spent in town, and I learned from a casual reference that he had visited <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the British Museum&t=h'>the British Museum</a>. </span>
<span sid='32443' title='32443'>Save for this one excursion, he spent his days in long and often solitary walks, or in chatting with a number of village gossips whose acquaintance he had cultivated.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32444' title='32444'>'I'm sure, Watson, a week in the country will be invaluable to you,' he remarked. </span>
<span sid='32445' title='32445'>'It is very pleasant to see the first green shoots upon the hedges and the catkins on the hazels once again. </span>
<span sid='32446' title='32446'>With a spud, a tin box, and an elementary book on botany, there are instructive days to be spent.' </span>
<span sid='32447' title='32447'>He prowled about with this equipment himself, but it was a poor show of plants which he would bring back of an evening.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32448' title='32448'>Occasionally in our rambles we came across Inspector Baynes. </span>
<span sid='32449' title='32449'>His fat, red face wreathed itself in smiles and his small eyes glittered as he greeted my companion. </span>
<span sid='32450' title='32450'>He said little about the case, but from that little we gathered that he also was not dissatisfied at the course of events. </span>
<span sid='32451' title='32451'>I must admit, however, that I was somewhat surprised when, some five days after the crime, I opened my morning paper to find in large letters:</span>
<p>
<span sid='32452' title='32452'>THE OXSHOTT MYSTERY A SOLUTION ARREST OF SUPPOSED ASSASSIN</span>
<p>
<span sid='32453' title='32453'>Holmes sprang in his chair as if he had been stung when I read the head-lines.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32454' title='32454'>'By Jove!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='32455' title='32455'>'You don't mean that Baynes has got him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32456' title='32456'>'Apparently,' said I, as I read the following report:</span>
<p>
<span sid='32457' title='32457'>Great excitement was caused in Esher and the neighbouring district when it was learned late last night that an arrest had been effected in connection with the Oxshott murder. </span>
<span sid='32458' title='32458'>It will be remembered that Mr Garcia, of Wisteria Lodge, was found dead on Oxshott Common, his body showing signs of extreme violence, and that on the same night his servant and his cook fled, which appeared to show their participation in the crime. </span>
<span sid='32459' title='32459'>It was suggested, but never proved, that the deceased gentleman may have had valuables in the house, and that their abstraction was the motive of the crime. </span>
<span sid='32460' title='32460'>Every effort was made by Inspector Baynes, who has the case in hand, to ascertain the hiding place of the fugitives, and he had good reason to believe that they had not gone far, but were lurking in some retreat which had been already prepared. </span>
<span sid='32461' title='32461'>It was certain from the first, however, that they would eventually be detected, as the cook, from the evidence of one or two tradespeople who have caught a glimpse of him through the window, was a man of most remarkable appearance - being a huge and hideous mulatto, with yellowish features of a pronounced negroid type. </span>
<span sid='32462' title='32462'>This man has been seen since the crime, for he was detected and pursued by Constable Walters on the same evening, when he had the audacity to revisit Wisteria Lodge. </span>
<span sid='32463' title='32463'>Inspector Baynes, considering that such a visit must have some purpose in view, and was likely, therefore, to be repeated, abandoned the house, but left an ambuscade in the shrubbery. </span>
<span sid='32464' title='32464'>The man walked into the trap, and was captured last night after a struggle, in which Constable Downing was badly bitten by the savage. </span>
<span sid='32465' title='32465'>We understand that when the prisoner is brought before the magistrates a remand will be applied for by the police, and that great developments are hoped from his capture.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32466' title='32466'>'Really we must see Baynes at once,' cried Holmes, picking up his hat. </span>
<span sid='32467' title='32467'>'We will just catch him before he starts.' </span>
<span sid='32468' title='32468'>We hurried down the village street and found, as we had expected, that the inspector was just leaving his lodgings.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32469' title='32469'>'You've seen the paper, Mr Holmes?' he asked, holding one out to us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32470' title='32470'>'Yes, Baynes, I've seen it. </span>
<span sid='32471' title='32471'>Pray don't think it a liberty if I give you a word of friendly warning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32472' title='32472'>'Of warning, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32473' title='32473'>'I have looked into this case with some care, and I am not convinced that you are on the right lines. </span>
<span sid='32474' title='32474'>I don't want you to commit yourself too far, unless you are sure.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32475' title='32475'>'You're very kind, Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32476' title='32476'>'I assure you I speak for your good.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32477' title='32477'>It seemed to me that something like a wink quivered for an instant over one of Mr Baynes's tiny eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32478' title='32478'>'We agreed to work on our own lines, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='32479' title='32479'>That's what I am doing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32480' title='32480'>'Oh, very good,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='32481' title='32481'>'Don't blame me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32482' title='32482'>'No, sir, I believe you mean well by me. </span>
<span sid='32483' title='32483'>But we all have our own systems, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='32484' title='32484'>You have yours, and maybe I have mine.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32485' title='32485'>'Let us say no more about it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32486' title='32486'>'You're welcome always to my news. </span>
<span sid='32487' title='32487'>This fellow is a perfect savage, as strong as a carthorse and as fierce as the devil. </span>
<span sid='32488' title='32488'>He chewed Downing's thumb nearly off before they could master him. </span>
<span sid='32489' title='32489'>He hardly speaks a word of English, and we can get nothing out of him but grunts.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32490' title='32490'>'And you think you have evidence that he murdered his late master?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32491' title='32491'>'I didn't say so, Mr Holmes, I didn't say so. </span>
<span sid='32492' title='32492'>We all have our little ways. </span>
<span sid='32493' title='32493'>You try yours and I will try mine. </span>
<span sid='32494' title='32494'>That's the agreement.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32495' title='32495'>Holmes shrugged his shoulders as we walked away together. </span>
<span sid='32496' title='32496'>'I can't make the man out. </span>
<span sid='32497' title='32497'>He seems to be riding for a fall. </span>
<span sid='32498' title='32498'>Well, as he says, we must each try our own way and see what comes of it. </span>
<span sid='32499' title='32499'>But there's something in Inspector Baynes which I can't quite understand.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32500' title='32500'>'Just sit down in that chair, Watson,' said Sherlock Holmes, when we had returned to our apartment at the Bull. </span>
<span sid='32501' title='32501'>'I want to put you in touch with the situation, as I may need your help to-night. </span>
<span sid='32502' title='32502'>Let me show you the evolution of this case, so far as I have been able to follow it. </span>
<span sid='32503' title='32503'>Simple as it has been in its leading features, it has none the less presented surprising difficulties in the way of an arrest. </span>
<span sid='32504' title='32504'>There are gaps in that direction which we have still to fill.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32505' title='32505'>'We will go back to the note which was handed in to Garcia upon the evening of his death. </span>
<span sid='32506' title='32506'>We may put aside this idea of Baynes's that Garcia's servants were concerned in the matter. </span>
<span sid='32507' title='32507'>The proof of this lies in the fact that it was he who had arranged for the presence of Scott Eccles, which could only have been done for the purpose of an alibi. </span>
<span sid='32508' title='32508'>It was Garcia, then, who had an enterprise, and apparently a criminal enterprise, in hand that night, in the course of which he met his death. </span>
<span sid='32509' title='32509'>I say criminal because only a man with a criminal enterprise desires to establish an alibi. </span>
<span sid='32510' title='32510'>Who, then, is most likely to have taken his life? </span>
<span sid='32511' title='32511'>Surely the person against whom the criminal enterprise was directed. </span>
<span sid='32512' title='32512'>So far it seems to me that we are on safe ground.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32513' title='32513'>'We can now see a reason for the disappearance of Garcia's household. </span>
<span sid='32514' title='32514'>They were all confederates in the same unknown crime. </span>
<span sid='32515' title='32515'>If it came off then Garcia returned, any possible suspicion would be warded off by the Englishman's evidence, and all would be well. </span>
<span sid='32516' title='32516'>But the attempt was a dangerous one, and if Garcia did not return by a certain hour it was probable that his own life had been sacrificed. </span>
<span sid='32517' title='32517'>It had been arranged, therefore, that in such a case his two subordinates were to make for some prearranged spot, where they could escape investigation and be in a position afterwards to renew their attempt. </span>
<span sid='32518' title='32518'>That would fully explain the facts, would it not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32519' title='32519'>The whole inexplicable tangle seemed to straighten out before me. </span>
<span sid='32520' title='32520'>I wondered, as I always did, how it had not been obvious to me before.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32521' title='32521'>'But why should one servant return?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32522' title='32522'>'We can imagine that, in the confusion of flight, something precious, something which he could not bear to part with, had been left behind. </span>
<span sid='32523' title='32523'>That would explain his persistence, would it not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32524' title='32524'>'Well, what is the next step?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32525' title='32525'>'The next step is the note received by Garcia at the dinner. </span>
<span sid='32526' title='32526'>It indicates a confederate at the other end. </span>
<span sid='32527' title='32527'>Now, where was the other end? </span>
<span sid='32528' title='32528'>I have already shown you that it could only he in some large house, and that the number of large houses is limited. </span>
<span sid='32529' title='32529'>My first days in this village were devoted to a series of walks, in which in the intervals of my botanical researches I made a reconnaissance of all the large houses and an examination of the family history of the occupants. </span>
<span sid='32530' title='32530'>One house, and only one, riveted my attention. </span>
<span sid='32531' title='32531'>It is the famous old Jacobean grange of High Gable, one mile on the farther side of Oxshott, and less than half a mile from the scene of the tragedy. </span>
<span sid='32532' title='32532'>The other mansions belonged to prosaic and respectable people who live far aloof from romance. </span>
<span sid='32533' title='32533'>But Mr Henderson, of High Gable, was by all accounts a curious man, to whom curious adventures might befall. </span>
<span sid='32534' title='32534'>I concentrated my attention, therefore, upon him and his household.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32535' title='32535'>'A singular set of people, Watson - the man himself the most singular of them all. </span>
<span sid='32536' title='32536'>I managed to see him on a plausible pretext, but I seemed to read in his dark, deep-set, brooding eyes that he was perfectly aware of my true business. </span>
<span sid='32537' title='32537'>He is a man of fifty, strong, active, with iron-grey hair, great bunched black eyebrows, the step of a deer, and the air of an emperor - a fierce, masterful man, with a red-hot spirit behind his parchment face. </span>
<span sid='32538' title='32538'>He is either a foreigner or has lived long in the Tropics, for he is yellow and sapless, but tough as whipcord. </span>
<span sid='32539' title='32539'>His friend and secretary, Mr Lucas, is undoubtedly a foreigner, chocolate brown, wily, suave and cat-like, with a poisonous gentleness of speech. </span>
<span sid='32540' title='32540'>You see, Watson, we have come already upon two sets of foreigners - one at Wisteria Lodge and one at High Gable - so our gaps are beginning to close.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32541' title='32541'>'These two men, close and confidential friends, are the centre of the household, but there is one other person, who for our immediate purpose may be even more important. </span>
<span sid='32542' title='32542'>Henderson has two children - girls of eleven and thirteen. </span>
<span sid='32543' title='32543'>Their governess is a Miss Burnet, an Englishwoman of forty or thereabouts. </span>
<span sid='32544' title='32544'>There is also one confidential man-servant. </span>
<span sid='32545' title='32545'>This little group forms the real family, for they travel about together, and Henderson is a great traveller, always on the move. </span>
<span sid='32546' title='32546'>It is only within the last few weeks that he has returned, after a year's absence, to High Gable. </span>
<span sid='32547' title='32547'>I may add that he is enormously rich, and whatever his whims may be he can very easily satisfy them. </span>
<span sid='32548' title='32548'>For the rest, his house is full of butlers, footmen, maid-servants, and the usual overfed, underworked staff of a large English country-house.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32549' title='32549'>'So much I learned partly from village gossip and partly from my own observation. </span>
<span sid='32550' title='32550'>There are no better instruments than discharged servants with a grievance, and I was lucky enough to find one. </span>
<span sid='32551' title='32551'>I call it luck, but it would not have come my way had I not been looking out for it. </span>
<span sid='32552' title='32552'>As Baynes remarks, we all have our systems. </span>
<span sid='32553' title='32553'>It was my system which enabled me to find John Warner, late gardener of High Gable, sacked in a moment of temper by his imperious employer. </span>
<span sid='32554' title='32554'>He in turn had friends among the indoor servants, who unite in their fear and dislike of their master. </span>
<span sid='32555' title='32555'>So I had my key to the secrets of the establishment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32556' title='32556'>'Curious people, Watson! </span>
<span sid='32557' title='32557'>I don't pretend to understand it all yet, but very curious people anyway. </span>
<span sid='32558' title='32558'>It's a double-winged house, and the servants live on one side, the family on the other. </span>
<span sid='32559' title='32559'>There's no link between the two save for Henderson's own servant, who serves the family's meals. </span>
<span sid='32560' title='32560'>Everything is carried to a certain door, which forms the one connection. </span>
<span sid='32561' title='32561'>Governess and children hardly go out at all, except into the garden. </span>
<span sid='32562' title='32562'>Henderson never by any chance walks alone. </span>
<span sid='32563' title='32563'>His dark secretary is like his shadow. </span>
<span sid='32564' title='32564'>The gossip among the servants is that their master is terribly afraid of something. </span>
<span sid='32565' title='32565'>"Sold his soul to the devil in exchange for money," says Warner, "and expects his creditor to come up and claim his own." </span>
<span sid='32566' title='32566'>Where they came from, or who they are, nobody has an idea. </span>
<span sid='32567' title='32567'>They are very violent. </span>
<span sid='32568' title='32568'>Twice Henderson has lashed at folk with his dog-whip, and only his long purse and heavy compensation have kept him out of the courts.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32569' title='32569'>'Well, now, Watson, let us judge the situation by this new information. </span>
<span sid='32570' title='32570'>We may take it that the letter came out of this strange household, and was an invitation to Garcia to carry out some attempt which had already been planned. </span>
<span sid='32571' title='32571'>Who wrote the note? </span>
<span sid='32572' title='32572'>It was someone within the citadel, and it was a woman. </span>
<span sid='32573' title='32573'>Who then, but Miss Burnet, the governess? </span>
<span sid='32574' title='32574'>All our reasoning seems to point that way. </span>
<span sid='32575' title='32575'>At any rate, we may take it as a hypothesis, and see what consequences it would entail. </span>
<span sid='32576' title='32576'>I may add that Miss Burnet's age and character make it certain that my first idea that there might be a love interest in our story is out of the question.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32577' title='32577'>'If she wrote the note she was presumably the friend and confederate of Garcia. </span>
<span sid='32578' title='32578'>What, then, might she be expected to do if she heard of his death? </span>
<span sid='32579' title='32579'>If he met it in some nefarious enterprise her lips might be sealed. </span>
<span sid='32580' title='32580'>Still, in her heart she must retain bitterness and hatred against those who had killed him, and would presumably help so far as she could to have revenge upon them. </span>
<span sid='32581' title='32581'>Could we see her, then, and try to use her? </span>
<span sid='32582' title='32582'>That was my first thought. </span>
<span sid='32583' title='32583'>But now we come to a sinister fact. </span>
<span sid='32584' title='32584'>Miss Burnet has not been seen by any human eye since the night of the murder. </span>
<span sid='32585' title='32585'>From that evening she has utterly vanished. </span>
<span sid='32586' title='32586'>Is she alive? </span>
<span sid='32587' title='32587'>Has she perhaps met her end on the same night as the friend whom she had summoned? </span>
<span sid='32588' title='32588'>Or is she merely a prisoner? </span>
<span sid='32589' title='32589'>There is the point which we still have to decide.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32590' title='32590'>'You will appreciate the difficulty of the situation, Watson. </span>
<span sid='32591' title='32591'>There is nothing upon which we can apply for a warrant. </span>
<span sid='32592' title='32592'>Our whole scheme might seem fantastic if laid before a magistrate. </span>
<span sid='32593' title='32593'>The woman's disappearance counts for nothing, since in that extraordinary household any member of it might be invisible for a week. </span>
<span sid='32594' title='32594'>And yet she may at the present moment be in danger of her life. </span>
<span sid='32595' title='32595'>All I can do is to watch the house and leave my agent, Warner, on guard at the gates. </span>
<span sid='32596' title='32596'>We can't let such a situation continue. </span>
<span sid='32597' title='32597'>If the law can do nothing we must take the risk ourselves.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32598' title='32598'>'What do you suggest?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32599' title='32599'>'I know which is her room. </span>
<span sid='32600' title='32600'>It is accessible from the top of an outhouse. </span>
<span sid='32601' title='32601'>My suggestion is that you and I go to-night and see if we can strike at the very heart of the mystery.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32602' title='32602'>It was not, I must confess, a very alluring prospect. </span>
<span sid='32603' title='32603'>The old house with its atmosphere of murder, the singular and formidable inhabitants, the unknown dangers of the approach, and the fact that we were putting ourselves legally in a false position, all combined to damp my ardour. </span>
<span sid='32604' title='32604'>But there was something in the ice-cold reasoning of Holmes which made it impossible to shrink from any adventure which he might recommend. </span>
<span sid='32605' title='32605'>One knew that thus, and only thus, could a solution be found. </span>
<span sid='32606' title='32606'>I clasped his hand in silence, and the die was cast.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32607' title='32607'>But it was not destined that our investigation should have so adventurous an ending. </span>
<span sid='32608' title='32608'>It was about five o'clock, and the shadows of the March evening were beginning to fall, when an excited rustic rushed into our room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32609' title='32609'>'They've gone, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='32610' title='32610'>They went by the last train. </span>
<span sid='32611' title='32611'>The lady broke away, and I've got her in a cab downstairs.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32612' title='32612'>'Excellent, Warner!' cried Holmes, springing to his feet. </span>
<span sid='32613' title='32613'>'Watson, the gaps are closing rapidly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32614' title='32614'>In the cab was a woman, half-collapsed from nervous exhaustion. </span>
<span sid='32615' title='32615'>She bore upon her aquiline and emaciated face the traces of some recent tragedy. </span>
<span sid='32616' title='32616'>Her head hung listlessly upon her breast, but as she raised it and turned her dull eyes upon us, I saw that her pupils were dark dots in the centre of the broad grey iris. </span>
<span sid='32617' title='32617'>She was drugged with opium.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32618' title='32618'>'I watched at the gate, same as you advised, Mr Holmes,' said our emissary, the discharged gardener. </span>
<span sid='32619' title='32619'>'When the carriage came out I followed it to the station. </span>
<span sid='32620' title='32620'>She was like one walking in her sleep, but when they tried to get her into the train she came to life and struggled. </span>
<span sid='32621' title='32621'>They pushed her into the carriage. </span>
<span sid='32622' title='32622'>She fought her way out again. </span>
<span sid='32623' title='32623'>I took her part, got her into a cab, and here we are. </span>
<span sid='32624' title='32624'>I shan't forget the face at the carriage window as I led her away. </span>
<span sid='32625' title='32625'>I'd have a short life if he had his way - the black-eyed, scowling, yellow devil.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32626' title='32626'>We carried her upstairs, laid her on the sofa, and a couple of cups of the strongest coffee soon cleared her brain from the mists of the drug. </span>
<span sid='32627' title='32627'>Baynes had been summoned by Holmes, and the situation rapidly explained to him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32628' title='32628'>'Why, sir, you've got me the very evidence I want,' said the inspector, warmly, shaking my friend by the hand. </span>
<span sid='32629' title='32629'>'I was on the same scent as you from the first.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32630' title='32630'>'What! </span>
<span sid='32631' title='32631'>You were after Henderson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32632' title='32632'>'Why, Mr Holmes, when you were crawling in the shrubbery at High Gable I was up one of the trees in the plantation and saw you down below. </span>
<span sid='32633' title='32633'>It was just who would get his evidence first.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32634' title='32634'>'Then why did you arrest the mulatto?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32635' title='32635'>Baynes chuckled.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32636' title='32636'>'I was sure Henderson, as he calls himself, felt that he was suspected, and that he would he low and make no move so long as he thought he was in any danger. </span>
<span sid='32637' title='32637'>I arrested the wrong man to make him believe that our eyes were off him. </span>
<span sid='32638' title='32638'>I knew he would be likely to clear off then and give us a chance of getting at Miss Burnet.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32639' title='32639'>Holmes laid his hand upon the inspector's shoulder.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32640' title='32640'>'You will rise high in your profession. </span>
<span sid='32641' title='32641'>You have instinct and intuition,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32642' title='32642'>Baynes flushed with pleasure.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32643' title='32643'>'I've had a plain-clothes man waiting at the station all the week. </span>
<span sid='32644' title='32644'>Wherever the High Gable folk go he will keep them in sight. </span>
<span sid='32645' title='32645'>But he must have been hard put to it when Miss Burnet broke away. </span>
<span sid='32646' title='32646'>However, your man picked her up, and it all ends well. </span>
<span sid='32647' title='32647'>We can't arrest without her evidence, that is clear, so the sooner we get a statement the better.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32648' title='32648'>'Every minute she gets stronger,' said Holmes, glancing at the governess. </span>
<span sid='32649' title='32649'>'But tell me, Baynes, who is this man Henderson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32650' title='32650'>'Henderson', the inspector answered, 'is Don Murillo, once called the Tiger of San Pedro.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32651' title='32651'>The Tiger of San Pedro! </span>
<span sid='32652' title='32652'>The whole history of the man came back to me in a flash. </span>
<span sid='32653' title='32653'>He had made his name as the most lewd and bloodthirsty tyrant that had ever governed any country with a pretence to civilization. </span>
<span sid='32654' title='32654'>Strong, fearless, and energetic, he had sufficient virtue to enable him to impose his odious vices upon a cowering people for ten or twelve years. </span>
<span sid='32655' title='32655'>His name was a terror through all Central <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>. </span>
<span sid='32656' title='32656'>At the end of that time there was a universal rising against him. </span>
<span sid='32657' title='32657'>But he was as cunning as he was cruel, and at the first whisper of coming trouble he had secretly conveyed his treasures aboard a ship which was manned by devoted adherents. </span>
<span sid='32658' title='32658'>It was an empty palace which was stormed by the insurgents next day. </span>
<span sid='32659' title='32659'>The Dictator, his two children, his secretary, and his wealth had all escaped them. </span>
<span sid='32660' title='32660'>From that moment he had vanished from the world, and his identity had been a frequent subject for comment in the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>an Press.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32661' title='32661'>'Yes, sir, Don Murillo, the Tiger of San Pedro,' said Baynes. </span>
<span sid='32662' title='32662'>'If you look it up you will find that the San Pedro colours are green and white, same as in the note, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='32663' title='32663'>Henderson he called himself, but I traced him back, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Paris&t=h'>Paris</a> and Rome and <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Madrid&t=h'>Madrid</a> to Barcelona, where his ship came in in '86. </span>
<span sid='32664' title='32664'>They've been looking for him all the time for their revenge, but it is only now that they have begun to find him out.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32665' title='32665'>'They discovered him a year ago,' said Miss Burnet, who had sat up and was now intently following the conversation. </span>
<span sid='32666' title='32666'>'Once already his life has been attempted, but some evil spirit shielded him. </span>
<span sid='32667' title='32667'>Now, again, it is the noble, chivalrous Garcia who has fallen, while the monster goes safe. </span>
<span sid='32668' title='32668'>But another will come, and yet another, until some day justice will be done, that is as certain as the rise of to-morrow's sun.' </span>
<span sid='32669' title='32669'>Her thin hands clenched, and her worn face blanched with the passion of her hatred.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32670' title='32670'>'But how come you into this matter, Miss Burnet?' asked Holmes. </span>
<span sid='32671' title='32671'>'How can an English lady join in such a murderous affair?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32672' title='32672'>'I join in it because there is no other way in the world by which justice can be gained. </span>
<span sid='32673' title='32673'>What does the law of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> care for the rivers of blood shed years ago in San Pedro, or for the ship-load of treasure which this man has stolen? </span>
<span sid='32674' title='32674'>To you they are like crimes committed in some other planet. </span>
<span sid='32675' title='32675'>But we know. </span>
<span sid='32676' title='32676'>We have learned the truth in sorrow and in suffering. </span>
<span sid='32677' title='32677'>To us there is no fiend in hell like Juan Murillo, and no peace in life while his victims still cry for vengeance.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32678' title='32678'>'No doubt,' said Holmes, 'he was as you say. </span>
<span sid='32679' title='32679'>I have heard that he was atrocious. </span>
<span sid='32680' title='32680'>But how are you affected?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32681' title='32681'>'I will tell you it all. </span>
<span sid='32682' title='32682'>This villain's policy was to murder, on one pretext or another, every man who showed such promise that he might in time come to be a dangerous rival.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32683' title='32683'>My husband - yes, my real name is SeÃ±ora Victor Durando - was the San Pedro Minister in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='32684' title='32684'>He met me and married me there. </span>
<span sid='32685' title='32685'>A nobler man never lived upon earth. </span>
<span sid='32686' title='32686'>Unhappily, Murillo heard of his excellence, recalled him on some pretext, and had him shot. </span>
<span sid='32687' title='32687'>With a premonition of his fate he had refused to take me with him. </span>
<span sid='32688' title='32688'>His estates were confiscated, and I was left with a pittance and a broken heart.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32689' title='32689'>'Then came the downfall of the tyrant. </span>
<span sid='32690' title='32690'>He escaped as you have just described. </span>
<span sid='32691' title='32691'>But the many whose lives he had ruined, whose nearest and dearest had suffered torture and death at his hands, would not let the matter rest. </span>
<span sid='32692' title='32692'>They banded themselves into a society which should never be dissolved until the work was done. </span>
<span sid='32693' title='32693'>It was my part after we had discovered in the transformed Henderson the fallen despot, to attach myself to his household and keep the others in touch with his movements. </span>
<span sid='32694' title='32694'>This I was able to do by securing the position of governess in his family. </span>
<span sid='32695' title='32695'>He little knew that the woman who faced him at every meal was the woman whose husband he had hurried at an hour's notice into eternity. </span>
<span sid='32696' title='32696'>I smiled on him, did my duty to his children, and bided my time. </span>
<span sid='32697' title='32697'>An attempt was made in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Paris&t=h'>Paris</a>, and failed. </span>
<span sid='32698' title='32698'>We zigzagged swiftly here and there over <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>, to throw off the pursuers, and finally returned to this house, which he had taken upon his first arrival in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32699' title='32699'>'But here also the ministers of justice were waiting. </span>
<span sid='32700' title='32700'>Knowing that he would return there, Garcia, who is the son of the former highest dignitary in San Pedro, was waiting with two trusty companions of humble station, all three fired with the same reasons for revenge. </span>
<span sid='32701' title='32701'>He could do little during the day, for Murillo took every precaution, and never went out save with his satellite Lucas, or Lopez as he was known in the days of his greatness. </span>
<span sid='32702' title='32702'>At night, however, he slept alone, and the avenger might find him. </span>
<span sid='32703' title='32703'>On a certain evening, which had been prearranged, I sent my friend final instructions, for the man was for ever on the alert, and continually changed his room. </span>
<span sid='32704' title='32704'>I was to see that the doors were open and the signal of a green or white light in a window which faced the drive was to give notice if all was safe, or if the attempt had better be postponed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32705' title='32705'>'But everything went wrong with us. </span>
<span sid='32706' title='32706'>In some way I had excited the suspicion of Lopez, the secretary. </span>
<span sid='32707' title='32707'>He crept up behind me, and sprang upon me just as I had finished the note. </span>
<span sid='32708' title='32708'>He and his master dragged me to my room, and held judgement upon me as a convicted traitress. </span>
<span sid='32709' title='32709'>Then and there they would have plunged their knives into me, could they have seen how to escape the consequence of the deed. </span>
<span sid='32710' title='32710'>Finally, after much debate, they concluded that my murder was too dangerous. </span>
<span sid='32711' title='32711'>But they determined to get rid for ever of Garcia. </span>
<span sid='32712' title='32712'>They had gagged me, and Murillo twisted my arm round until I gave him the address. </span>
<span sid='32713' title='32713'>I swear that he might have twisted it off had I understood what it would mean to Garcia. </span>
<span sid='32714' title='32714'>Lopez addressed the note which I had written, sealed it with his sleeve-link, and sent it by the hand of the servant, JosÃ©. </span>
<span sid='32715' title='32715'>How they murdered him I do not know, save that it was Murillo's hand who struck him down, for Lopez had remained to guard me. </span>
<span sid='32716' title='32716'>I believe he must have waited among the gorse bushes through which the path winds and struck him down as he passed. </span>
<span sid='32717' title='32717'>At first they were of a mind to let him enter the house and to kill him as a detected burglar, but they argued that if they were mixed up in an inquiry their own identity would at once be publicly disclosed and they would be open to further attacks. </span>
<span sid='32718' title='32718'>With the death of Garcia the pursuit might cease, since such a death might frighten others from the task.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32719' title='32719'>'All would now have been well for them had it not been for my knowledge of what they had done. </span>
<span sid='32720' title='32720'>I have no doubt that there were times when my life hung in the balance. </span>
<span sid='32721' title='32721'>I was confined to my room, terrorized by the most horrible threats, cruelly ill-used to break my spirit - see this stab on my shoulder and the bruises from end to end of my arms - and a gag was thrust into my mouth on the one occasion when I tried to call from the window. </span>
<span sid='32722' title='32722'>For five days this cruel imprisonment continued, with hardly enough food to hold body and soul together. </span>
<span sid='32723' title='32723'>This afternoon a good lunch was brought me, but the moment after I took it I knew that I had been drugged. </span>
<span sid='32724' title='32724'>In a sort of dream I remember being half-led, half-carried to the carriage, in the same state I was conveyed to the train. </span>
<span sid='32725' title='32725'>Only then, when the wheels were almost moving, did I suddenly realize that my liberty lay in my own hands. </span>
<span sid='32726' title='32726'>I sprang out, they tried to drag me back, and had it not been for the help of this good man, who led me to the cab, I should never have broken away. </span>
<span sid='32727' title='32727'>Now, thank God, I am beyond their power for ever.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32728' title='32728'>We had all listened intently to this remarkable statement. </span>
<span sid='32729' title='32729'>It was Holmes who broke the silence.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32730' title='32730'>'Our difficulties are not over,' he remarked, shaking his head. </span>
<span sid='32731' title='32731'>'Our police work ends, but our legal work begins.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32732' title='32732'>'Exactly,' said I. </span>
<span sid='32733' title='32733'>'A plausible lawyer could make it out as an act of self-defence. </span>
<span sid='32734' title='32734'>There may be a hundred crimes in the background, but it is only on this one that they can be tried.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32735' title='32735'>'Come, come,' said Baynes, cheerily, 'I think better of the law than that. </span>
<span sid='32736' title='32736'>Self-defence is one thing. </span>
<span sid='32737' title='32737'>To entice a man in cold blood with the object of murdering him is another, whatever danger you may fear from him. </span>
<span sid='32738' title='32738'>No, no, we shall all be justified when we see the tenants of High Gable at the next Guildford Assizes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32739' title='32739'>It is a matter of history, however, that a little time was still to elapse before the Tiger of San Pedro should meet with his deserts. </span>
<span sid='32740' title='32740'>Wily and bold, he and his companion threw their pursuer off their track by entering a lodging-house in Edmonton Street and leaving by the back-gate into Curzon Square. </span>
<span sid='32741' title='32741'>From that day they were seen no more in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>. </span>
<span sid='32742' title='32742'>Some six months afterwards the Marquess of Montalva and Signor Rulli, his secretary, were both murdered in their rooms at the Hotel Escurial at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Madrid&t=h'>Madrid</a>. </span>
<span sid='32743' title='32743'>The crime was ascribed to Nihilism, and the murderers were never arrested. </span>
<span sid='32744' title='32744'>Inspector Baynes visited us at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> with a printed description of the dark face of the secretary, and of the masterful features, the magnetic black eyes, and the tufted brows of his master. </span>
<span sid='32745' title='32745'>We could not doubt that justice, if belated, had come at last.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32746' title='32746'>'A chaotic case, my dear Watson,' said Holmes, over an evening pipe. </span>
<span sid='32747' title='32747'>'It will not be possible for you to present it in that compact form which is dear to your heart. </span>
<span sid='32748' title='32748'>It covers two continents, concerns two groups of mysterious persons, and is further complicated by the highly respectable presence of our friend Scott Eccles, whose inclusion shows me that the deceased Garcia had a scheming mind and a well-developed instinct of self-preservation. </span>
<span sid='32749' title='32749'>It is remarkable only for the fact that amid a perfect jungle of possibilities we, with our worthy collaborator the inspector, have kept our close hold on the essentials and so been guided along the crooked and winding path. </span>
<span sid='32750' title='32750'>Is there any point which is not quite clear to you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32751' title='32751'>'The object of the mulatto cook's return?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32752' title='32752'>'I think that the strange creature in the kitchen may account for it. </span>
<span sid='32753' title='32753'>The man was a primitive savage from the backwoods of San Pedro, and this was his fetish. </span>
<span sid='32754' title='32754'>When his companion and he had fled to some prearranged retreat-already occupied, no doubt by a confederate - the companion had persuaded him to leave so compromising an article of furniture. </span>
<span sid='32755' title='32755'>But the mulatto's heart was with it, and he was driven back to it next day, when, on reconnoitring through the window, he found policeman Walters in possession. </span>
<span sid='32756' title='32756'>He waited three days longer, and then his piety or his superstition drove him to try once more. </span>
<span sid='32757' title='32757'>Inspector Baynes, who, with his usual astuteness, had minimized the incident before me, had really recognized its importance, and had left a trap into which the creature walked. </span>
<span sid='32758' title='32758'>Any other point, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32759' title='32759'>'The torn bird, the pail of blood, the charred bones, all the mystery of that weird kitchen?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32760' title='32760'>Holmes smiled as he turned up an entry in his note-book.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32761' title='32761'>'I spent a morning in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the British Museum&t=h'>the British Museum</a> reading up that and other points. </span>
<span sid='32762' title='32762'>Here is a quotation from Eckermann Voodooism and the Negroid Religions:</span>
<p>
<span sid='32763' title='32763'>The true Voodoo-worshipper attempts nothing of importance without certain sacrifices which are intended to propitiate his unclean gods. </span>
<span sid='32764' title='32764'>In extreme cases these rites take the form of human sacrifices followed by cannibalism. </span>
<span sid='32765' title='32765'>The more usual victims are a white cock, which is plucked in pieces alive, or a black goat, whose throat is cut and body burned.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32766' title='32766'>'So you see our savage friend was very orthodox in his ritual. </span>
<span sid='32767' title='32767'>It is grotesque, Watson,' Holmes added, as he slowly fastened his notebook, 'but, as I have had occasion to remark, there is but one step from the grotesque to the horrible.'</span>
