<p>
<span sid='18986' title='18986'>Mr Sherlock Holmes was always of opinion that I should publish the singular facts connected with Professor Presbury, if only to dispel once for all the ugly rumours which some twenty years ago agitated the University and were echoed in the learned societies of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='18987' title='18987'>There were, however, certain obstacles in the way, and the true history of this curious case remained entombed in the tin box which contains so many records of my friend's adventures. </span>
<span sid='18988' title='18988'>Now we have at last obtained permission to ventilate the facts which formed one of the very last cases handled by Holmes before his retirement from practice. </span>
<span sid='18989' title='18989'>Even now a certain reticence and discretion have to be observed in laying the matter before the public.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18990' title='18990'>It was one Sunday evening early in September of the year 1903 that I received one of the Holmes's laconic messages: 'Come at once if convenient - if inconvenient come all the same. </span>
<span sid='18991' title='18991'>- SH.' </span>
<span sid='18992' title='18992'>The relations between us in those latter days were peculiar. </span>
<span sid='18993' title='18993'>He was a man of habits, narrow and concentrated habits, and I had become one of them. </span>
<span sid='18994' title='18994'>As an institution I was like the violin, the shag tobacco, the old black pipe, the index books, and others perhaps less excusable. </span>
<span sid='18995' title='18995'>When it was a case of active work and a comrade was needed upon whose nerve he could place some reliance, my rôle was obvious. </span>
<span sid='18996' title='18996'>But apart from this I had uses. </span>
<span sid='18997' title='18997'>I was a whetstone for his mind. </span>
<span sid='18998' title='18998'>I stimulated him. </span>
<span sid='18999' title='18999'>He liked to think aloud in my presence. </span>
<span sid='19000' title='19000'>His remarks could hardly be said to be made to me - many of them would have been as appropriately addressed to his bedstead - but none the less, having formed the habit, it had become in some way helpful that I should register and interject. </span>
<span sid='19001' title='19001'>If I irritated him by a certain methodical slowness in my mentality, that irritation served only to make his own flame-like intuitions and impressions flash up the more vividly and swiftly. </span>
<span sid='19002' title='19002'>Such was my humble rôle in our alliance.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19003' title='19003'>When I arrived at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> I found him huddled up in his arm-chair with updrawn knees, his pipe in his mouth and his brow furrowed with thought. </span>
<span sid='19004' title='19004'>It was clear that he was in the throes of some vexatious problem. </span>
<span sid='19005' title='19005'>With a wave of his hand he indicated my old arm-chair, but otherwise for half an hour he gave no sign that he was aware of my presence. </span>
<span sid='19006' title='19006'>Then with a start he seemed to come from his reverie, and, with his usual whimsical smile, he greeted me back to what had once been my home.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19007' title='19007'>'You will excuse a certain abstraction of mind, my dear Watson,' said he. </span>
<span sid='19008' title='19008'>'Some curious facts have been submitted to me within the last twenty-four hours, and they in turn have given rise to some speculations of a more general character. </span>
<span sid='19009' title='19009'>I have serious thoughts of writing a small monograph upon the uses of dogs in the work of the detective.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19010' title='19010'>'But surely, Holmes, this has been explored,' said I. </span>
<span sid='19011' title='19011'>'Bloodhounds - sleuth-hounds-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19012' title='19012'>'No, no, Watson, that side of the matter is, of course, obvious. </span>
<span sid='19013' title='19013'>But there is another which is far more subtle. </span>
<span sid='19014' title='19014'>You may recollect that in the case which you, in your sensational way, coupled with the Copper Beeches, I was able, by watching the mind of the child, to form a deduction as to the criminal habits of the very smug and respectable father.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19015' title='19015'>'Yes, I remember it well.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19016' title='19016'>'My line of thoughts about dogs is analogous. </span>
<span sid='19017' title='19017'>A dog reflects the family life. </span>
<span sid='19018' title='19018'>Whoever saw a frisky dog in a gloomy family, or a sad dog in a happy one? </span>
<span sid='19019' title='19019'>Snarling people have snarling dogs, dangerous people have dangerous ones. </span>
<span sid='19020' title='19020'>And their passing moods may reflect the passing moods of others.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19021' title='19021'>I shook my head. </span>
<span sid='19022' title='19022'>'Surely, Holmes, this is a little farfetched,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19023' title='19023'>He had refilled his pipe and resumed his seat, taking no notice of my comment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19024' title='19024'>'The practical application of what I have said is very close to the problem which I am investigating. </span>
<span sid='19025' title='19025'>It is a tangled skein, you understand, and I am looking for a loose end. </span>
<span sid='19026' title='19026'>One possible loose end lies in the question: Why does Professor Presbury's faithful wolf-hound, Roy, endeavour to bite him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19027' title='19027'>I sank back in my chair in some disappointment. </span>
<span sid='19028' title='19028'>Was it for so trivial a question as this that I had been summoned from my work? </span>
<span sid='19029' title='19029'>Holmes glanced across at me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19030' title='19030'>'The same old Watson!' said he. </span>
<span sid='19031' title='19031'>'You never learn that the gravest issues may depend upon the smallest things. </span>
<span sid='19032' title='19032'>But is it not on the face of it strange that a staid, elderly philosopher - you've heard of Presbury, of course, the famous Camford physiologist? - that such a man, whose friend has been his devoted wolf-hound, should now have been twice attacked by his own dog? </span>
<span sid='19033' title='19033'>What do you make of it?</span>
<p>
<span sid='19034' title='19034'>'The dog is ill.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19035' title='19035'>'Well, that has to be considered. </span>
<span sid='19036' title='19036'>But he attacks no one else, nor does he apparently molest his master, save on very special occasions. </span>
<span sid='19037' title='19037'>Curious, Watson - very curious. </span>
<span sid='19038' title='19038'>But young Mr Bennett is before his time, if that is his ring. </span>
<span sid='19039' title='19039'>I had hoped to have a longer chat with you before he came.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19040' title='19040'>There was a quick step on the stairs, a sharp tap at the door, and a moment later the new client presented himself. </span>
<span sid='19041' title='19041'>He was a tall, handsome youth about thirty, well dressed and elegant, but with something in his bearing which suggested the shyness of the student rather than the selfpossession of the man of the world. </span>
<span sid='19042' title='19042'>He shook hands with Holmes, and then looked with some surprise at me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19043' title='19043'>'This matter is very delicate, Mr Holmes,' he said. </span>
<span sid='19044' title='19044'>'Consider the relation in which I stand to Professor Presbury, both privately and publicly. </span>
<span sid='19045' title='19045'>I really can hardly justify myself if I speak before any third person.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19046' title='19046'>'Have no fear, Mr Bennett. </span>
<span sid='19047' title='19047'>Dr Watson is the very soul of discretion, and I can assure you that this is a matter in which I am very likely to need an assistant.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19048' title='19048'>'As you like, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='19049' title='19049'>You will, I am sure, understand my having some reserves in the matter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19050' title='19050'>'You will appreciate it, Watson, when I tell you that this gentleman, Mr Trevor Bennett, is professional assistant to the great scientist, lives under his roof, and is engaged to his only daughter. </span>
<span sid='19051' title='19051'>Certainly we must agree that the Professor has every claim upon his loyalty and devotion. </span>
<span sid='19052' title='19052'>But it may best be shown by taking the necessary steps to clear up this strange mystery.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19053' title='19053'>'I hope so, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='19054' title='19054'>That is my one object. </span>
<span sid='19055' title='19055'>Does Dr Watson know the situation?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19056' title='19056'>'I have not had time to explain it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19057' title='19057'>'Then perhaps I had better go over the ground again before explaining some fresh developments.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19058' title='19058'>'I will do so myself,' said Holmes, 'in order to show that I have the events in their due order. </span>
<span sid='19059' title='19059'>The Professor, Watson, is a man of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>an reputation. </span>
<span sid='19060' title='19060'>His life has been academic. </span>
<span sid='19061' title='19061'>There has never been a breath of scandal. </span>
<span sid='19062' title='19062'>He is a widower with one daughter, Edith. </span>
<span sid='19063' title='19063'>He is, I gather, a man of very virile and positive, one might almost say combative, character. </span>
<span sid='19064' title='19064'>So the matter stood until a very few months ago.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19065' title='19065'>'Then the current of his life was broken. </span>
<span sid='19066' title='19066'>He is sixty-one years of age, but he became engaged to the daughter of Professor Morphy, his colleague in the chair of Comparative Anatomy. </span>
<span sid='19067' title='19067'>It was not, as I understand, the reasoned courting of an elderly man, but rather the passionate frenzy of youth, for no one could have shown himself a more devoted lover. </span>
<span sid='19068' title='19068'>The lady, Alice Morphy, was a very perfect girl both in mind and body, so that there was every excuse for the Professor's infatuation. </span>
<span sid='19069' title='19069'>None the less, it did not meet with full approval in his own family.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19070' title='19070'>'We thought it rather excessive,' said our visitor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19071' title='19071'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='19072' title='19072'>Excessive and a little violent and unnatural. </span>
<span sid='19073' title='19073'>Professor Presbury was rich, however, and there was no objection upon the part of the father. </span>
<span sid='19074' title='19074'>The daughter, however, had other views, and there were already several candidates for her hand, who, if they were less eligible from a worldly point of view, were at least more of an age. </span>
<span sid='19075' title='19075'>The girl seemed to like the Professor in spite of his eccentricities. </span>
<span sid='19076' title='19076'>It was only age which stood in the way.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19077' title='19077'>'About this time a little mystery suddenly clouded the normal routine of the Professor's life. </span>
<span sid='19078' title='19078'>He did what he had never done before. </span>
<span sid='19079' title='19079'>He left home and gave no indication where he was going. </span>
<span sid='19080' title='19080'>He was away a fortnight, and returned looking rather travel-worn. </span>
<span sid='19081' title='19081'>He made no allusion to where he had been, although he was usually the frankest of men. </span>
<span sid='19082' title='19082'>It chanced, 'however, that our client here, Mr Bennett, received a letter from a fellow-student in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Prague&t=h'>Prague</a>, who said that he was glad to have seen Professor Presbury there, although he had not been able to talk to him. </span>
<span sid='19083' title='19083'>Only in this way did his own household learn where he had been.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19084' title='19084'>'Now comes the point. </span>
<span sid='19085' title='19085'>From that time onwards a curious change came over the Professor. </span>
<span sid='19086' title='19086'>He became furtive and sly. </span>
<span sid='19087' title='19087'>Those around him had always the feeling that he was not the man that they had known, but that he was under some shadow which had darkened his higher qualities. </span>
<span sid='19088' title='19088'>His intellect was not affected. </span>
<span sid='19089' title='19089'>His lectures were as brilliant as ever. </span>
<span sid='19090' title='19090'>But always there was something new, something sinister and unexpected. </span>
<span sid='19091' title='19091'>His daughter, who was devoted to him, tried again and again to resume the old relations and to penetrate this mask which her father seemed to have put on. </span>
<span sid='19092' title='19092'>You, sir, as I understand, did the same - but all was in vain. </span>
<span sid='19093' title='19093'>And now, Mr Bennett, tell in your own words the incident of the letters.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19094' title='19094'>'You must understand, Dr Watson, that the Professor had no secrets from me. </span>
<span sid='19095' title='19095'>If I were his son or his younger brother, I could not have more completely enjoyed his confidence. </span>
<span sid='19096' title='19096'>As his secretary I handled every paper which came to him, and I opened and subdivided his letters. </span>
<span sid='19097' title='19097'>Shortly after his return all this was changed. </span>
<span sid='19098' title='19098'>He told me that certain letters might come to him from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> which would be marked by a cross under the stamp. </span>
<span sid='19099' title='19099'>These were to be set aside for his own eyes only. </span>
<span sid='19100' title='19100'>I may say that several of these did pass through my hands, that they had the E.C. mark, and were in an illiterate handwriting. </span>
<span sid='19101' title='19101'>If he answered them at all the answers did not pass through my hands nor into the letter-basket in which our correspondence was collected.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19102' title='19102'>'And the box,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19103' title='19103'>'Ah, yes, the box. </span>
<span sid='19104' title='19104'>The Professor brought back a little wooden box from his travels. </span>
<span sid='19105' title='19105'>It was the one thing which suggested a Continental tour, for it was one of those quaint carved things which one associates with <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Germany&t=h'>Germany</a>. </span>
<span sid='19106' title='19106'>This he placed in his instrument cupboard. </span>
<span sid='19107' title='19107'>One day, in looking for a cannula, I took up the box. </span>
<span sid='19108' title='19108'>To my surprise he was very angry, and reproved me in words which were quite savage for my curiosity. </span>
<span sid='19109' title='19109'>It was the first time such a thing had happened and I was deeply hurt. </span>
<span sid='19110' title='19110'>I endeavoured to explain that it was a mere accident that I had touched the box, but all the evening I was conscious that he looked at me harshly and that the incident was rankling in his mind.' </span>
<span sid='19111' title='19111'>Mr Bennett drew a little diary book from his pocket. </span>
<span sid='19112' title='19112'>'That was on July 2nd,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19113' title='19113'>'You are certainly an admirable witness,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='19114' title='19114'>'I may need some of these dates which you have noted.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19115' title='19115'>'I learned method among other things from my great teacher. </span>
<span sid='19116' title='19116'>From the time that I observed abnormality in his behaviour I felt that it was my duty to study his case. </span>
<span sid='19117' title='19117'>Thus I have it here that it was on that very day, July 2nd, that Roy attacked the Professor as he came from his study into the hall. </span>
<span sid='19118' title='19118'>Again on July 11th there was a scene of the same sort, and then I have a note of yet another upon July 20th. </span>
<span sid='19119' title='19119'>After that we had to banish Roy to the stables. </span>
<span sid='19120' title='19120'>He was a dear, affectionate animal - but I fear I weary you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19121' title='19121'>Mr Bennett spoke in a tone of reproach, for it was very clear that Holmes was not listening. </span>
<span sid='19122' title='19122'>His face was rigid and his eyes gazed abstractedly at the ceiling. </span>
<span sid='19123' title='19123'>With an effort he recovered himself.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19124' title='19124'>'Singular! </span>
<span sid='19125' title='19125'>Most singular!' he murmured. </span>
<span sid='19126' title='19126'>'These details were new to me, Mr Bennett. </span>
<span sid='19127' title='19127'>I think we have now fairly gone over the old ground, have we not? </span>
<span sid='19128' title='19128'>But you spoke of some fresh developments.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19129' title='19129'>The pleasant, open face of our visitor clouded over, shadowed by some grim remembrance. </span>
<span sid='19130' title='19130'>'What I speak of occurred the night before last,' said he. </span>
<span sid='19131' title='19131'>'I was lying awake about two in the morning, when I was aware of a dull muffled sound coming from the passage. </span>
<span sid='19132' title='19132'>I opened my door and peeped out. </span>
<span sid='19133' title='19133'>I should explain that the Professor sleeps at the end of the passage-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19134' title='19134'>'The date being - asked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19135' title='19135'>Our visitor was clearly annoyed at so irrelevant an interruption.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19136' title='19136'>'I have said, sir, that it was the night before last - that is, September 4th.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19137' title='19137'>Holmes nodded and smiled.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19138' title='19138'>'Pray continue,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19139' title='19139'>'He sleeps at the end of the passage, and would have to pass my door in order to reach the staircase. </span>
<span sid='19140' title='19140'>It was a really terrifying experience, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='19141' title='19141'>I think that I am as strong-nerved as my neighbours, but I was shaken by what I saw. </span>
<span sid='19142' title='19142'>The passage was dark save that one window half-way along it threw a patch of light. </span>
<span sid='19143' title='19143'>I could see that something was coming along the passage, something dark and crouching. </span>
<span sid='19144' title='19144'>Then suddenly it emerged into the light, and I saw that it was he. </span>
<span sid='19145' title='19145'>He was crawling, Mr Holmes - crawling! </span>
<span sid='19146' title='19146'>He was not quite on his hands and knees. </span>
<span sid='19147' title='19147'>I should rather say on his hands and feet, with his face sunk between his hands. </span>
<span sid='19148' title='19148'>Yet he seemed to move with ease. </span>
<span sid='19149' title='19149'>I was so paralysed by the sight that it was not until he had reached my door that I was able to step forward and ask if I could assist him. </span>
<span sid='19150' title='19150'>His answer was extraordinary. </span>
<span sid='19151' title='19151'>He sprang up, spat out some atrocious word at me, and hurried on past me, and down the staircase. </span>
<span sid='19152' title='19152'>I waited about for an hour, but he did not come back. </span>
<span sid='19153' title='19153'>It must have been daylight before he regained his room.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19154' title='19154'>'Well, Watson, what make you of that?' asked Holmes, with the air of the pathologist who presents a rare specimen.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19155' title='19155'>'Lumbago, possibly. </span>
<span sid='19156' title='19156'>I have known a severe attack make a man walk in just such a way, and nothing would be more trying to the temper.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19157' title='19157'>'Good, Watson! </span>
<span sid='19158' title='19158'>You always keep us flat-footed on the ground. </span>
<span sid='19159' title='19159'>But we can hardly accept lumbago, since he was able to stand erect in a moment.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19160' title='19160'>'He was never better in health,' said Bennett. </span>
<span sid='19161' title='19161'>'In fact, he is stronger than I have known him for years. </span>
<span sid='19162' title='19162'>But there are the facts, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='19163' title='19163'>It is not a case in which we can consult the police, and yet we are utterly at our wits' end as to what to do, and we feel in some strange way that we are drifting towards disaster. </span>
<span sid='19164' title='19164'>Edith - Miss Presbury - feels as I do, that we cannot wait passively any longer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19165' title='19165'>'It is certainly a very curious and suggestive case. </span>
<span sid='19166' title='19166'>What do you think, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19167' title='19167'>'Speaking as a medical man,' said I, 'it appears to be a case for an alienist. </span>
<span sid='19168' title='19168'>The old gentleman's cerebral processes were disturbed by the love affair. </span>
<span sid='19169' title='19169'>He made a journey abroad in the hope of breaking himself of the passion. </span>
<span sid='19170' title='19170'>His letters and the box may be connected with some other private transaction - a loan, perhaps, or share certificates, which are in the box.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19171' title='19171'>'And the wolf-hound no doubt disapproved of the financial bargain. </span>
<span sid='19172' title='19172'>No, no, Watson, there is more in it than this. </span>
<span sid='19173' title='19173'>Now, I can only suggest-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19174' title='19174'>What Sherlock Holmes was about to suggest will never be known, for at this moment the door opened and a young lady was shown into the room. </span>
<span sid='19175' title='19175'>As she appeared Mr Bennett sprang up with a cry and ran forward with his hands out to meet those which she had herself outstretched.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19176' title='19176'>'Edith, dear! </span>
<span sid='19177' title='19177'>Nothing the matter, I hope?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19178' title='19178'>'I felt I must follow you. </span>
<span sid='19179' title='19179'>Oh, Jack, I have been so dreadfully frightened! </span>
<span sid='19180' title='19180'>It is awful to be there alone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19181' title='19181'>'Mr Holmes, this is the young lady I spoke of. </span>
<span sid='19182' title='19182'>This is my fiancée.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19183' title='19183'>'We were gradually coming to that conclusion, were we not, Watson?' Holmes answered, with a smile. </span>
<span sid='19184' title='19184'>'I take it, Miss Presbury, that there is some fresh development in the case, and that you thought we should know?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19185' title='19185'>Our new visitor, a bright, handsome girl of a conventional English type, smiled back at Holmes as she seated herself beside Mr Bennett.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19186' title='19186'>'When I found Mr Bennett had left his hotel I thought I should probably find him here. </span>
<span sid='19187' title='19187'>Of course, he had told me that he would consult you. </span>
<span sid='19188' title='19188'>But, oh, Mr Holmes, can you do nothing for my poor father?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19189' title='19189'>'I have hopes, Miss Presbury, but the case is still obscure. </span>
<span sid='19190' title='19190'>Perhaps what you have to say may throw some fresh light upon it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19191' title='19191'>'It was last night, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='19192' title='19192'>He had been very strange all day. </span>
<span sid='19193' title='19193'>I am sure that there are times when he has no recollection of what he does. </span>
<span sid='19194' title='19194'>He lives as in a strange dream. </span>
<span sid='19195' title='19195'>Yesterday was such a day. </span>
<span sid='19196' title='19196'>It was not my father with whom I lived. </span>
<span sid='19197' title='19197'>His outward shell was there, but it was not really he.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19198' title='19198'>'Tell me what happened.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19199' title='19199'>'I was awakened in the night by the dog barking most furiously. </span>
<span sid='19200' title='19200'>Poor Roy, he is chained now near the stable. </span>
<span sid='19201' title='19201'>I may say that I always sleep with my door locked, for, as Jack - as Mr Bennett - will tell you, we all have a feeling of impending danger. </span>
<span sid='19202' title='19202'>My room is on the second floor. </span>
<span sid='19203' title='19203'>It happened that the blind was up in my window, and there was bright moonlight outside. </span>
<span sid='19204' title='19204'>As I lay with my eyes fixed upon the square of light, listening to the frenzied barkings of the dog, I was amazed to see my father's face looking in at me. </span>
<span sid='19205' title='19205'>Mr Holmes, I nearly died of surprise and horror. </span>
<span sid='19206' title='19206'>There it was pressed against the window-pane, and one hand seemed to be raised as if to push up the window. </span>
<span sid='19207' title='19207'>If that window had opened, I think I should have gone mad. </span>
<span sid='19208' title='19208'>It was no delusion, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='19209' title='19209'>Don't deceive yourself by thinking so. </span>
<span sid='19210' title='19210'>I dare say it was twenty seconds or so that I lay paralysed and watched the face. </span>
<span sid='19211' title='19211'>Then it vanished, but I could not - I could not spring out of bed and look out after it. </span>
<span sid='19212' title='19212'>I lay cold and shivering till morning. </span>
<span sid='19213' title='19213'>At breakfast he was sharp and fierce in manner, and made no allusion to the adventure of the night. </span>
<span sid='19214' title='19214'>Neither did I, but I gave an excuse for coming to town - and here I am.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19215' title='19215'>Holmes looked thoroughly surprised at Miss Presbury's narrative.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19216' title='19216'>'My dear young lady, you say that your room is on the second floor. </span>
<span sid='19217' title='19217'>Is there a long ladder in the garden?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19218' title='19218'>'No, Mr Holmes, that is the amazing part of it. </span>
<span sid='19219' title='19219'>There is no possible way of reaching the window - and yet he was there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19220' title='19220'>'The date being September 5th,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='19221' title='19221'>'That certainly complicates matters.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19222' title='19222'>It was the young lady's turn to look surprised. </span>
<span sid='19223' title='19223'>'This is the second time that you have alluded to the date, Mr Holmes,' said Bennett. </span>
<span sid='19224' title='19224'>'Is it possible that it has any bearing upon the case?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19225' title='19225'>'It is possible - very possible - and yet I have not my full material at present.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19226' title='19226'>'Possibly you are thinking of the connection between insanity and phases of the moon?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19227' title='19227'>'No, I assure you. </span>
<span sid='19228' title='19228'>It was quite a different line of thought. </span>
<span sid='19229' title='19229'>Possibly you can leave your notebook with me and I will check the dates. </span>
<span sid='19230' title='19230'>Now I think, Watson, that our line of action is perfectly clear. </span>
<span sid='19231' title='19231'>This young lady has informed us - and I have the greatest confidence in her intuition - that her father remembers little or nothing which occurs upon certain dates. </span>
<span sid='19232' title='19232'>We will therefore call upon him as if he had given us an appointment upon such a date. </span>
<span sid='19233' title='19233'>He will put it down to his own lack of memory. </span>
<span sid='19234' title='19234'>Thus we will open our campaign by having a good close view of him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19235' title='19235'>'That is excellent,' said Mr Bennett. </span>
<span sid='19236' title='19236'>'I warn you, however, that the Professor is irascible and violent at times.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19237' title='19237'>Holmes smiled. </span>
<span sid='19238' title='19238'>'There are reasons why we should come at once - very cogent reasons if my theories hold good. </span>
<span sid='19239' title='19239'>To-morrow, Mr Bennett, will certainly see us in Camford. </span>
<span sid='19240' title='19240'>There is, if I remember right, an inn called the "Chequers" where the port used to be above mediocrity, and the linen was above reproach. </span>
<span sid='19241' title='19241'>I think, Watson, that our lot for the next few days might lie in less pleasant places.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19242' title='19242'>Monday morning found us on our way to the famous University town - an easy effort on the part of Holmes, who had no roots to pull up, but one which involved frantic planning and hurrying on my part, as my practice was by this time not inconsiderable. </span>
<span sid='19243' title='19243'>Holmes made no allusion to the case until after we had deposited our suit-cases at the ancient hostel of which he had spoken.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19244' title='19244'>'I think, Watson, that we can catch the Professor just before lunch. </span>
<span sid='19245' title='19245'>He lectures at eleven, and should have an interval at home.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19246' title='19246'>'What possible excuse have we for calling?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19247' title='19247'>Holmes glanced at his notebook.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19248' title='19248'>'There was a period of excitement upon August 25th. </span>
<span sid='19249' title='19249'>We will assume that he is a little hazy as to what he does at such times. </span>
<span sid='19250' title='19250'>If we insist that we are there by appointment I think he will hardly venture to contradict us. </span>
<span sid='19251' title='19251'>Have you the effrontery necessary to put it through?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19252' title='19252'>'We can but try.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19253' title='19253'>'Excellent, Watson! </span>
<span sid='19254' title='19254'>Compound of the Busy Bee and Excelsior. </span>
<span sid='19255' title='19255'>We can but try - the motto of the firm. </span>
<span sid='19256' title='19256'>A friendly native will surely guide us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19257' title='19257'>Such a one on the back of a smart hansom swept us past a row of ancient colleges, and finally turning into a treelined drive pulled up at the door of a charming house, girt round with lawns and covered with purple wistaria. </span>
<span sid='19258' title='19258'>Professor Presbury was certainly surrounded with every sign not only of comfort but of luxury. </span>
<span sid='19259' title='19259'>Even as we pulled up a grizzled head appeared at the front window, and we were aware of a pair of keen eyes from under shaggy brows which surveyed us through large horn glasses. </span>
<span sid='19260' title='19260'>A moment later we were actually in his sanctum, and the mysterious scientist, whose vagaries had brought us from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, was standing before us. </span>
<span sid='19261' title='19261'>There was certainly no sign of eccentricity either in his manner or appearance, for he was a portly, largefeatured man, grave, tall, and frock-coated, with the dignity of bearing which a lecturer needs. </span>
<span sid='19262' title='19262'>His eyes were his most remarkable feature, keen, observant, and clever to the verge of cunning.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19263' title='19263'>He looked at our cards. </span>
<span sid='19264' title='19264'>'Pray sit down, gentlemen. </span>
<span sid='19265' title='19265'>What can I do for you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19266' title='19266'>Mr Holmes smiled amiably.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19267' title='19267'>'It was the question which I was about to put to you, Professor.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19268' title='19268'>'To me, sir!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19269' title='19269'>'Possibly there is some mistake. </span>
<span sid='19270' title='19270'>I heard through a second person that Professor Presbury of Camford had need of my services.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19271' title='19271'>'Oh, indeed!' </span>
<span sid='19272' title='19272'>It seemed to me that there was a malicious sparkle in the intense grey eyes. </span>
<span sid='19273' title='19273'>'You heard that, did you? </span>
<span sid='19274' title='19274'>May I ask the name of your informant?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19275' title='19275'>'I am sorry, Professor, but the matter was rather confidential. </span>
<span sid='19276' title='19276'>If I have made a mistake there is no harm done. </span>
<span sid='19277' title='19277'>I can only express my regret.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19278' title='19278'>'Not at all. </span>
<span sid='19279' title='19279'>I should wish to go further into this matter. </span>
<span sid='19280' title='19280'>It interests me. </span>
<span sid='19281' title='19281'>Have you any scrap of writing, any letter or telegram, to bear out your assertion?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19282' title='19282'>'No, I have not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19283' title='19283'>'I presume that you do not go so far as to assert that I summoned you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19284' title='19284'>'I would rather answer no questions,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19285' title='19285'>'No, I dare say not,' said the Professor, with asperity. </span>
<span sid='19286' title='19286'>'However, that particular one can be answered very easily without your aid.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19287' title='19287'>He walked across the room to the bell. </span>
<span sid='19288' title='19288'>Our <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> friend, Mr Bennett, answered the call.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19289' title='19289'>'Come in, Mr Bennett. </span>
<span sid='19290' title='19290'>These two gentlemen have come from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> under the impression that they have been summoned. </span>
<span sid='19291' title='19291'>You handle all my correspondence. </span>
<span sid='19292' title='19292'>Have you a note of anything going to a person named Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19293' title='19293'>'No, sir,' Bennett answered, with a flush.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19294' title='19294'>'That is conclusive,' said the Professor, glaring angrily at my companion. </span>
<span sid='19295' title='19295'>'Now, sir' - he leaned forward with his two hands upon the table - 'it seems to me that your position is a very questionable one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19296' title='19296'>Holmes shrugged his shoulders.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19297' title='19297'>'I can only repeat that I am sorry that we have made a needless intrusion.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19298' title='19298'>'Hardly enough, Mr Holmes!' the old man cried, in a high screaming voice, with extraordinary malignancy upon his face. </span>
<span sid='19299' title='19299'>He got between us and the door as he spoke, and he shook his two hands at us with furious passion. </span>
<span sid='19300' title='19300'>'You can hardly get out of it so easily as that.' </span>
<span sid='19301' title='19301'>His face was convulsed and he grinned and gibbered at us in his senseless rage. </span>
<span sid='19302' title='19302'>I am convinced that we should have had to fight our way out of the room if Mr Bennett had not intervened.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19303' title='19303'>'My dear Professor,' he cried, 'consider your position! </span>
<span sid='19304' title='19304'>Consider the scandal at the University! </span>
<span sid='19305' title='19305'>Mr Holmes is a well-known man. </span>
<span sid='19306' title='19306'>You cannot possibly treat him with such discourtesy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19307' title='19307'>Sulkily our host - if I may call him so - cleared the path to the door. </span>
<span sid='19308' title='19308'>We were glad to find ourselves outside the house, and in the quiet of the tree-lined drive. </span>
<span sid='19309' title='19309'>Holmes seemed greatly amused by the episode.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19310' title='19310'>'Our learned friend's nerves are somewhat out of order,' said he. </span>
<span sid='19311' title='19311'>'Perhaps our intrusion was a little crude, and yet we have gained that personal contact which I desired. </span>
<span sid='19312' title='19312'>But, dear me, Watson, he is surely at our heels. </span>
<span sid='19313' title='19313'>The villain still pursues us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19314' title='19314'>There were the sounds of running feet behind, but it was, to my relief, not the formidable Professor but his assistant who appeared round the curve of the drive. </span>
<span sid='19315' title='19315'>He came panting up to us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19316' title='19316'>'I am so sorry, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='19317' title='19317'>I wished to apologize.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19318' title='19318'>'My dear sir, there is no need. </span>
<span sid='19319' title='19319'>It is all in the way of professional experience.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19320' title='19320'>'I have never seen him in a more dangerous mood. </span>
<span sid='19321' title='19321'>But he grows more sinister. </span>
<span sid='19322' title='19322'>You can understand now why his daughter and I are alarmed. </span>
<span sid='19323' title='19323'>And yet his mind is perfectly clear.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19324' title='19324'>'Too clear!' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='19325' title='19325'>'That was my miscalculation. </span>
<span sid='19326' title='19326'>It is evident that his memory is much more reliable than I had thought. </span>
<span sid='19327' title='19327'>By the way, can we, before we go, see the window of Miss Presbury's room?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19328' title='19328'>Mr Bennett pushed his way through some shrubs and we had a view of the side of the house.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19329' title='19329'>'It is there. </span>
<span sid='19330' title='19330'>The second on the left.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19331' title='19331'>'Dear me, it seems hardly accessible. </span>
<span sid='19332' title='19332'>And yet you will observe that there is a creeper below and a water-pipe above which give some foothold.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19333' title='19333'>'I could not climb it myself,' said Mr Bennett.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19334' title='19334'>'Very likely. </span>
<span sid='19335' title='19335'>It would certainly be a dangerous exploit for any normal man.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19336' title='19336'>'There was one other thing I wished to tell you, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='19337' title='19337'>I have the address of the man in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> to whom the Professor writes. </span>
<span sid='19338' title='19338'>He seems to have written this morning and I got it from his blotting-paper. </span>
<span sid='19339' title='19339'>It is an ignoble position for a trusted secretary, but what else can I do?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19340' title='19340'>Holmes glanced at the paper and put it into his pocket.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19341' title='19341'>'Dorak - a curious name. </span>
<span sid='19342' title='19342'>Slavonic, I imagine. </span>
<span sid='19343' title='19343'>Well, it is an important link in the chain. </span>
<span sid='19344' title='19344'>We return to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> this afternoon, Mr Bennett. </span>
<span sid='19345' title='19345'>I see no good purpose to be served by our remaining. </span>
<span sid='19346' title='19346'>We cannot arrest the Professor, because he has done no crime, nor can we place him under constraint, for he cannot be proved to be mad. </span>
<span sid='19347' title='19347'>No action is as yet possible.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19348' title='19348'>'Then what on earth are we to do?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19349' title='19349'>'A little patience, Mr Bennett. </span>
<span sid='19350' title='19350'>Things will soon develop. </span>
<span sid='19351' title='19351'>Unless I am mistaken next Tuesday may mark a crisis. </span>
<span sid='19352' title='19352'>Certainly we shall be in Camford on that day. </span>
<span sid='19353' title='19353'>Meanwhile, the general position is undeniably unpleasant, and if Miss Presbury can prolong her visit-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19354' title='19354'>'That is easy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19355' title='19355'>'Then let her stay till we can assure her that all danger is past. </span>
<span sid='19356' title='19356'>Meanwhile, let him have his way and do not cross him. </span>
<span sid='19357' title='19357'>So long as he is in a good humour all is well.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19358' title='19358'>'There he is!' said Bennett, in a startled whisper. </span>
<span sid='19359' title='19359'>Looking between the branches we saw the tall, erect figure emerge from the hall door and look around him. </span>
<span sid='19360' title='19360'>He stood leaning forward, his hands swinging straight before him, his head turning from side to side. </span>
<span sid='19361' title='19361'>The secretary with a last wave slipped off among the trees, and we saw him presently rejoin his employer, the two entering the house together in what seemed to be animated and even excited conversation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19362' title='19362'>'I expect the old gentleman has been putting two and two together,' said Holmes, as we walked hotelwards. </span>
<span sid='19363' title='19363'>'He struck me as having a particularly clear and logical brain, from the little I saw of him. </span>
<span sid='19364' title='19364'>Explosive, no doubt, but then from his point of view he has something to explode about if detectives are put on his track and he suspects his own household of doing it. </span>
<span sid='19365' title='19365'>I rather fancy that friend Bennett is in for an uncomfortable time.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19366' title='19366'>Holmes stopped at a post office and sent off a telegram on our way. </span>
<span sid='19367' title='19367'>The answer reached us in the evening, and he tossed it across to me. </span>
<span sid='19368' title='19368'>'Have visited the Commercial Road and seen Dorak. </span>
<span sid='19369' title='19369'>Suave person, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bohemia&t=h'>Bohemia</a>n, elderly. </span>
<span sid='19370' title='19370'>Keeps large general store. </span>
<span sid='19371' title='19371'>- Mercer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19372' title='19372'>'Mercer is since your time,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='19373' title='19373'>'He is my general utility man who looks up routine business. </span>
<span sid='19374' title='19374'>It was important to know something of the man with whom our Professor was so secretly corresponding. </span>
<span sid='19375' title='19375'>His nationality connects up with the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Prague&t=h'>Prague</a> visit.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19376' title='19376'>'Thank goodness that something connects with something,' said I. </span>
<span sid='19377' title='19377'>'At present we seem to be faced by a long series of inexplicable incidents with no bearing upon each other. </span>
<span sid='19378' title='19378'>For example what possible connection can there be between an angry wolf-hound and a visit to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bohemia&t=h'>Bohemia</a>, or either of them with a man crawling down a passage at night? </span>
<span sid='19379' title='19379'>As to your dates, that is the biggest mystification of all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19380' title='19380'>Holmes smiled and rubbed his hands. </span>
<span sid='19381' title='19381'>We were, I may say, seated in the old sitting-room of the ancient hotel, with a bottle of the famous vintage of which Holmes had spoken on the table between us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19382' title='19382'>'Well, now, let us take the dates first,' said he, his fingertips together and his manner as if he were addressing a class. </span>
<span sid='19383' title='19383'>'This excellent young man's diary shows that there was trouble upon July 2nd, and from then onwards it seems to have been at nine-day intervals, with, so far as I remember, only one exception. </span>
<span sid='19384' title='19384'>Thus the last outbreak upon Friday was on September 3rd, which also falls into the series, as did August 25th, which preceded it. </span>
<span sid='19385' title='19385'>The thing is beyond coincidence.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19386' title='19386'>I was forced to agree.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19387' title='19387'>'Let us, then, form the provisional theory that every nine days the Professor takes some strong drug which has a passing but highly poisonous effect. </span>
<span sid='19388' title='19388'>His naturally violent nature is intensified by it. </span>
<span sid='19389' title='19389'>He learned to take this drug while he was in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Prague&t=h'>Prague</a>, and is now supplied with it by a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bohemia&t=h'>Bohemia</a>n intermediary in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='19390' title='19390'>This all hangs together, Watson!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19391' title='19391'>'But the dog, the face at the window, the creeping man in the passage?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19392' title='19392'>'Well, well, we have made a beginning. </span>
<span sid='19393' title='19393'>I should not expect any fresh developments until next Tuesday. </span>
<span sid='19394' title='19394'>In the meantime we can only keep in touch with friend Bennett and enjoy the amenities of this charming town.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19395' title='19395'>In the morning Mr Bennett slipped round to bring us the latest report. </span>
<span sid='19396' title='19396'>As Holmes had imagined, times had not been easy with him. </span>
<span sid='19397' title='19397'>Without exactly accusing him of being responsible for our presence, the Professor had been very rough and rude in his speech, and evidently felt some strong grievance. </span>
<span sid='19398' title='19398'>This morning he was quite himself again, however, and had delivered his usual brilliant lecture to a crowded class. </span>
<span sid='19399' title='19399'>'Apart from his queer fits,' said Bennett, 'he has actually more energy and vitality than I can ever remember, nor was his brain ever clearer. </span>
<span sid='19400' title='19400'>But it's not he - it's never the man whom we have known.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19401' title='19401'>'I don't think you have anything to fear now for a week at least,' Holmes answered. </span>
<span sid='19402' title='19402'>'I am a busy man, and Dr Watson has his patients to attend to. </span>
<span sid='19403' title='19403'>Let us agree that we meet here at this hour next Tuesday, and I shall be surprised if before we leave you again we are not able to explain, even if we cannot perhaps put an end to, your troubles. </span>
<span sid='19404' title='19404'>Meanwhile, keep us posted in what occurs.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19405' title='19405'>I saw nothing of my friend for the next few days, but on the following Monday evening I had a short note asking me to meet him next day at the train. </span>
<span sid='19406' title='19406'>From what he told me as we travelled up to Camford all was well, the peace of the Professor's house had been unruffled, and his own conduct perfectly normal. </span>
<span sid='19407' title='19407'>This also was the report which was given us by Mr Bennett himself when he called upon us that evening at our old quarters in the 'Chequers'. </span>
<span sid='19408' title='19408'>'He heard from his <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> correspondent today. </span>
<span sid='19409' title='19409'>There was a letter and there was a small packet, each with the cross under the stamp which warned me not to touch them. </span>
<span sid='19410' title='19410'>There has been nothing else.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19411' title='19411'>'That may prove quite enough,' said Holmes, grimly. </span>
<span sid='19412' title='19412'>'Now, Mr Bennett, we shall, I think, come to some conclusion tonight. </span>
<span sid='19413' title='19413'>If my deductions are correct we should have an opportunity of bringing matters to a head. </span>
<span sid='19414' title='19414'>In order to do so it is necessary to hold the Professor under observation. </span>
<span sid='19415' title='19415'>I would suggest, therefore, that you remain awake and on the look-out. </span>
<span sid='19416' title='19416'>Should you hear him pass your door do not interrupt him, but follow him as discreetly as you can. </span>
<span sid='19417' title='19417'>Dr Watson and I will not be far off. </span>
<span sid='19418' title='19418'>By the way, where is the key of that little box of which you spoke?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19419' title='19419'>'Upon his watch-chain.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19420' title='19420'>'I fancy our researches must lie in that direction. </span>
<span sid='19421' title='19421'>At the worst the lock should not be very formidable. </span>
<span sid='19422' title='19422'>Have you any other able-bodied man on the premises?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19423' title='19423'>'There is the coachman, Macphail.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19424' title='19424'>'Where does he sleep?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19425' title='19425'>'Over the stables.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19426' title='19426'>'We might possibly want him. </span>
<span sid='19427' title='19427'>Well, we can do no more until we see how things develop. </span>
<span sid='19428' title='19428'>Good-bye - but I expect that we shall see you before morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19429' title='19429'>It was nearly midnight before we took our station among some bushes immediately opposite the hall door of the Professor. </span>
<span sid='19430' title='19430'>It was a fine night, but chilly, and we were glad of our warm overcoats. </span>
<span sid='19431' title='19431'>There was a breeze, and clouds were scudding across the sky, obscuring from time to time the half-moon. </span>
<span sid='19432' title='19432'>It would have been a dismal vigil were it not for the expectation and excitement which carried us along, and the assurance of my comrade that we had probably reached the end of the strange sequence of events which had engaged our attention.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19433' title='19433'>'If the cycle of nine days holds good then we shall have the Professor at his worst tonight,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='19434' title='19434'>'The fact that these strange symptoms began after his visit to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Prague&t=h'>Prague</a>, that he is in secret correspondence with a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bohemia&t=h'>Bohemia</a>n dealer in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, who presumably represents someone in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Prague&t=h'>Prague</a>, and that he received a packet from him this very day, all point in one direction. </span>
<span sid='19435' title='19435'>What he takes and why he takes it are still beyond our ken, but that it emanates in some way from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Prague&t=h'>Prague</a> is clear enough. </span>
<span sid='19436' title='19436'>He takes it under definite directions which regulate this ninth-day system, which was the first point which attracted my attention. </span>
<span sid='19437' title='19437'>But his symptoms are most remarkable. </span>
<span sid='19438' title='19438'>Did you observe his knuckles?' </span>
<span sid='19439' title='19439'>I had to confess that I did not.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19440' title='19440'>'Thick and horny in a way which is quite new in my experience. </span>
<span sid='19441' title='19441'>Always look at the hands first, Watson. </span>
<span sid='19442' title='19442'>Then cuffs, trouser-knees, and boots. </span>
<span sid='19443' title='19443'>Very curious knuckles which can only be explained by the mode of progression observed by-' Holmes paused, and suddenly clapped his hand to his forehead. </span>
<span sid='19444' title='19444'>'Oh, Watson, Watson, what a fool I have been! </span>
<span sid='19445' title='19445'>It seems incredible, and yet it must be true. </span>
<span sid='19446' title='19446'>All points in one direction. </span>
<span sid='19447' title='19447'>How could I miss seeing the connection of ideas? </span>
<span sid='19448' title='19448'>Those knuckles - how could I have passed those knuckles? </span>
<span sid='19449' title='19449'>And the dog! </span>
<span sid='19450' title='19450'>And the ivy! </span>
<span sid='19451' title='19451'>It's surely time that I disappeared into that little farm of my dreams. </span>
<span sid='19452' title='19452'>Look out, Watson! </span>
<span sid='19453' title='19453'>Here he is! </span>
<span sid='19454' title='19454'>We shall have the chance of seeing for ourselves.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19455' title='19455'>The hall door had slowly opened, and against the lamp-lit background we saw the tall figure of Professor Presbury. </span>
<span sid='19456' title='19456'>He was clad in his dressing-gown. </span>
<span sid='19457' title='19457'>As he stood outlined in the doorway he was erect but leaning forward with dangling arms, as when we saw him last.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19458' title='19458'>Now he stepped forward into the drive, and an extraordinary change came over him. </span>
<span sid='19459' title='19459'>He sank down into a crouching position, and moved along upon his hands and feet, skipping every now and then as if he were overflowing with energy and vitality. </span>
<span sid='19460' title='19460'>He moved along the face of the house and then round the corner. </span>
<span sid='19461' title='19461'>As he disappeared Bennett slipped through the hall door and softly followed him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19462' title='19462'>'Come, Watson, come!' cried Holmes, and we stole as softly as we could through the bushes until we had gained a spot whence we could see the other side of the house, which was bathed in the light of the half-moon. </span>
<span sid='19463' title='19463'>The Professor was clearly visible crouching at the foot of the ivy-covered wall. </span>
<span sid='19464' title='19464'>As we watched him he suddenly began with incredible agility to ascend it. </span>
<span sid='19465' title='19465'>From branch to branch he sprang, sure of foot and firm of grasp, climbing apparently in mere joy at his own powers, with no definite object in view. </span>
<span sid='19466' title='19466'>With his dressing-gown flapping on each side of him he looked like some huge bat glued against the side of his own house, a great square dark patch upon the moonlit wall. </span>
<span sid='19467' title='19467'>Presently he tired of this amusement, and dropping from branch to branch, he squatted down into the old attitude and moved towards the stables, creeping along in the same strange way as before. </span>
<span sid='19468' title='19468'>The wolf-hound was out now, barking furiously, and more excited than ever when it actually caught sight of its master. </span>
<span sid='19469' title='19469'>It was straining on its chain, and quivering with eagerness and rage. </span>
<span sid='19470' title='19470'>The Professor squatted down very deliberately just out of reach of the hound, and began to provoke it in every possible way. </span>
<span sid='19471' title='19471'>He took handfuls of pebbles from the drive and threw them in the dog's face, prodded him with a stick which he had picked up, flicked his hands about only a few inches from the gaping mouth, and endeavoured in every way to increase the animal's fury, which was already beyond all control. </span>
<span sid='19472' title='19472'>In all our adventures I do not know that I have ever seen a more strange sight than this impassive and still dignified figure crouching froglike upon the ground and goading to a wilder exhibition of passion the maddened hound, which ramped and raged in front of him, by all manner of ingenious and calculated cruelty.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19473' title='19473'>And then in a moment it happened! </span>
<span sid='19474' title='19474'>It was not the chain that broke, but it was the collar that slipped, for it had been made for a thick-necked <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Newfoundland&t=h'>Newfoundland</a>. </span>
<span sid='19475' title='19475'>We heard the rattle of falling metal, and the next instant dog and man were rolling on the ground together, the one roaring in rage, the other screaming in a strange shrill falsetto of terror. </span>
<span sid='19476' title='19476'>It was a very narrow thing for the Professor's life. </span>
<span sid='19477' title='19477'>The savage creature had him fairly by the throat, its fangs had bitten deep, and he was senseless before we could reach them and drag the two apart. </span>
<span sid='19478' title='19478'>It might have been a dangerous task for us, but Bennett's voice and presence brought the great wolfhound instantly to reason. </span>
<span sid='19479' title='19479'>The uproar had brought the sleepy and astonished coachman from his room above the stables. </span>
<span sid='19480' title='19480'>'I'm not surprised,' said he, shaking his head. </span>
<span sid='19481' title='19481'>'I've seen him at it before. </span>
<span sid='19482' title='19482'>I knew the dog would get him sooner or later.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19483' title='19483'>The hound was secured, and together we carried the Professor up to his room, where Bennett, who had a medical degree, helped me to dress his torn throat. </span>
<span sid='19484' title='19484'>The sharp teeth had passed dangerously near the carotid artery, and the haemorrhage was serious. </span>
<span sid='19485' title='19485'>In half an hour the danger was past, I had given the patient an injection of morphia, and he had sunk into deep sleep. </span>
<span sid='19486' title='19486'>Then, and only then, were we able to look at each other and to take stock of the situation. </span>
<span sid='19487' title='19487'>'I think a first-class surgeon should see him,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19488' title='19488'>'For God's sake, no!' cried Bennett. </span>
<span sid='19489' title='19489'>'At present the scandal is confined to our own household. </span>
<span sid='19490' title='19490'>It is safe with us. </span>
<span sid='19491' title='19491'>If it gets beyond these walls it will never stop. </span>
<span sid='19492' title='19492'>Consider his position at the University, his <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>an reputation, the feelings of his daughter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19493' title='19493'>'Quite so,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='19494' title='19494'>'I think it may be quite possible to keep the matter to ourselves, and also to prevent its recurrence now that we have a free hand. </span>
<span sid='19495' title='19495'>The key from the watch-chain, Mr Bennett. </span>
<span sid='19496' title='19496'>Macphail will guard the patient and let us know if there is any change. </span>
<span sid='19497' title='19497'>Let us see what we can find in the Professor's mysterious box.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19498' title='19498'>There was not much, but there was enough - an empty phial, another nearly full, a hypodermic syringe, several letters in a crabbed, foreign hand. </span>
<span sid='19499' title='19499'>The marks on the envelopes showed that they were those which had disturbed the routine of the secretary, and each was dated from the Commercial Road and signed ' A. Dorak'. </span>
<span sid='19500' title='19500'>They were mere invoices to say that a fresh bottle was being sent to Professor Presbury, or receipts to acknowledge money. </span>
<span sid='19501' title='19501'>There was one other envelope, however, in a more educated hand and bearing the Austrian stamp with the postmark of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Prague&t=h'>Prague</a>. </span>
<span sid='19502' title='19502'>'Here we have our material!' cried Holmes, as he tore out the enclosure.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19503' title='19503'>HONOURED COLLEAGUE, </span>
<span sid='19504' title='19504'>[it ran] Since your esteemed visit I have thought much of your case, and though in your circumstances there are some special reasons for the treatment, I would none the less enjoin caution, as my results have shown that it is not without danger of a kind. </span>
<span sid='19505' title='19505'>It is possible that the serum of Anthropoid would have been better. </span>
<span sid='19506' title='19506'>I have, as I explained to you, used black-faced Langur because a specimen was accessible. </span>
<span sid='19507' title='19507'>Langur is, of course, a crawler and climber, while Anthropoid walks erect, and is in all ways nearer. </span>
<span sid='19508' title='19508'>I beg you to take every possible precaution that there be no premature revelation of the process. </span>
<span sid='19509' title='19509'>I have one other client in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, and Dorak is my agent for both. </span>
<span sid='19510' title='19510'>Weekly reports will oblige. </span>
<span sid='19511' title='19511'>Yours with high esteem, </span>
<span sid='19512' title='19512'>H. LOWENSTEIN</span>
<p>
<span sid='19513' title='19513'>Lowenstein! </span>
<span sid='19514' title='19514'>The name brought back to me the memory of some snippet from a newspaper which spoke of an obscure scientist who was striving in some unknown way for the secret of rejuvenescence and the elixir of life. </span>
<span sid='19515' title='19515'>Lowenstein of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Prague&t=h'>Prague</a>! </span>
<span sid='19516' title='19516'>Lowenstein with the wondrous strengthgiving serum, tabooed by the profession because he refused to reveal its source. </span>
<span sid='19517' title='19517'>In a few words I said what I remembered. </span>
<span sid='19518' title='19518'>Bennett had taken a manual of zoology from the shelves. </span>
<span sid='19519' title='19519'>'"Langur",' he read, '"the great black-faced monkey of the Himalayan slopes, biggest and most human of climbing monkeys." </span>
<span sid='19520' title='19520'>Many details are added. </span>
<span sid='19521' title='19521'>Well, thanks to you, Mr Holmes, it is very clear that we have traced the evil to its source.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19522' title='19522'>'The real source,' said Holmes, 'lies, of course, in that untimely love affair which gave our impetuous Professor the idea that he could only gain his wish by turning himself into a younger man. </span>
<span sid='19523' title='19523'>When one tries to rise above Nature one is liable to fall below it. </span>
<span sid='19524' title='19524'>The highest type of man may revert to the animal if he leaves the straight road of destiny.' </span>
<span sid='19525' title='19525'>He sat musing for a little with the phial in his hand, looking at the clear liquid within. </span>
<span sid='19526' title='19526'>'When I have written to this man and told him that I hold him criminally responsible for the poisons which he circulates, we will have no more trouble. </span>
<span sid='19527' title='19527'>But it may recur. </span>
<span sid='19528' title='19528'>Others may find a better way. </span>
<span sid='19529' title='19529'>There is danger there - a very real danger to humanity. </span>
<span sid='19530' title='19530'>Consider, Watson, that the material, the sensual, the worldly would all prolong their worthless lives. </span>
<span sid='19531' title='19531'>The spiritual would not avoid the call to something higher. </span>
<span sid='19532' title='19532'>It would be the survival of the least fit. </span>
<span sid='19533' title='19533'>What sort of cesspool may not our poor world become?' </span>
<span sid='19534' title='19534'>Suddenly the dreamer disappeared, and Holmes, the man of action, sprang from his chair. </span>
<span sid='19535' title='19535'>'I think there is nothing more to be said, Mr Bennett. </span>
<span sid='19536' title='19536'>The various incidents will now fit themselves easily into the general scheme. </span>
<span sid='19537' title='19537'>The dog, of course, was aware of the change far more quickly than you. </span>
<span sid='19538' title='19538'>His smell would ensure that. </span>
<span sid='19539' title='19539'>It was the monkey, not the Professor, whom Roy attacked, just as it was the monkey who teased Roy. </span>
<span sid='19540' title='19540'>Climbing was a joy to the creature, and it was a mere chance, I take it, that the pastime brought him to the young lady's window. </span>
<span sid='19541' title='19541'>There is an early train to town, Watson, but I think we shall just have time for a cup of tea at the "Chequers" before we catch it.'</span>
