<h1><span sid='53428' title='53428'>The Adventure of the Resident Patient</span></h1>
<p class="subtitle">Arthur Conan Doyle<label for="sn-meta-resi" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-meta-resi" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><!--googleoff: all--><b>Story Number</b>: 23<br><b>Published in</b>: The Strand Magazine in August 1893<br><b>Collected in</b>: The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes<!--googleon: all--></span></p>
<p>
<span sid='53429' title='53429'>In glancing over the somewhat incoherent series of memoirs with which I have endeavoured to illustrate a few of the mental peculiarities of my friend, Mr Sherlock Holmes, I have been struck by the difficulty which I have experienced in picking out examples which shall in every way answer my purpose. </span>
<span sid='53430' title='53430'>For in those cases in which Holmes has performed some tour-de-force of analytical reasoning, and has demonstrated the value of his peculiar methods of investigation, the facts themselves have often been so slight or so commonplace that I could not feel justified in laying them before the public. </span>
<span sid='53431' title='53431'>On the other hand, it has frequently happened that he has been concerned in some research where the facts have been of the most remarkable and dramatic character, but where the share which he has himself taken in determining their causes has been less pronounced than I, as his biographer, could wish. </span>
<span sid='53432' title='53432'>The small matter which I have chronicled under the heading of 'A Study in Scarlet,' and that other later one connected with the loss of the Gloria Scott, may serve as examples of this Scylla and Charybdis which are for ever threatening his historian. </span>
<span sid='53433' title='53433'>It may be that, in the business of which I am now about to write, the part which my friend played is not sufficiently accentuated; and yet the whole train of circumstances is so remarkable that I cannot bring myself to omit it entirely from this series.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53434' title='53434'>I cannot be sure of the exact date, for some of my memoranda upon the matter have been mislaid, but it must have been towards the end of the first year during which Holmes and I shared chambers in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='53435' title='53435'>It was boisterous October weather, and we had both remained indoors all day, I because I feared with my shaken health to face the keen autumn wind, while he was deep in some of those abstruse chemical investigations which absorbed him utterly as long as he was engaged upon them. </span>
<span sid='53436' title='53436'>Towards evening, however, the breaking of a test-tube brought his research to a premature ending, and he sprang up from his chair with an exclamation of impatience and a clouded brow.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53437' title='53437'>'A day's work ruined, Watson,' said he, striding across to the window. </span>
<span sid='53438' title='53438'>'Ha! the stars are out and the wind has fallen. </span>
<span sid='53439' title='53439'>What do you say to a ramble through <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53440' title='53440'>I was weary of our little sitting-room, and gladly acquiesced, muffling myself nose-high against the keen night air. </span>
<span sid='53441' title='53441'>For three hours we strolled about together, watching the ever-changing kaleidoscope of life as it ebbs and flows through <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Fleet Street&t=h'>Fleet Street</a> and <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Strand&t=h'>the Strand</a>. </span>
<span sid='53442' title='53442'>Holmes had shaken off his temporary ill-humour, and his characteristic talk, with its keen observance of detail and subtle power of inference, held me amused and enthralled. </span>
<span sid='53443' title='53443'>It was ten o'clock before we reached <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> again. </span>
<span sid='53444' title='53444'>A brougham was waiting at our door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53445' title='53445'>'Hum! </span>
<span sid='53446' title='53446'>A doctor's - general practitioner, I perceive,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='53447' title='53447'>'Not been long in practice, or had much to do. </span>
<span sid='53448' title='53448'>Come to consult us, I fancy! </span>
<span sid='53449' title='53449'>Lucky we came back!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53450' title='53450'>I was sufficiently conversant with Holmes's methods to be able to follow his reasoning, and to see that the nature and state of the various medical instruments in the wicker basket which hung in the lamp-light inside the brougham had given him the data for his swift deduction. </span>
<span sid='53451' title='53451'>The light in our window above showed that this late visit was indeed intended for us. </span>
<span sid='53452' title='53452'>With some curiosity as to what could have sent a brother medico to us at such an hour, I followed Holmes into our sanctum.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53453' title='53453'>A pale, taper-faced man with sandy whiskers rose up from a chair by the fire as we entered. </span>
<span sid='53454' title='53454'>His age may not have been more than three or four and thirty, but his haggard expression and unhealthy hue told of a life which had sapped his strength and robbed him of his youth. </span>
<span sid='53455' title='53455'>His manner was nervous and shy, like that of a sensitive gentleman, and the thin white hand which he laid on the mantelpiece as he rose was that of an artist rather than of a surgeon. </span>
<span sid='53456' title='53456'>His dress was quiet and sombre, a black frock-coat, dark trousers, and a touch of colour about his necktie.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53457' title='53457'>'Good evening, Doctor,' said Holmes, cheerily; 'I am glad to see that you have only been waiting a very few minutes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53458' title='53458'>'You spoke to my coachman, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53459' title='53459'>'No, it was the candle on the side-table that told me. </span>
<span sid='53460' title='53460'>Pray resume your seat and let me know how I can serve you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53461' title='53461'>'My name is Doctor Percy Trevelyan,' said our visitor, 'and I live at 403, Brook Street.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53462' title='53462'>'Are you not the author of a monograph upon obscure nervous lesions?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53463' title='53463'>His pale cheeks flushed with pleasure at hearing that his work was known to me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53464' title='53464'>'I so seldom hear of the work that I thought it was quite dead,' said he. </span>
<span sid='53465' title='53465'>'My publishers give me a most discouraging account of its sale. </span>
<span sid='53466' title='53466'>You are yourself, I presume, a medical man?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53467' title='53467'>'A retired Army surgeon.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53468' title='53468'>'My own hobby has always been nervous disease. </span>
<span sid='53469' title='53469'>I should wish to make it an absolute specialty, but, of course, a man must take what he can get at first. </span>
<span sid='53470' title='53470'>This, however, is beside the question, Mr Sherlock Holmes, and I quite appreciate how valuable your time is. </span>
<span sid='53471' title='53471'>The fact is that a very singular train of events has occurred recently at my house in Brook Street, and to-night they came to such a head that I felt it was quite impossible for me to wait another hour before asking for your advice and assistance.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53472' title='53472'>Sherlock Holmes sat down and lit his pipe. </span>
<span sid='53473' title='53473'>'You are very welcome to both,' said he. </span>
<span sid='53474' title='53474'>'Pray let me have a detailed account of what the circumstances are which have disturbed you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53475' title='53475'>'One or two of them are so trivial,' said Dr Trevelyan, 'that really I am almost ashamed to mention them. </span>
<span sid='53476' title='53476'>But the matter is so inexplicable, and the recent turn which it has taken is so elaborate, that I shall lay it all before you, and you shall judge what is essential and what is not.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53477' title='53477'>'I am compelled, to begin with, to say something of my own college career. </span>
<span sid='53478' title='53478'>I am a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> University man, you know, and I am sure you will not think that I am unduly singing my own praises if I say that my student career was considered by my professors to be a very promising one. </span>
<span sid='53479' title='53479'>After I had graduated I continued to devote myself to research, occupying a minor position in King's College Hospital, and I was fortunate enough to excite considerable interest by my research into the pathology of catalepsy, and finally to win the Bruce Pinkerton prize and medal by the monograph on nervous lesions to which your friend has just alluded. </span>
<span sid='53480' title='53480'>I should not go too far if I were to say that there was a general impression at that time that a distinguished career lay before me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53481' title='53481'>'But the one great stumbling-block lay in my want of capital. </span>
<span sid='53482' title='53482'>As you will readily understand, a specialist who aims high is compelled to start in one of a dozen streets in the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Cavendish Square&t=h'>Cavendish Square</a> quarter, all of which entail enormous rents and furnishing expenses. </span>
<span sid='53483' title='53483'>Besides this preliminary outlay, he must be prepared to keep himself for some years, and to hire a presentable carriage and horse. </span>
<span sid='53484' title='53484'>To do this was quite beyond my power, and I could only hope that by economy I might in ten years' time save enough to enable me to put up my plate. </span>
<span sid='53485' title='53485'>Suddenly, however, an unexpected incident opened up quite a new prospect to me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53486' title='53486'>'This was a visit from a gentleman of the name of Blessington, who was a complete stranger to me. </span>
<span sid='53487' title='53487'>He came up into my room one morning, and plunged into business in an instant.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53488' title='53488'>'"You are the same Percy Trevelyan who has had so distinguished a career and won a great prize lately?' said he. I bowed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53489' title='53489'>'"Answer me frankly," he continued, "for you will find it to your interest to do so. </span>
<span sid='53490' title='53490'>You have all the cleverness which makes a successful man. </span>
<span sid='53491' title='53491'>Have you the tact?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='53492' title='53492'>'I could not help smiling at the abruptness of the question.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53493' title='53493'>'"I trust that I have my share," I said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53494' title='53494'>'"Any bad habits? </span>
<span sid='53495' title='53495'>Not drawn towards drink, eh?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='53496' title='53496'>'"Really, sir!" I cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53497' title='53497'>'"Quite right! </span>
<span sid='53498' title='53498'>That's all right! </span>
<span sid='53499' title='53499'>But I was bound to ask. </span>
<span sid='53500' title='53500'>With all these qualities why are you not in practice?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='53501' title='53501'>'I shrugged my shoulders.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53502' title='53502'>'"Come, come!" said he, in his bustling way. </span>
<span sid='53503' title='53503'>"It's the old story. </span>
<span sid='53504' title='53504'>More in your brains than in your pocket, eh? </span>
<span sid='53505' title='53505'>What would you say if I were to start you in Brook Street?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='53506' title='53506'>'I stared at him in astonishment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53507' title='53507'>'"Oh, it's for my sake, not for yours," he cried. </span>
<span sid='53508' title='53508'>"I'll be perfectly frank with you, and if it suits you it will suit me very well. </span>
<span sid='53509' title='53509'>I have a few thousands to invest, d'ye see, and I think I'll sink them in you."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53510' title='53510'>'"But why?" I gasped.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53511' title='53511'>'"Well, it's just like any other speculation, and safer than most."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53512' title='53512'>'"What am I to do, then?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='53513' title='53513'>'"I'll tell you. </span>
<span sid='53514' title='53514'>I'll take the house, furnish it, pay the maids, and run the whole place. </span>
<span sid='53515' title='53515'>All you have to do is just to wear out your chair in the consulting-room. </span>
<span sid='53516' title='53516'>I'll let you have pocket-money and everything. </span>
<span sid='53517' title='53517'>Then you hand over to me three-quarters of what you earn and you keep the other quarter for yourself."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53518' title='53518'>'This was the strange proposal, Mr Holmes, with which the man Blessington approached me. </span>
<span sid='53519' title='53519'>I won't weary you with the account of how we bargained and negotiated. </span>
<span sid='53520' title='53520'>It ended in my moving into the house next Lady Day and starting in practice on very much the same conditions as he had suggested. </span>
<span sid='53521' title='53521'>He came himself to live 'with me in the character of a resident patient. </span>
<span sid='53522' title='53522'>His heart was weak, it appears, and he needed constant medical supervision. </span>
<span sid='53523' title='53523'>He turned the two best rooms on the first floor into a sitting-room and bedroom for himself. </span>
<span sid='53524' title='53524'>He was a man of singular habits, shunning company and very seldom going out. </span>
<span sid='53525' title='53525'>His life was irregular, but in one respect he was regularity itself. </span>
<span sid='53526' title='53526'>Every evening at the same hour he walked into the consulting-room, examined the books, put down five and threepence for every guinea that I had earned, and carried the rest off to the strong box in his own room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53527' title='53527'>'I may say with confidence that he never had occasion to regret his speculation. </span>
<span sid='53528' title='53528'>From the first it was a success. </span>
<span sid='53529' title='53529'>A few good cases and the reputation which I had won in the hospital brought me rapidly to the front, and during the last few years I have made him a rich man.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53530' title='53530'>'So much, Mr Holmes, for my past history and for my relations with Mr Blessington. </span>
<span sid='53531' title='53531'>It only remains for me now to tell you what has occurred to bring me here to-night.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53532' title='53532'>'Some weeks ago Mr Blessington came down to me in, as it seemed to me, a state of considerable agitation. </span>
<span sid='53533' title='53533'>He spoke of some burglary which, he said, had been committed in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the West&t=h'>the West</a>-end, and he appeared, I remember, to be quite unnecessarily excited about it, declaring that a day should not pass before we should add stronger bolts to our windows and doors. </span>
<span sid='53534' title='53534'>For a week he continued to be in quite a peculiar state of restlessness, peering continually out of the windows, and ceasing to take the short walk which had usually been the prelude to his dinner. </span>
<span sid='53535' title='53535'>From his manner it struck me that he was in mortal dread of something or somebody, but when I questioned him upon the point he became so offensive that I was compelled to drop the subject. </span>
<span sid='53536' title='53536'>Gradually as time passed his fears appeared to die away, and he had renewed his former habits, when a fresh event reduced him to the pitiable state of prostration in which he now lies.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53537' title='53537'>'What happened was this. </span>
<span sid='53538' title='53538'>Two days ago I received the letter which I now read to you. </span>
<span sid='53539' title='53539'>Neither address nor date is attached to it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53540' title='53540'>'"A <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Russia&t=h'>Russia</a>n nobleman who is now resident in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>," it runs, "would be glad to avail himself of the professional assistance of Dr Percy Trevelyan. </span>
<span sid='53541' title='53541'>He has been for some years a victim to cataleptic attacks, on which, as is well known, Dr Trevelyan is an authority. </span>
<span sid='53542' title='53542'>He proposes to call at about a quarter-past six tomorrow evening, if Dr Trevelyan will make it convenient to be at home."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53543' title='53543'>'This letter interested me deeply, because the chief difficulty in the study of catalepsy is the rareness of the disease. </span>
<span sid='53544' title='53544'>You may believe, then, that I was in my consulting-room when, at the appointed hour, the page showed in the patient.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53545' title='53545'>'He was an elderly man, thin, demure, and commonplace-by no means the conception one forms of a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Russia&t=h'>Russia</a>n nobleman. </span>
<span sid='53546' title='53546'>I was much more struck by the appearance of his companion. </span>
<span sid='53547' title='53547'>This was a tall young man, surprisingly handsome, with a dark, fierce face, and the limbs and chest of a Hercules. </span>
<span sid='53548' title='53548'>He had his hand under the other's arm as they entered, and helped him to a chair with a tenderness which one would hardly have expected from his appearance.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53549' title='53549'>'"You will excuse my coming in, Doctor," said he to me, speaking English with a slight lisp. </span>
<span sid='53550' title='53550'>'This is my father, and his health is a matter of the most overwhelming importance to me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53551' title='53551'>'I was touched by this filial anxiety. </span>
<span sid='53552' title='53552'>"You would, perhaps, care to remain during the consultation," said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53553' title='53553'>'"Not for the world," he cried, with a gesture of horror. </span>
<span sid='53554' title='53554'>"It is more painful to me than I can express. </span>
<span sid='53555' title='53555'>If I were to see my father in one of those dreadful seizures, I am convinced that I should never survive it. </span>
<span sid='53556' title='53556'>My own nervous system is an exceptionally sensitive one. </span>
<span sid='53557' title='53557'>With your permission I will remain in the waiting-room while you go into my father's case.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53558' title='53558'>'To this, of course, I assented, and the young man withdrew. </span>
<span sid='53559' title='53559'>The patient and I then plunged into a discussion of his case, of which I took exhaustive notes. </span>
<span sid='53560' title='53560'>He was not remarkable for intelligence, and his answers were frequently obscure, which I attributed to his limited acquaintance with our language. </span>
<span sid='53561' title='53561'>Suddenly, however, as I sat writing he ceased to give any answer at all to my inquiries, and on my turning towards him I was shocked to see that he was sitting bolt upright in his chair, staring at me with a perfectly blank and rigid face. </span>
<span sid='53562' title='53562'>He was again in the grip of his mysterious malady.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53563' title='53563'>'My first feeling, as I have just said, was one of pity and horror. </span>
<span sid='53564' title='53564'>My second, I fear, was rather one of professional satisfaction. </span>
<span sid='53565' title='53565'>I made notes of my patient's pulse and temperature, tested the rigidity of his muscles, and examined his reflexes. </span>
<span sid='53566' title='53566'>There was nothing markedly abnormal in any of these conditions, which harmonized with my former experiences. </span>
<span sid='53567' title='53567'>I had obtained good results in such cases by the inhalation of nitrite of amyl, and the present seemed an admirable opportunity of testing its virtues. </span>
<span sid='53568' title='53568'>The bottle was downstairs in my laboratory, so, leaving my patient seated in his chair, I ran down to get it. </span>
<span sid='53569' title='53569'>There was some little delay in finding it - five minutes, let us say - and then I returned. </span>
<span sid='53570' title='53570'>Imagine my amazement to find the room empty and the patient gone!</span>
<p>
<span sid='53571' title='53571'>'Of course, my first act was to run into the waiting-room. </span>
<span sid='53572' title='53572'>The son had gone also. </span>
<span sid='53573' title='53573'>The hall door had been closed, but not shut. </span>
<span sid='53574' title='53574'>My page who admits patients is a new boy, and by no means quick. </span>
<span sid='53575' title='53575'>He waits downstairs, and runs up to show patients out when I ring the consulting-room bell. </span>
<span sid='53576' title='53576'>He had heard nothing, and the affair remained a complete mystery. </span>
<span sid='53577' title='53577'>Mr Blessington came in from his walk shortly afterwards, but I did not say anything to him upon the subject, for, to tell the truth, I have got in the way of late of holding as little communication with him as possible.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53578' title='53578'>'Well, I, never thought that I should see anything more of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Russia&t=h'>Russia</a>n and his son, so you can imagine my amazement when at the very same hour this evening they both came marching into my consulting-room, just as they had done before.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53579' title='53579'>'"I feel that I owe you a great many apologies for my abrupt departure yesterday, Doctor," said my patient.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53580' title='53580'>'"I confess that I was very much surprised at it," said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53581' title='53581'>'"Well, the fact is," he remarked, "that when I recover from these attacks my mind is always very clouded as to all that has gone before. </span>
<span sid='53582' title='53582'>I woke up in a strange room, as it seemed to me, and made my way out into the street in a sort of dazed way when you were absent.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53583' title='53583'>'"And I," said the son, "seeing my father pass the door of the waiting-room, naturally thought that the consultation had come to an end. </span>
<span sid='53584' title='53584'>It was not until we had reached home that I began to realize the true state of affairs."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53585' title='53585'>'"Well," said I, laughing, "there is no harm done, except that you puzzled me terribly; so if you, sir, would kindly step into the waiting-room, I shall be happy to continue our consultation, which was brought to so abrupt an ending."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53586' title='53586'>'For half an hour or so I discussed the old gentleman's symptoms with him, and then, having prescribed for him, I saw him go off on the arm of his son.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53587' title='53587'>'I have told you that Mr Blessington generally chose this hour of the day for his exercise. </span>
<span sid='53588' title='53588'>He came in shortly afterwards and passed upstairs. </span>
<span sid='53589' title='53589'>An instant later I heard him running down, and he burst into my consulting-room like a man who is mad with panic.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53590' title='53590'>'"Who has been in my room?" he cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53591' title='53591'>'"No one," said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53592' title='53592'>'"It's a lie!" he yelled. </span>
<span sid='53593' title='53593'>"Come up and look."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53594' title='53594'>'I passed over the grossness of his language, as he seemed half out of his mind with fear. </span>
<span sid='53595' title='53595'>When I went upstairs with him he pointed to several footprints upon the light carpet.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53596' title='53596'>'"D'you mean to say those are mine?" he cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53597' title='53597'>'They were certainly very much larger than any which he could have made, and were evidently quite fresh. </span>
<span sid='53598' title='53598'>It rained hard this afternoon, as you know, and my patients were the only people who called. </span>
<span sid='53599' title='53599'>It must have been the case, then, that the man in the waiting-room had for some unknown reason, while I was busy with the other, ascended to the room of my resident patient. </span>
<span sid='53600' title='53600'>Nothing had been touched or taken, but there were the footprints to prove that the intrusion was an undoubted fact.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53601' title='53601'>'Mr Blessington seemed more excited over the matter than I should have thought possible, though, of course, it was enough to disturb anybody's peace of mind. </span>
<span sid='53602' title='53602'>He actually sat crying in an arm-chair, and I could hardly get him to speak coherently. </span>
<span sid='53603' title='53603'>It was his suggestion that I should come round to you, and of course I at once saw the propriety of it, for certainly the incident is a very singular one, though he appears to completely overrate its importance. </span>
<span sid='53604' title='53604'>If you would only come back with me in my brougham, you would at least be able to soothe him, though I can hardly hope that you will be able to explain this remarkable occurrence.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53605' title='53605'>Sherlock Holmes had listened to this long narrative with an intentness which showed me that his interest was keenly aroused. </span>
<span sid='53606' title='53606'>His face was as impassive as ever, but his lids had drooped more heavily over his eyes, and his smoke had curled up more thickly from his pipe to emphasize each curious episode in the doctor's tale. </span>
<span sid='53607' title='53607'>As our visitor concluded Holmes sprang up without a word, handed me my hat, picked up his own from the table, and followed Dr Trevelyan to the door. </span>
<span sid='53608' title='53608'>Within a quarter of an hour we had been dropped at the door of the physician's residence in Brook Street, one of those sombre, flat-faced houses which one associates with a West-end practice. </span>
<span sid='53609' title='53609'>A small page admitted us, and we began at once to ascend the broad, well-carpeted stair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53610' title='53610'>But a singular interruption brought us to a standstill. </span>
<span sid='53611' title='53611'>The light at the top was suddenly whisked out, and from the darkness came a reedy, quavering voice.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53612' title='53612'>'I have a pistol,' it cried; 'I give you my word that I'll fire if you come any nearer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53613' title='53613'>'This really grows outrageous, Mr Blessington,' cried Dr Trevelyan.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53614' title='53614'>'Oh, then it is you, Doctor?' said the voice, with a great heave of relief. </span>
<span sid='53615' title='53615'>'But those other gentlemen, are they what they pretend to be?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53616' title='53616'>We were conscious of a long scrutiny out of the darkness.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53617' title='53617'>'Yes, yes, it's all right,' said the voice at last. </span>
<span sid='53618' title='53618'>'You can come up, and I am sorry if my precautions have annoyed you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53619' title='53619'>He re-lit the stair gas as he spoke, and we saw before us a singular-looking man, whose appearance, as well as his voice, testified to his jangled nerves. </span>
<span sid='53620' title='53620'>He was very fat, but had apparently at some time been much fatter, so that the skin hung about his face in loose pouches, like the cheeks of a blood-hound. </span>
<span sid='53621' title='53621'>He was of a sickly colour, and his thin sandy hair seemed to bristle up with the intensity of his emotion. </span>
<span sid='53622' title='53622'>In his hand he held a pistol, but he thrust it into his pocket as we advanced.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53623' title='53623'>'Good evening, Mr Holmes,' said he; 'I am sure I am very much obliged to you for coming round. </span>
<span sid='53624' title='53624'>No one ever needed your advice more than I do. </span>
<span sid='53625' title='53625'>I suppose that Dr Trevelyan has told you of this most unwarrantable intrusion into my rooms.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53626' title='53626'>'Quite so,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='53627' title='53627'>'Who are these two men, Mr Blessington, and why do they wish to molest you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53628' title='53628'>'Well, well,' said the resident patient, in a nervous fashion, 'of course, it is hard to say that. </span>
<span sid='53629' title='53629'>You can hardly expect me to answer that, Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53630' title='53630'>'Do you mean that you don't know?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53631' title='53631'>'Come in here, if you please. </span>
<span sid='53632' title='53632'>Just have the kindness to step in here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53633' title='53633'>He led the way into his bedroom, which was large and comfortably furnished.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53634' title='53634'>'You see that,' said he, pointing to a big black box at the end of his bed. </span>
<span sid='53635' title='53635'>'I have never been a very rich man, Mr Holmes - never made but one investment in my life, as Dr Trevelyan would tell you. </span>
<span sid='53636' title='53636'>But I don't believe in bankers. </span>
<span sid='53637' title='53637'>I would never trust a banker, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='53638' title='53638'>Between ourselves, what little I have is in that box, so you can understand what it means to me when unknown people force themselves into my rooms.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53639' title='53639'>Holmes looked at Blessington in his questioning way, and shook his head.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53640' title='53640'>'I cannot possibly advise you if you try to deceive me,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53641' title='53641'>'But I have told you everything.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53642' title='53642'>Holmes turned on his heel with a gesture of disgust. </span>
<span sid='53643' title='53643'>'Good-night, Dr Trevelyan,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53644' title='53644'>'And no advice for me?' cried Blessington, in a breaking voice.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53645' title='53645'>'My advice to you, sir, is to speak the truth.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53646' title='53646'>A minute later we' were in the street and walking for home. </span>
<span sid='53647' title='53647'>We had crossed <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Oxford Street&t=h'>Oxford Street</a>, and were half-way down <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Harley Street&t=h'>Harley Street</a> before I could get a word from my companion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53648' title='53648'>'Sorry to bring you out on such a fool's errand, Watson,' he said at last. </span>
<span sid='53649' title='53649'>'It is an interesting case, too, at the bottom of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53650' title='53650'>'I can make little of it,' I confessed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53651' title='53651'>'Well, it is quite evident that there are two men - more, perhaps, but at least two - who are determined for some reason to get at this fellow Blessington. </span>
<span sid='53652' title='53652'>I have no doubt in my mind that both on the first and on the second occasion that young man penetrated to Blessington's room, while his confederate, by an ingenious device, kept the doctor from interfering.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53653' title='53653'>'And the catalepsy!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53654' title='53654'>'A fraudulent imitation, Watson, though I should hardly dare to hint as much to our specialist. </span>
<span sid='53655' title='53655'>It is a very easy complaint to imitate. </span>
<span sid='53656' title='53656'>I have done it myself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53657' title='53657'>'And then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53658' title='53658'>'By the purest chance Blessington was out on each occasion. </span>
<span sid='53659' title='53659'>Their reason for choosing so unusual an hour for a consultation was obviously to insure that there should be no other patient in the waiting-room. </span>
<span sid='53660' title='53660'>It just happened, however, that this hour coincided with Blessington's constitutional, which seems to show that they were not very well acquainted with his daily routine. </span>
<span sid='53661' title='53661'>Of course, if they had been merely after plunder they would at least have made some attempt to search for it. </span>
<span sid='53662' title='53662'>Besides, I can read in a man's eye when it is his own skin that he is frightened for. </span>
<span sid='53663' title='53663'>It is inconceivable that this fellow could have made two such vindictive enemies as these appear to be without knowing of it. </span>
<span sid='53664' title='53664'>I hold it, therefore, to be certain that he does know who these men are, and that for reasons of his own he suppresses it. </span>
<span sid='53665' title='53665'>It is just possible that to-morrow may find him in a more communicative mood.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53666' title='53666'>'Is there not one alternative,' I suggested, 'grotesquely improbable, no doubt, but still just conceivable? </span>
<span sid='53667' title='53667'>Might the whole story of the cataleptic <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Russia&t=h'>Russia</a>n and his son be a concoction of Dr Trevelyan's, who has, for his own purposes, been in Blessington's rooms?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53668' title='53668'>I saw in the gaslight that Holmes wore an amused smile at this brilliant departure of mine.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53669' title='53669'>'My dear fellow,' said he, 'it was one of the first solutions which occurred to me, but I was soon able to corroborate the doctor's tale. </span>
<span sid='53670' title='53670'>This young man has left prints upon the stair carpet which made it quite superfluous for me to ask to see those which he had made in the room. </span>
<span sid='53671' title='53671'>When I tell you that his shoes were square-toed, instead of being pointed like Blessington's, and were quite an inch and a third longer than the doctor's, you will acknowledge that there can be no doubt as to his individuality. </span>
<span sid='53672' title='53672'>But we may sleep on it now, for I shall be surprised if we do not hear something further from Brook Street in the morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53673' title='53673'>Sherlock Holmes's prophecy was soon fulfilled, and in a dramatic fashion. </span>
<span sid='53674' title='53674'>At half-past seven next morning, in the first dim glimmer of daylight, I found him standing by my bedside in his dressing-gown.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53675' title='53675'>'There's a brougham waiting for us, Watson,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53676' title='53676'>'What's the matter, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53677' title='53677'>'The Brook Street business.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53678' title='53678'>'Any fresh news?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53679' title='53679'>'Tragic but ambiguous,' said he, pulling up the blind. </span>
<span sid='53680' title='53680'>'Look at this - a sheet from a notebook with "For God's sake, come at once - P. T." scrawled upon it in pencil. </span>
<span sid='53681' title='53681'>Our friend the doctor was hard put to it when he wrote this. </span>
<span sid='53682' title='53682'>Come along, my dear fellow, for it's an urgent call.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53683' title='53683'>In a quarter of an hour or so we were back at the physician's house. </span>
<span sid='53684' title='53684'>He came running out to meet us with a face of horror.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53685' title='53685'>'Oh, such a business!' he cried, with his hands to his temples.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53686' title='53686'>'What, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53687' title='53687'>'Blessington has committed suicide!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53688' title='53688'>Holmes whistled.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53689' title='53689'>'Yes, he hanged himself during the night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53690' title='53690'>We had entered, and the doctor had preceded us into what was evidently his waiting-room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53691' title='53691'>'I really hardly know what I am doing,' he cried. </span>
<span sid='53692' title='53692'>'The police are already upstairs. </span>
<span sid='53693' title='53693'>It has shaken me most dreadfully.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53694' title='53694'>'When did you find it out?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53695' title='53695'>'He has a cup of tea taken in to him early every morning. </span>
<span sid='53696' title='53696'>When the maid entered about seven, there the unfortunate fellow was hanging in the middle of the room. </span>
<span sid='53697' title='53697'>He had tied his cord to the hook on which the heavy lamp used to hang, and he had jumped off from the top of the very box that he showed us yesterday.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53698' title='53698'>Holmes stood for a moment in deep thought.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53699' title='53699'>'With your permission,' said he at last, 'I should like to go upstairs and look into the matter.' </span>
<span sid='53700' title='53700'>We both ascended, followed by the doctor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53701' title='53701'>It was a dreadful sight which met us as we entered the bedroom door. </span>
<span sid='53702' title='53702'>I have spoken of the impression of flabbiness which this man Blessington conveyed. </span>
<span sid='53703' title='53703'>As he dangled from the hook it was exaggerated and intensified until he was scarce human in his appearance. </span>
<span sid='53704' title='53704'>The neck was drawn out like a plucked chicken's, making the rest of him seem the more obese and unnatural by the contrast. </span>
<span sid='53705' title='53705'>He was clad only in his long night-dress, and his swollen ankles and ungainly feet protruded starkly from beneath it. </span>
<span sid='53706' title='53706'>Beside him stood a smart-looking police inspector, who was taking notes in a pocket-book.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53707' title='53707'>'Ah, Mr Holmes,' said he, heartily, as my friend entered. </span>
<span sid='53708' title='53708'>'I am delighted to see you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53709' title='53709'>'Good morning, Lanner,' answered Holmes. </span>
<span sid='53710' title='53710'>'You won't think me an intruder, I am sure. </span>
<span sid='53711' title='53711'>Have you heard of the events which led up to this affair?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53712' title='53712'>'Yes, I heard something of them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53713' title='53713'>'Have you formed any opinion?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53714' title='53714'>'As far as I can see, the man has been driven out of his senses by fright. </span>
<span sid='53715' title='53715'>The bed has been well slept in, you see. </span>
<span sid='53716' title='53716'>There's his impression deep enough. </span>
<span sid='53717' title='53717'>It's about five in the morning, you know, that suicides are most common. </span>
<span sid='53718' title='53718'>That would be about his time for hanging himself. </span>
<span sid='53719' title='53719'>It seems to have been a very deliberate affair.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53720' title='53720'>'I should say that he has been dead about three hours, judging by the rigidity of the muscles,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53721' title='53721'>'Noticed anything peculiar about the room?' asked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53722' title='53722'>'Found a screwdriver and some screws on the wash-hand stand. </span>
<span sid='53723' title='53723'>Seems to have smoked heavily during the night, too. </span>
<span sid='53724' title='53724'>Here are four cigar ends that I picked out of the fireplace.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53725' title='53725'>'Hum!' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='53726' title='53726'>'Have you got his cigar-holder?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53727' title='53727'>'No, I have seen none.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53728' title='53728'>'His cigar-case, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53729' title='53729'>'Yes, it was in his coat pocket.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53730' title='53730'>Holmes opened it and smelled the single cigar which it contained.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53731' title='53731'>'Oh, this is a Havana, and these others are cigars of the peculiar sort which are imported by the Dutch from their East Indian colonies. </span>
<span sid='53732' title='53732'>They are usually wrapped in straw, you know, and are thinner for their length than any other brand.' </span>
<span sid='53733' title='53733'>He picked up the four ends and examined them with his pocket lens.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53734' title='53734'>'Two of these have been smoked from a holder and two without,' said he. </span>
<span sid='53735' title='53735'>'Two have been cut by a not very sharp knife, and two have had the ends bitten off by a set of excellent teeth. </span>
<span sid='53736' title='53736'>This is no suicide, Mr Lanner. </span>
<span sid='53737' title='53737'>It is a very deeply-planned and cold-blooded murder.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53738' title='53738'>'Impossible!' cried the inspector.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53739' title='53739'>'And why?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53740' title='53740'>'Why should anyone murder a man in so clumsy a fashion as by hanging him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53741' title='53741'>'That is what we have to find out.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53742' title='53742'>'How could they get in?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53743' title='53743'>'Through the front door.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53744' title='53744'>'It was barred in the morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53745' title='53745'>'Then it was barred after them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53746' title='53746'>'How do you know?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53747' title='53747'>'I saw their traces. </span>
<span sid='53748' title='53748'>Excuse me a moment, and I may be able to give you some further information about it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53749' title='53749'>He went over to the door, and turning the lock he examined it in his methodical fashion. </span>
<span sid='53750' title='53750'>Then he took out the key, which was on the inside, and inspected that also. </span>
<span sid='53751' title='53751'>The bed, the carpet, the chairs, the mantelpiece, the dead body, and the rope were each in turn examined, until at last he professed himself satisfied, and with my aid and that of the inspector cut down the wretched object, and laid it reverently under a sheet.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53752' title='53752'>'How about this rope?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53753' title='53753'>'It is cut off this,' said Dr Trevelyan, drawing a large coil from under the bed. </span>
<span sid='53754' title='53754'>'He was morbidly nervous of fire, and always kept this beside him, so that he might escape by the window in case the stairs were burning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53755' title='53755'>'That must have saved them trouble,' said Holmes, thoughtfully. </span>
<span sid='53756' title='53756'>'Yes, the actual facts are very plain, and I shall be surprised if by the afternoon I cannot give you the reasons for them as well. </span>
<span sid='53757' title='53757'>I will take this photograph of Blessington which I see upon the mantelpiece, as it may help me in my inquiries.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53758' title='53758'>'But you have told us nothing,' cried the doctor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53759' title='53759'>'Oh, there can be no doubt as to the sequence of events,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='53760' title='53760'>'There were three of them in it: the young man, the old man, and a third to whose identity I have no clue. </span>
<span sid='53761' title='53761'>The first two, I need hardly remark, are the same who masqueraded as the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Russia&t=h'>Russia</a>n Count and his son, so we can give a very full description of them. </span>
<span sid='53762' title='53762'>They were admitted by a confederate inside the house. </span>
<span sid='53763' title='53763'>If I might offer you a word of advice, Inspector, it would be to arrest the page, who, as I understand, has only recently come into your service, Doctor.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53764' title='53764'>'The young imp cannot be found,' said Dr Trevelyan; 'the maid and the cook have just been searching for him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53765' title='53765'>Holmes shrugged his shoulders.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53766' title='53766'>'He has played a not unimportant part in this drama,' said he. </span>
<span sid='53767' title='53767'>'The three men having ascended the stair, which they did on tiptoe, the elder man first, the younger man second, and the unknown man in the rear-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53768' title='53768'>'My dear Holmes!' I ejaculated.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53769' title='53769'>'Oh, there could be no question as to the superimposing of the footmarks. </span>
<span sid='53770' title='53770'>I had the advantage of learning which was which last night. </span>
<span sid='53771' title='53771'>They ascended then to Mr Blessington's room, the door of which they found to be locked. </span>
<span sid='53772' title='53772'>With the help of a wire, however, they forced round the key. </span>
<span sid='53773' title='53773'>Even without a lens, you will perceive by the scratches on this ward where the pressure was applied.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53774' title='53774'>'On entering the room, their first proceeding must have been to gag Mr Blessington. </span>
<span sid='53775' title='53775'>He may have been asleep, or he may have been so paralysed with terror as to have been unable to cry out. </span>
<span sid='53776' title='53776'>These walls are thick, and it is conceivable that his shriek, if he had time to utter one, was unheard.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53777' title='53777'>'Having secured him, it is evident to me that a consultation of some sort was held. </span>
<span sid='53778' title='53778'>Probably it was something in the nature of a judicial proceeding. </span>
<span sid='53779' title='53779'>It must have lasted for some time, for it was then that these cigars were smoked. </span>
<span sid='53780' title='53780'>The older man sat in that wicker chair: it was he who used the cigar-holder. </span>
<span sid='53781' title='53781'>The younger man sat over yonder: he knocked his ash off against the chest of drawers. </span>
<span sid='53782' title='53782'>The third fellow paced up and down. </span>
<span sid='53783' title='53783'>Blessington, I think, sat upright in the bed, but of that I cannot be absolutely certain.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53784' title='53784'>'Well, it ended by their taking Blessington and hanging him. </span>
<span sid='53785' title='53785'>The matter was so prearranged that it is my belief that they brought with them some sort of block or pulley which might serve as a gallows. </span>
<span sid='53786' title='53786'>That screwdriver and those screws were, as I conceive, for fixing it up. </span>
<span sid='53787' title='53787'>Seeing the hook, however, they naturally saved themselves the trouble. </span>
<span sid='53788' title='53788'>Having finished their work they made off, and the door was barred behind them by their confederate.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53789' title='53789'>We had all listened with the deepest interest to this sketch of the night's doings, which Holmes had deduced from signs so subtle and minute, that even when he had pointed them out to us, we could scarcely follow him in his reasonings. </span>
<span sid='53790' title='53790'>The inspector hurried away on the instant to make inquiries about the page, while Holmes and I returned to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> for breakfast.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53791' title='53791'>'I'll be back by three,' said he when we had finished our meal. </span>
<span sid='53792' title='53792'>'Both the inspector and the doctor will meet me here at that hour, and I hope by that time to have cleared up any little obscurity which the case may still present.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53793' title='53793'>Our visitors arrived at the appointed time, but it was a quarter to four before my friend put in an appearance. </span>
<span sid='53794' title='53794'>From his expression as he entered, however, I could see that all had gone well with him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53795' title='53795'>'Any news, Inspector?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53796' title='53796'>'We have got the boy, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53797' title='53797'>'Excellent, and I have got the men.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53798' title='53798'>'You have got them!' we cried all three.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53799' title='53799'>'Well, at least I have got their identity. </span>
<span sid='53800' title='53800'>This so-called Blessington is, as I expected, well known at headquarters, and so are his assailants. </span>
<span sid='53801' title='53801'>Their names are Biddle, Hayward, and Moffat.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53802' title='53802'>'The Worthingdon bank gang,' cried the inspector.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53803' title='53803'>'Precisely,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53804' title='53804'>'Then Blessington must have been Sutton?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53805' title='53805'>'Exactly,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53806' title='53806'>'Why, that makes it as clear as crystal,' said the inspector.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53807' title='53807'>But Trevelyan and I looked at each other in bewilderment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53808' title='53808'>'You must surely remember the great Worthingdon bank business,' said Holmes; 'five men were in it, these four and a fifth called Cartwright. </span>
<span sid='53809' title='53809'>Tobin, the caretaker, was murdered, and the thieves got away with seven thousand pounds. </span>
<span sid='53810' title='53810'>This was in 1875. </span>
<span sid='53811' title='53811'>They were all five arrested, but the evidence against them was by no means conclusive. </span>
<span sid='53812' title='53812'>This Blessington, or Sutton, who was the worst of the gang, turned informer. </span>
<span sid='53813' title='53813'>On his evidence, Cartwright was hanged and the other three got fifteen years apiece. </span>
<span sid='53814' title='53814'>When they got out the other day, which was some years before their full term, they set themselves, as you perceive, to hunt down the traitor and to avenge the death of their comrade upon him. </span>
<span sid='53815' title='53815'>Twice they tried to get at him and failed; a third time, you see, it came off. </span>
<span sid='53816' title='53816'>Is there anything further which I can explain, Dr Trevelyan?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53817' title='53817'>'I think you have made it all remarkably clear,' said the doctor. </span>
<span sid='53818' title='53818'>'No doubt the day on which he was so perturbed was the day when he had read of their release in the newspapers.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53819' title='53819'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='53820' title='53820'>His talk about a burglary was the merest blind.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53821' title='53821'>'But why could he not tell you this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53822' title='53822'>'Well, my dear sir, knowing the vindictive character of his old associates, he was trying to hide his own identity from everybody as long as he could. </span>
<span sid='53823' title='53823'>His secret was a shameful one, and he could not bring himself to divulge it. </span>
<span sid='53824' title='53824'>However, wretch as he was, he was still living under the shield of British law, and I have no doubt, Inspector, that you will see that, though that shield may fail to guard, the sword of justice is still there to avenge.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53825' title='53825'>Such were the singular circumstances in connection with the resident patient and the Brook Street doctor. </span>
<span sid='53826' title='53826'>From that night nothing has been seen of the three murderers by the police, and it is surmised at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a> that they were among the passengers of the ill-fated steamer Norah Creina, which was lost some years ago with all hands upon the Portuguese coast, some leagues to the north of Oporto. </span>
<span sid='53827' title='53827'>The proceedings against the page broke down for want of evidence, and the 'Brook Street Mystery,' as it was called, has never, until now, been fully dealt with in any public print.</span>
