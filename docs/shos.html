<p>
<span sid='20185' title='20185'>Sherlock Holmes had been bending for a long time over a low-power microscope. </span>
<span sid='20186' title='20186'>Now he straightened himself up and looked round at me in triumph.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20187' title='20187'>'It is glue, Watson,' said he. </span>
<span sid='20188' title='20188'>'Unquestionably it is glue. </span>
<span sid='20189' title='20189'>Have a look at these scattered objects in the field!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20190' title='20190'>I stooped to the eyepiece and focused for my vision.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20191' title='20191'>'Those hairs are threads from a tweed coat. </span>
<span sid='20192' title='20192'>The irregular grey masses are dust. </span>
<span sid='20193' title='20193'>There are epithelial scales on the left. </span>
<span sid='20194' title='20194'>Those brown blobs in the centre are undoubtedly glue.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20195' title='20195'>'Well,' I said, laughing, 'I am prepared to take your word for it. </span>
<span sid='20196' title='20196'>Does anything depend upon it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20197' title='20197'>'It is a very fine demonstration,' he answered. </span>
<span sid='20198' title='20198'>'In the St Pancras case you may remember that a cap was found beside the dead policeman. </span>
<span sid='20199' title='20199'>The accused man denies that it is his. </span>
<span sid='20200' title='20200'>But he is a picture-frame maker who habitually handles glue.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20201' title='20201'>'Is it one of your cases?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20202' title='20202'>'No, my friend, Merivale of the Yard, asked me to look into the case. </span>
<span sid='20203' title='20203'>Since I ran down that coiner by the zinc and copper filings in the seam of his cuff they have begun to realize the importance of the microscope.' </span>
<span sid='20204' title='20204'>He looked impatiently at his watch. </span>
<span sid='20205' title='20205'>'I had a new client calling, but he is overdue. </span>
<span sid='20206' title='20206'>By the way, Watson, you know something of racing?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20207' title='20207'>'I ought to. </span>
<span sid='20208' title='20208'>I pay for it with about half my wound pension.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20209' title='20209'>'Then I'll make you my "Handy Guide to the Turf". </span>
<span sid='20210' title='20210'>What about Sir Robert Norberton? </span>
<span sid='20211' title='20211'>Does the name recall anything?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20212' title='20212'>'Well, I should say so. </span>
<span sid='20213' title='20213'>He lives at Shoscombe Old Place, and I know it well, for my summer quarters were down there once. </span>
<span sid='20214' title='20214'>Norberton nearly came within your province once.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20215' title='20215'>'How was that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20216' title='20216'>'It was when he horsewhipped Sam Brewer, the well-known <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Curzon Street&t=h'>Curzon Street</a> moneylender, on <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Newmarket Heath&t=h'>Newmarket Heath</a>. </span>
<span sid='20217' title='20217'>He nearly killed the man.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20218' title='20218'>'Ah, he sounds interesting! </span>
<span sid='20219' title='20219'>Does he often indulge in that way?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20220' title='20220'>'Well, he has the name of being a dangerous man. </span>
<span sid='20221' title='20221'>He is about the most daredevil rider in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> - second in the Grand National a few years back. </span>
<span sid='20222' title='20222'>He is one of those men who have overshot their true generation. </span>
<span sid='20223' title='20223'>He should have been a buck in the days of the Regency - a boxer, an athlete, a plunger on the Turf, a lover of fair ladies, and, by all account, so far down Queer Street that he may never find his way back again.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20224' title='20224'>'Capital, Watson. </span>
<span sid='20225' title='20225'>A thumb-nail sketch. </span>
<span sid='20226' title='20226'>I seem to know the man. </span>
<span sid='20227' title='20227'>Now, can you give me some idea of Shoscombe Old Place?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20228' title='20228'>'Only that it is in the centre of Shoscombe Park, and that the famous Shoscombe stud and training quarters are to be found there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20229' title='20229'>'And the head trainer', said Holmes, 'is John Mason. </span>
<span sid='20230' title='20230'>You need not look surprised at my knowledge, Watson, for this is a letter from him which I am unfolding. </span>
<span sid='20231' title='20231'>But let us have some more about Shoscombe. </span>
<span sid='20232' title='20232'>I seem to have struck a rich vein.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20233' title='20233'>'There are the Shoscombe spaniels,' said I. </span>
<span sid='20234' title='20234'>'You hear of them at every dog show. </span>
<span sid='20235' title='20235'>The most exclusive breed in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>. </span>
<span sid='20236' title='20236'>They are the special pride of the lady of Shoscombe Old Place.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20237' title='20237'>'Sir Robert Norberton's wife, I presume!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20238' title='20238'>'Sir Robert has never married. </span>
<span sid='20239' title='20239'>Just as well, I think, considering his prospects. </span>
<span sid='20240' title='20240'>He lives with his widowed sister, Lady Beatrice Falder.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20241' title='20241'>'You mean that she lives with him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20242' title='20242'>'No, no. </span>
<span sid='20243' title='20243'>The place belonged to her late husband, Sir James. </span>
<span sid='20244' title='20244'>Norberton has no claim on it at all. </span>
<span sid='20245' title='20245'>It is only a life interest and reverts to her husband's brother. </span>
<span sid='20246' title='20246'>Meantime, she draws the rents every year.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20247' title='20247'>'And brother Robert, I suppose, spends the said rents?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20248' title='20248'>'That is about the size of it. </span>
<span sid='20249' title='20249'>He is a devil of a fellow and must lead her a most uneasy life. </span>
<span sid='20250' title='20250'>Yet I have heard that she is devoted to him. </span>
<span sid='20251' title='20251'>But what is amiss at Shoscombe?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20252' title='20252'>'Ah, that is just what I want to know. </span>
<span sid='20253' title='20253'>And here, I expect, is the man who can tell us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20254' title='20254'>The door opened and the page had shown in a tall, cleanshaven man with the firm, austere expression which is only seen upon those who have to control horses or boys. </span>
<span sid='20255' title='20255'>Mr John Mason had many of both under his sway, and he looked equal to the task. </span>
<span sid='20256' title='20256'>He bowed with cold self-possession and seated himself upon the chair to which Holmes had waved him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20257' title='20257'>'You had my note, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20258' title='20258'>'Yes, but it explained nothing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20259' title='20259'>'It was too delicate a thing for me to put the details on paper. </span>
<span sid='20260' title='20260'>And too complicated. </span>
<span sid='20261' title='20261'>It was only face to face I could do it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20262' title='20262'>'Well, we are at your disposal.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20263' title='20263'>'First of all, Mr Holmes, I think that my employer, Sir Robert, has gone mad.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20264' title='20264'>Holmes raised his eyebrows. </span>
<span sid='20265' title='20265'>'This is <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>, not <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Harley Street&t=h'>Harley Street</a>,' said he. </span>
<span sid='20266' title='20266'>'But why do you say so?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20267' title='20267'>'Well, sir, when a man does one queer thing, or two queer things, there may be a meaning to it, but when everything he does is queer, then you begin to wonder. </span>
<span sid='20268' title='20268'>I believe Shoscombe Prince and the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Derby&t=h'>Derby</a> have turned his brain.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20269' title='20269'>'That is a colt you are running?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20270' title='20270'>'The best in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='20271' title='20271'>I should know, if anyone does. </span>
<span sid='20272' title='20272'>Now, I'll be plain with you, for I know you are gentlemen of honour and that it won't go beyond the room. </span>
<span sid='20273' title='20273'>Sir Robert has got to win this <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Derby&t=h'>Derby</a>. </span>
<span sid='20274' title='20274'>He's up to the neck, and it's his last chance. </span>
<span sid='20275' title='20275'>Everything he could raise or borrow is on the horse - and at fine odds, too! </span>
<span sid='20276' title='20276'>You can get forties now, but it was nearer the hundred when he began to back him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20277' title='20277'>'But how is that, if the horse is so good?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20278' title='20278'>'The public don't know how good he is. </span>
<span sid='20279' title='20279'>Sir Robert has been too clever for the touts. </span>
<span sid='20280' title='20280'>He has the Prince's half-brother out for spins. </span>
<span sid='20281' title='20281'>You can't tell 'em apart. </span>
<span sid='20282' title='20282'>But there are two lengths in a furlong between them when it comes to a gallop. </span>
<span sid='20283' title='20283'>He thinks of nothing but the horse and the race. </span>
<span sid='20284' title='20284'>His whole life is on it. </span>
<span sid='20285' title='20285'>He's holding off the Jews till then. </span>
<span sid='20286' title='20286'>If the Prince fails him, he is done.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20287' title='20287'>'It seems a rather desperate gamble, but where does the madness come in?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20288' title='20288'>'Well, first of all, you have only to look at him. </span>
<span sid='20289' title='20289'>I don't believe he sleeps at night. </span>
<span sid='20290' title='20290'>He is down at the stables at all hours. </span>
<span sid='20291' title='20291'>His eyes are wild. </span>
<span sid='20292' title='20292'>It has all been too much for his nerves. </span>
<span sid='20293' title='20293'>Then there is his conduct to Lady Beatrice!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20294' title='20294'>'Ah! what is that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20295' title='20295'>'They have always been the best of friends. </span>
<span sid='20296' title='20296'>They had the same tastes, the two of them, and she loved the horses as much as he did. </span>
<span sid='20297' title='20297'>Every day at the same hour she would drive down to see them - and, above all she loved the Prince. </span>
<span sid='20298' title='20298'>He would prick up his ears when he heard the wheels on the gravel, and he would trot out each morning to the carriage to get his lump of sugar. </span>
<span sid='20299' title='20299'>But that's all over now.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20300' title='20300'>'Why?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20301' title='20301'>'Well, she seems to have lost all interest in the horses. </span>
<span sid='20302' title='20302'>For a week now she has driven past the stables with never so much as "good morning"!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20303' title='20303'>'You think there has been a quarrel?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20304' title='20304'>'And a bitter, savage, spiteful quarrel at that. </span>
<span sid='20305' title='20305'>Why else would he give away her pet spaniel that she loved as if he were her child? </span>
<span sid='20306' title='20306'>He gave it a few days ago to old Barnes, what keeps the "Green Dragon", three miles off, at Crendall.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20307' title='20307'>'That certainly did seem strange.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20308' title='20308'>'Of course, with her weak heart and dropsy one couldn't expect that she could get about with him, but he spent two hours every evening in her room. </span>
<span sid='20309' title='20309'>He might well do what he could, for she has been a rare good friend to him. </span>
<span sid='20310' title='20310'>But that's all over, too. </span>
<span sid='20311' title='20311'>He never goes near her. </span>
<span sid='20312' title='20312'>And she takes it to heart. </span>
<span sid='20313' title='20313'>She is brooding and sulky and drinking, Mr Holmes - drinking like a fish.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20314' title='20314'>'Did she drink before this estrangement?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20315' title='20315'>'Well, she took her glass, but now it is often a whole bottle of an evening. </span>
<span sid='20316' title='20316'>So Stephens, the butler, told me. </span>
<span sid='20317' title='20317'>It's all changed, Mr Holmes, and there is something damned rotten about it. </span>
<span sid='20318' title='20318'>But then, again, what is master doing down at the old church crypt at night? </span>
<span sid='20319' title='20319'>And who is the man that meets him there?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20320' title='20320'>Holmes rubbed his hands.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20321' title='20321'>'Go on, Mr Mason. </span>
<span sid='20322' title='20322'>You get more and more interesting.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20323' title='20323'>'It was the butler who saw him go. </span>
<span sid='20324' title='20324'>Twelve o'clock at night and raining hard. </span>
<span sid='20325' title='20325'>So next night I was up at the house and, sure enough, master was off again. </span>
<span sid='20326' title='20326'>Stephens and I went after him, but it was jumpy work, for it would have been a bad job if he had seen us. </span>
<span sid='20327' title='20327'>He's a terrible man with his fists if he gets started, and no respecter of persons. </span>
<span sid='20328' title='20328'>So we were shy of getting too near, but we marked him down all right. </span>
<span sid='20329' title='20329'>It was the haunted crypt that he was making for, and there was a man waiting for him there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20330' title='20330'>'What is this haunted crypt?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20331' title='20331'>'Well, sir, there is an old ruined chapel in the park. </span>
<span sid='20332' title='20332'>It is so old that nobody could fix its date. </span>
<span sid='20333' title='20333'>And under it there's a crypt which has a bad name among us. </span>
<span sid='20334' title='20334'>It's a dark, damp, lonely place by day, but there are few in that county that would have the nerve to go near it at night. </span>
<span sid='20335' title='20335'>But master's not afraid. </span>
<span sid='20336' title='20336'>He never feared anything in his life. </span>
<span sid='20337' title='20337'>But what is he doing there in the night-time?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20338' title='20338'>'Wait a bit!' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='20339' title='20339'>'You say there is another man there. </span>
<span sid='20340' title='20340'>It must be one of your own stable-men, or someone from the house! </span>
<span sid='20341' title='20341'>Surely you have only to spot who it is and question him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20342' title='20342'>'It's no one I know.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20343' title='20343'>'How can you say that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20344' title='20344'>'Because I have seen him, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='20345' title='20345'>It was on that second night. </span>
<span sid='20346' title='20346'>Sir Robert turned and passed us - me and Stephens, quaking in the bushes like two bunny-rabbits, for there was a bit of moon that night. </span>
<span sid='20347' title='20347'>But we could hear the other moving about behind. </span>
<span sid='20348' title='20348'>We were not afraid of him. </span>
<span sid='20349' title='20349'>So we up when Sir Robert was gone and pretended we were just having a walk like in the moonlight, and so we came right on him as casual and innocent as you please. </span>
<span sid='20350' title='20350'>"Hullo, mate! who may you be?" says I. </span>
<span sid='20351' title='20351'>I guess he had not heard us coming, so he looked over his shoulder with a face as if he had seen the Devil coming out of Hell. </span>
<span sid='20352' title='20352'>He let out a yell, and away he went as hard as he could lick it in the darkness. </span>
<span sid='20353' title='20353'>He could run! </span>
<span sid='20354' title='20354'>- I'll give him that. </span>
<span sid='20355' title='20355'>In a minute he was out of sight and hearing, and who he was, or what he was, we never found.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20356' title='20356'>'But you saw him clearly in the moonlight?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20357' title='20357'>'Yes, I would swear to his yellow face - a mean dog, I should say. </span>
<span sid='20358' title='20358'>What could he have in common with Sir Robert?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20359' title='20359'>Holmes sat for some time lost in thought.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20360' title='20360'>'Who keeps Lady Beatrice Falder company?' he asked at last.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20361' title='20361'>'There is her maid, Carrie Evans. </span>
<span sid='20362' title='20362'>She has been with her this five years.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20363' title='20363'>'And is, no doubt, devoted?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20364' title='20364'>Mr Mason shuffled uncomfortably.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20365' title='20365'>'She's devoted enough,' he answered at last. </span>
<span sid='20366' title='20366'>'But I won't say to whom.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20367' title='20367'>'Ah!' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20368' title='20368'>'I can't tell tales out of school.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20369' title='20369'>'I quite understand, Mr Mason. </span>
<span sid='20370' title='20370'>Of course, the situation is clear enough. </span>
<span sid='20371' title='20371'>From Dr Watson's description of Sir Robert I can realize that no woman is safe from him. </span>
<span sid='20372' title='20372'>Don't you think the quarrel between brother and sister may lie there?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20373' title='20373'>'Well, the scandal has been pretty clear for a long time.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20374' title='20374'>'But she may not have seen it before. </span>
<span sid='20375' title='20375'>Let us suppose that she has suddenly found it out. </span>
<span sid='20376' title='20376'>She wants to get rid of the woman. </span>
<span sid='20377' title='20377'>Her brother will not permit it. </span>
<span sid='20378' title='20378'>The invalid, with her weak heart and inability to get about, has no means of enforcing her will. </span>
<span sid='20379' title='20379'>The hated maid is still tied to her. </span>
<span sid='20380' title='20380'>The lady refuses to speak, sulks, takes to drink. </span>
<span sid='20381' title='20381'>Sir Robert in his anger takes her pet spaniel away from her. </span>
<span sid='20382' title='20382'>Does not all this hang together?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20383' title='20383'>'Well, it might do - so far as it goes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20384' title='20384'>'Exactly! </span>
<span sid='20385' title='20385'>As far as it goes. </span>
<span sid='20386' title='20386'>How would all that bear upon the visits by night to the old crypt? </span>
<span sid='20387' title='20387'>We can't fit that into our plot.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20388' title='20388'>'No, sir, and there's something more that I can't fit in. </span>
<span sid='20389' title='20389'>Why should Sir Robert want to dig up a dead body?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20390' title='20390'>Holmes sat up abruptly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20391' title='20391'>'We only found it out yesterday - after I had written to you. </span>
<span sid='20392' title='20392'>Yesterday Sir Robert had gone to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, so Stephens and I went down to the crypt. </span>
<span sid='20393' title='20393'>It was all in order, sir, except that in one corner was a bit of a human body.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20394' title='20394'>'You informed the police, I suppose?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20395' title='20395'>Our visitor smiled grimly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20396' title='20396'>'Well, sir, I think it would hardly interest them. </span>
<span sid='20397' title='20397'>It was just the head and a few bones of a mummy. </span>
<span sid='20398' title='20398'>It may have been a thousand years old. </span>
<span sid='20399' title='20399'>But it wasn't there before. </span>
<span sid='20400' title='20400'>That I'll swear, and so will Stephens. </span>
<span sid='20401' title='20401'>It had been stowed away in a corner and covered over with a board, but that corner had always been empty before.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20402' title='20402'>'What did you do with it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20403' title='20403'>'Well, we just left it there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20404' title='20404'>'That was wise. </span>
<span sid='20405' title='20405'>You say Sir Robert was away yesterday. </span>
<span sid='20406' title='20406'>Has he returned?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20407' title='20407'>'We expect him back to-day.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20408' title='20408'>'When did Sir Robert give away his sister's dog?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20409' title='20409'>'It was just a week ago to-day. </span>
<span sid='20410' title='20410'>The creature was howling outside the old well-house, and Sir Robert was in one of his tantrums that morning. </span>
<span sid='20411' title='20411'>He caught it up and I thought he would have killed it. </span>
<span sid='20412' title='20412'>Then he gave it to Sandy Bain, the jockey, and told him to take the dog to old Barnes at the "Green Dragon", for he never wished to see it again.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20413' title='20413'>Holmes sat for some time in silent thought. </span>
<span sid='20414' title='20414'>He had lit the oldest and foulest of his pipes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20415' title='20415'>'I am not clear yet what you want me to do in this matter, Mr Mason,' he said at last. </span>
<span sid='20416' title='20416'>'Can't you make it more definite?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20417' title='20417'>'Perhaps this will make it more definite, Mr Holmes,' said our visitor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20418' title='20418'>He took a paper from his pocket and, unwrapping it carefully, he exposed a charred fragment of bone.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20419' title='20419'>Holmes examined it with interest.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20420' title='20420'>'Where did you get it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20421' title='20421'>'There is a central heating furnace in the cellar under Lady Beatrice's room. </span>
<span sid='20422' title='20422'>It's been off for some time, but Sir Robert complained of cold and had it on again. </span>
<span sid='20423' title='20423'>Harvey runs it - he's one of my lads. </span>
<span sid='20424' title='20424'>This very morning he came to me with this which he found raking out the cinders. </span>
<span sid='20425' title='20425'>He didn't like the look of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20426' title='20426'>'Nor do I,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='20427' title='20427'>'What do you make of it, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20428' title='20428'>It was burned to a black cinder, but there could be no question as to its anatomical significance.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20429' title='20429'>'It's the upper condyle of a human femur,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20430' title='20430'>'Exactly!' </span>
<span sid='20431' title='20431'>Holmes had become very serious. </span>
<span sid='20432' title='20432'>'When does this lad tend to the furnace?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20433' title='20433'>'He makes it up every evening and then leaves it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20434' title='20434'>'Then anyone could visit it during the night?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20435' title='20435'>'Yes, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20436' title='20436'>'Can you enter it from outside?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20437' title='20437'>'There is one door from outside. </span>
<span sid='20438' title='20438'>There is another which leads up by a stair to the passage in which Lady Beatrice's room is situated.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20439' title='20439'>'These are deep waters, Mr Mason, deep and rather dirty. </span>
<span sid='20440' title='20440'>You say that Sir Robert was not at home last night?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20441' title='20441'>'No, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20442' title='20442'>'Then, whoever was burning bones, it was not he.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20443' title='20443'>'That's true, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20444' title='20444'>'What is the name of that inn you spoke of?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20445' title='20445'>'The "Green Dragon".'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20446' title='20446'>'Is there good fishing in that part of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Berkshire&t=h'>Berkshire</a>?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20447' title='20447'>The honest trainer showed very clearly upon his face that he was convinced that yet another lunatic had come into his harassed life.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20448' title='20448'>'Well, sir, I've heard there are trout in the mill-stream and pike in the Hall lake.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20449' title='20449'>'That's good enough. </span>
<span sid='20450' title='20450'>Watson and I are famous fishermen - are we not, Watson? </span>
<span sid='20451' title='20451'>You may address us in future at the "Green Dragon". </span>
<span sid='20452' title='20452'>We should reach it to-night. </span>
<span sid='20453' title='20453'>I need not say that we don't want to see you, Mr Mason, but a note will reach us, and no doubt I could find you if I want you. </span>
<span sid='20454' title='20454'>When we have gone a little farther into the matter I will let you have a considered opinion.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20455' title='20455'>Thus it was that on a bright May evening Holmes and I found ourselves alone in a first-class carriage and bound for the little 'halt-on-demand' station of Shoscombe. </span>
<span sid='20456' title='20456'>The rack above us was covered with a formidable litter of rods, reels and baskets. </span>
<span sid='20457' title='20457'>On reaching our destination a short drive took us to an old-fashioned tavern, where a sporting host, Josiah Barnes, entered eagerly into our plans for the extirpation of the fish of the neighbourhood.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20458' title='20458'>'What about the Hall lake and the chance of a pike?' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20459' title='20459'>The face of the innkeeper clouded.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20460' title='20460'>'That wouldn't do, sir. </span>
<span sid='20461' title='20461'>You might chance to find yourself in the lake before you were through.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20462' title='20462'>'How's that, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20463' title='20463'>'It's Sir Robert, sir. </span>
<span sid='20464' title='20464'>He's terrible jealous of touts. </span>
<span sid='20465' title='20465'>If you two strangers were as near his training quarters as that he'd be after you as sure as fate. </span>
<span sid='20466' title='20466'>He ain't taking no chances, Sir Robert ain't.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20467' title='20467'>'I've heard he has a horse entered for the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Derby&t=h'>Derby</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20468' title='20468'>'Yes, and a good colt, too. </span>
<span sid='20469' title='20469'>He carries all our money for the race, and all Sir Robert's into the bargain. </span>
<span sid='20470' title='20470'>By the way' - he looked at us with thoughtful eyes - 'I suppose you ain't on the Turf yourselves?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20471' title='20471'>'No, indeed. </span>
<span sid='20472' title='20472'>Just two weary <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>ers who badly need some good <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Berkshire&t=h'>Berkshire</a> air.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20473' title='20473'>'Well, you are in the right place for that. </span>
<span sid='20474' title='20474'>There is a deal of it lying about. </span>
<span sid='20475' title='20475'>But mind what I have told you about Sir Robert. </span>
<span sid='20476' title='20476'>He's the sort that strikes first and speaks afterwards. </span>
<span sid='20477' title='20477'>Keep clear of the park.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20478' title='20478'>'Surely, Mr Barnes! </span>
<span sid='20479' title='20479'>We certainly shall. </span>
<span sid='20480' title='20480'>By the way, that was a most beautiful spaniel that was whining in the hall.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20481' title='20481'>'I should say it was. </span>
<span sid='20482' title='20482'>That was the real Shoscombe breed. </span>
<span sid='20483' title='20483'>There ain't a better in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20484' title='20484'>'I am a dog-fancier myself,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='20485' title='20485'>'Now, if it is a fair question, what would a prize dog like that cost?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20486' title='20486'>'More than I could pay, sir. </span>
<span sid='20487' title='20487'>It was Sir Robert himself who gave me this one. </span>
<span sid='20488' title='20488'>That's why I have to keep it on a lead. </span>
<span sid='20489' title='20489'>It would be off to the Hall in a jiffy if I gave it its head.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20490' title='20490'>'We are getting some cards in our hand, Watson,' said Holmes, when the landlord had left us. </span>
<span sid='20491' title='20491'>'It's not an easy one to play, but we may see our way in a day or two. </span>
<span sid='20492' title='20492'>By the way, Sir Robert is still in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, I hear. </span>
<span sid='20493' title='20493'>We might, perhaps, enter the sacred domain to-night without fear of bodily assault. </span>
<span sid='20494' title='20494'>There are one or two points on which I should like reassurance.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20495' title='20495'>'Have you any theory, Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20496' title='20496'>'Only this, Watson, that something happened a week or so ago which has cut deep into the life of the Shoscombe household. </span>
<span sid='20497' title='20497'>What is that something? </span>
<span sid='20498' title='20498'>We can only guess at it from its effects. </span>
<span sid='20499' title='20499'>They seem to be of a curiously mixed character. </span>
<span sid='20500' title='20500'>But that should surely help us. </span>
<span sid='20501' title='20501'>It is only the colourless, uneventful case which is hopeless.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20502' title='20502'>'Let us consider our data. </span>
<span sid='20503' title='20503'>The brother no longer visits the beloved invalid sister. </span>
<span sid='20504' title='20504'>He gives away her favourite dog. </span>
<span sid='20505' title='20505'>Her dog, Watson! </span>
<span sid='20506' title='20506'>Does that suggest nothing to you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20507' title='20507'>'Nothing but the brother's spite.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20508' title='20508'>'Well, it might be so. </span>
<span sid='20509' title='20509'>Or - well, there is an alternative. </span>
<span sid='20510' title='20510'>Now, to continue our review of the situation from the time that the quarrel, if there is a quarrel, began. </span>
<span sid='20511' title='20511'>The lady keeps her room, alters her habits, is not seen save when she drives out with her maid, refuses to stop at the stables to greet her favourite horse, and apparently takes to drink. </span>
<span sid='20512' title='20512'>That covers the case, does it not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20513' title='20513'>'Save for the business in the crypt.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20514' title='20514'>'That is another line of thought. </span>
<span sid='20515' title='20515'>There are two, and I beg you will not tangle them. </span>
<span sid='20516' title='20516'>Line A, which concerns Lady Beatrice, has a vaguely sinister flavour, has it not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20517' title='20517'>'I can make nothing of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20518' title='20518'>'Well, now, let us take up line B, which concerns Sir Robert. </span>
<span sid='20519' title='20519'>He is mad keen upon winning the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Derby&t=h'>Derby</a>. </span>
<span sid='20520' title='20520'>He is in the hands of the Jews, and may at any moment be sold up and his racing stables seized by his creditors. </span>
<span sid='20521' title='20521'>He is a daring and desperate man. </span>
<span sid='20522' title='20522'>He derives his income from his sister. </span>
<span sid='20523' title='20523'>His sister's maid is his willing tool. </span>
<span sid='20524' title='20524'>So far we seem to be on fairly safe ground, do we not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20525' title='20525'>'But the crypt?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20526' title='20526'>'Ah, yes, the crypt! </span>
<span sid='20527' title='20527'>Let us suppose, Watson - it is merely a scandalous supposition, a hypothesis put forward for argument's sake - that Sir Robert has done away with his sister.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20528' title='20528'>'My dear Holmes, it is out of the question.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20529' title='20529'>'Very possibly, Watson. </span>
<span sid='20530' title='20530'>Sir Robert is a man of an honourable stock. </span>
<span sid='20531' title='20531'>But you do occasionally find a carrion crow among the eagles. </span>
<span sid='20532' title='20532'>Let us for a moment argue upon this supposition. </span>
<span sid='20533' title='20533'>He could not fly the country until he had realized his fortune, and that fortune could only be realized by bringing off this coup with Shoscombe Prince. </span>
<span sid='20534' title='20534'>Therefore he has still to stand his ground. </span>
<span sid='20535' title='20535'>To do this he would have to dispose of the body of his victim, and he would also have to find a substitute who would impersonate her. </span>
<span sid='20536' title='20536'>With the maid as his confidante that would not be impossible. </span>
<span sid='20537' title='20537'>The woman's body might be conveyed to the crypt, which is a place so seldom visited, and it might be secretly destroyed at night in the furnace, leaving behind it such evidence as we have already seen. </span>
<span sid='20538' title='20538'>What say you to that, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20539' title='20539'>'Well, it is all possible if you grant the original monstrous supposition.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20540' title='20540'>'I think that there is a small experiment which we may try to-morrow, Watson, in order to throw some light on the matter. </span>
<span sid='20541' title='20541'>Meanwhile, if we mean to keep up our characters, I suggest that we have our host in for a glass of his own wine and hold some high converse upon eels and dace, which seems to be the straight road to his affections. </span>
<span sid='20542' title='20542'>We may chance to come upon some useful local gossip in the process.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20543' title='20543'>In the morning Holmes discovered that we had come without our spoon-bait for jack, which absolved us from fishing for the day. </span>
<span sid='20544' title='20544'>About eleven o'clock we started for a walk, and he obtained leave to take the black spaniel with us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20545' title='20545'>'This is the place,' said he, as we came to two high park gates with heraldic griffins towering above them. </span>
<span sid='20546' title='20546'>'About midday, Mr Barnes informs me, the old lady takes a drive, and the carriage must slow down while the gates are opened. </span>
<span sid='20547' title='20547'>When it comes through, and before it gathers speed, I want you, Watson, to stop the coachman with some question. </span>
<span sid='20548' title='20548'>Never mind me. </span>
<span sid='20549' title='20549'>I shall stand behind this hollybush and see what I can see.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20550' title='20550'>It was not a long vigil. </span>
<span sid='20551' title='20551'>Within a quarter of an hour we saw the big open yellow barouche coming down the long avenue, with two splendid, high-stepping grey carriage horses in the shafts. </span>
<span sid='20552' title='20552'>Holmes crouched behind his bush with the dog. </span>
<span sid='20553' title='20553'>I stood unconcernedly swinging a cane in the roadway. </span>
<span sid='20554' title='20554'>A keeper ran out and the gates swung open.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20555' title='20555'>The carriage had slowed to a walk and I was able to get a good look at the occupants. </span>
<span sid='20556' title='20556'>A highly-coloured young woman with flaxen hair and impudent eyes sat on the left. </span>
<span sid='20557' title='20557'>At her right was an elderly person with rounded back and a huddle of shawls about her face and shoulders which proclaimed the invalid. </span>
<span sid='20558' title='20558'>When the horses reached the high road I held up my hand with an authoritative gesture, and as the coachman pulled up I inquired if Sir Robert was at Shoscombe Old Place.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20559' title='20559'>At the same moment Holmes stepped out and released the spaniel. </span>
<span sid='20560' title='20560'>With a joyous cry it dashed forward to the carriage and sprang upon the step. </span>
<span sid='20561' title='20561'>Then in a moment its eager greeting changed to furious rage, and it snapped at the back skirt above it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20562' title='20562'>'Drive on! </span>
<span sid='20563' title='20563'>Drive on!' shrieked a harsh voice. </span>
<span sid='20564' title='20564'>The coachman lashed the horses, and we were left standing in the roadway.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20565' title='20565'>'Well, Watson, that's done it,' said Holmes, as he fastened the lead to the neck of the excited spaniel. </span>
<span sid='20566' title='20566'>'He thought it was his mistress and he found it was a stranger. </span>
<span sid='20567' title='20567'>Dogs don't make mistakes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20568' title='20568'>'But it was the voice of a man!' I cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20569' title='20569'>'Exactly! </span>
<span sid='20570' title='20570'>We have added one card to our hand, Watson, but it needs careful playing, all the same.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20571' title='20571'>My companion seemed to have no further plans for the day, and we did actually use our fishing tackle in the mill-stream, with the result that we had a dish of trout for our supper. </span>
<span sid='20572' title='20572'>It was only after that meal that Holmes showed signs of renewed activity. </span>
<span sid='20573' title='20573'>Once more we found ourselves upon the same road as in the morning, which led us to the park gates. </span>
<span sid='20574' title='20574'>A tall, dark figure was awaiting us there, who proved to be our <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> acquaintance, Mr John Mason, the trainer.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20575' title='20575'>'Good evening, gentlemen,' said he. </span>
<span sid='20576' title='20576'>'I got your note, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='20577' title='20577'>Sir Robert has not returned yet, but I hear that he is expected to-night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20578' title='20578'>'How far is this crypt from the house?' asked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20579' title='20579'>'A good quarter of a mile.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20580' title='20580'>'Then I think we can disregard him altogether.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20581' title='20581'>'I can't afford to do that, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='20582' title='20582'>The moment he arrives he will want to see me to get the last news of Shoscombe Prince.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20583' title='20583'>'I see! </span>
<span sid='20584' title='20584'>In that case we must work without you, Mr Mason. </span>
<span sid='20585' title='20585'>You can show us the crypt and then leave us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20586' title='20586'>It was pitch-dark and without a moon, but Mason led us over the grass-lands until a dark mass loomed up in front of us which proved to be the ancient chapel. </span>
<span sid='20587' title='20587'>We entered the broken gap which was once the porch, and our guide, stumbling among heaps of loose masonry, picked his way to the corner of the building, where a steep stair led down into the crypt. </span>
<span sid='20588' title='20588'>Striking a match, he illuminated the melancholy place - dismal and evil-smelling, with ancient crumbling walls of rough-hewn stone, and piles of coffins, some of lead and some of stone, extending upon one side right up to the arched and groined roof which lost itself in the shadows above our heads. </span>
<span sid='20589' title='20589'>Holmes had lit his lantern which shot a tiny tunnel of vivid yellow light upon the mournful scene. </span>
<span sid='20590' title='20590'>Its rays were reflected back from the coffin-plates, many of them adorned with the griffin and coronet of this old family which carried its honours even to the gate of Death.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20591' title='20591'>'You spoke of some bones, Mr Mason. </span>
<span sid='20592' title='20592'>Could you show them before you go?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20593' title='20593'>'They are here in this corner.' </span>
<span sid='20594' title='20594'>The trainer strode across and then stood in silent surprise as our light was turned upon the place. </span>
<span sid='20595' title='20595'>'They are gone,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20596' title='20596'>'So I expected,' said Holmes, chuckling. </span>
<span sid='20597' title='20597'>'I fancy the ashes of them might even now be found in that oven which had already consumed a part.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20598' title='20598'>'But why in the world would anyone want to burn the bones of a man who has been dead a thousand years?' asked John Mason.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20599' title='20599'>'That is what we are here to find out,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='20600' title='20600'>'It may mean a long search, and we need not detain you. </span>
<span sid='20601' title='20601'>I fancy that we shall get our solution before morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20602' title='20602'>When John Mason had left us, Holmes set to work making a very careful examination of the graves, ranging from a very ancient one, which appeared to be Saxon, in the centre, through a long line of Norman Hugos and Odos, until we reached the Sir William and Sir Denis Falder of the eighteenth century. </span>
<span sid='20603' title='20603'>It was an hour or more before Holmes came to a leaden coffin standing on end before the entrance to the vault. </span>
<span sid='20604' title='20604'>I heard his little cry of satisfaction, and was aware from his hurried but purposeful movements that he had reached a goal. </span>
<span sid='20605' title='20605'>With his lens he was eagerly examining the edges of the heavy lid. </span>
<span sid='20606' title='20606'>Then he drew from his pocket a short jemmy, a box-opener, which he thrust into a chink, levering back the whole front, which seemed to be secured by only a couple of clamps. </span>
<span sid='20607' title='20607'>There was a rending, tearing sound as it gave way, but it had hardly hinged back and partly revealed the contents before we had an unforeseen interruption.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20608' title='20608'>Someone was walking in the chapel above. </span>
<span sid='20609' title='20609'>It was the firm, rapid step of one who came with a definite purpose and knew well the ground upon which he walked. </span>
<span sid='20610' title='20610'>A light streamed down the stairs, and an instant later the man who bore it was framed in the Gothic archway. </span>
<span sid='20611' title='20611'>He was a terrible figure, huge in stature and fierce in manner. </span>
<span sid='20612' title='20612'>A large stable-lantern which he held in front of him shone upwards upon a strong, heavily-moustached face and angry eyes, which glared round him into every recess of the vault, finally fixing themselves with a deadly stare upon my companion and myself.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20613' title='20613'>'Who the devil are you?' he thundered. </span>
<span sid='20614' title='20614'>'And what are you doing upon my property?' </span>
<span sid='20615' title='20615'>Then, as Holmes returned no answer, he took a couple of steps forward and raised a heavy stick which he carried. </span>
<span sid='20616' title='20616'>'Do you hear me?' he cried. </span>
<span sid='20617' title='20617'>'Who are you? </span>
<span sid='20618' title='20618'>What are you doing here?' </span>
<span sid='20619' title='20619'>His cudgel quivered in the air.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20620' title='20620'>But instead of shrinking, Holmes advanced to meet him. </span>
<span sid='20621' title='20621'>'I also have a question to ask you, Sir Robert,' he said in his sternest tone. </span>
<span sid='20622' title='20622'>'Who is this? </span>
<span sid='20623' title='20623'>And what is it doing here?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20624' title='20624'>He turned and tore open the coffin-lid behind him. </span>
<span sid='20625' title='20625'>In the glare of the lantern I saw a body swathed in a sheet from head to foot, with dreadful, witch-like features, all nose and chin, projecting at one end, the dim, glazed eyes staring from a discoloured and crumbling face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20626' title='20626'>The Baronet had staggered back with a cry and supported himself against a stone sarcophagus.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20627' title='20627'>'How came you to know of this?' he cried. </span>
<span sid='20628' title='20628'>And then, with some return of his truculent manner: </span>
<span sid='20629' title='20629'>'What business is it of yours?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20630' title='20630'>'My name is Sherlock Holmes,' said my companion. </span>
<span sid='20631' title='20631'>'Possibly it is familiar to you. </span>
<span sid='20632' title='20632'>In any case, my business is that of every other good citizen - to uphold the law. </span>
<span sid='20633' title='20633'>It seems to me that you have much to answer for.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20634' title='20634'>Sir Robert glared for a moment, but Holmes's quiet voice and cool, assured manner had their effect.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20635' title='20635'>'Fore God, Mr Holmes, it's all right,' said he. </span>
<span sid='20636' title='20636'>'Appearances are against me, I'll admit, but I could act no otherwise.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20637' title='20637'>'I should be happy to think so, but I fear your explanations must be for the police.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20638' title='20638'>Sir Robert shrugged his broad shoulders.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20639' title='20639'>'Well, if it must be, it must. </span>
<span sid='20640' title='20640'>Come up to the house and you can judge for yourself how the matter stands.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20641' title='20641'>A quarter of an hour later we found ourselves in what I judge, from the lines of polished barrels behind glass covers, to be the gun-room of the old house. </span>
<span sid='20642' title='20642'>It was comfortably furnished, and here Sir Robert left us for a few moments. </span>
<span sid='20643' title='20643'>When he returned he had two companions with him, the one, the florid young woman whom we had seen in the carriage, the other, a small rat-faced man with a disagreeably furtive manner. </span>
<span sid='20644' title='20644'>These two wore an appearance of utter bewilderment, which showed that the Baronet had not yet had time to explain to them the turn events had taken.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20645' title='20645'>'There', said Sir Robert, with a wave of his hand, 'are Mr and Mrs Norlett. </span>
<span sid='20646' title='20646'>Mrs Norlett, under her maiden name of Evans, has for some years been my sister's confidential maid. </span>
<span sid='20647' title='20647'>I have brought them here because I feel that my best course is to explain the true position to you, and they are the two people upon earth who can substantiate what I say.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20648' title='20648'>'Is this necessary, Sir Robert? </span>
<span sid='20649' title='20649'>Have you thought what you are doing?' cried the woman.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20650' title='20650'>'As to me, I entirely disclaim all responsibility,' said her husband.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20651' title='20651'>Sir Robert gave him a glance of contempt. </span>
<span sid='20652' title='20652'>'I will take all responsibility,' said he. </span>
<span sid='20653' title='20653'>'Now, Mr Holmes, listen to a plain statement of the facts.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20654' title='20654'>'You have clearly gone pretty deeply into my affairs or I should not have found you where I did. </span>
<span sid='20655' title='20655'>Therefore, you know already, in all probability, that I am running a dark horse for the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Derby&t=h'>Derby</a> and that everything depends upon my success. </span>
<span sid='20656' title='20656'>If I win, all is easy. </span>
<span sid='20657' title='20657'>If I lose - well, I dare not think of that!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20658' title='20658'>'I understand the position,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20659' title='20659'>'I am dependent upon my sister, Lady Beatrice, for everything. </span>
<span sid='20660' title='20660'>But it is well known that her interest in the estate is for her own life only. </span>
<span sid='20661' title='20661'>For myself, I am deeply in the hands of the Jews. </span>
<span sid='20662' title='20662'>I have always known that if my sister were to die my creditors would be on to my estate like a flock of vultures. </span>
<span sid='20663' title='20663'>Everything would be seized, my stables, my horses - everything. </span>
<span sid='20664' title='20664'>Well, Mr Holmes, my sister did die just a week ago.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20665' title='20665'>'And you told no one!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20666' title='20666'>'What could I do? </span>
<span sid='20667' title='20667'>Absolute ruin faced me. </span>
<span sid='20668' title='20668'>If I could stave things off for three weeks all would be well. </span>
<span sid='20669' title='20669'>Her maid's husband - this man here - is an actor. </span>
<span sid='20670' title='20670'>It came into our heads - it came into my head - that he could for that short period personate my sister. </span>
<span sid='20671' title='20671'>It was but a case of appearing daily in the carriage, for no one need enter her room save the maid. </span>
<span sid='20672' title='20672'>It was not difficult to arrange. </span>
<span sid='20673' title='20673'>My sister died of the dropsy which had long afflicted her.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20674' title='20674'>'That will be for a coroner to decide.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20675' title='20675'>'Her doctor would certify that for months her symptoms have threatened such an end.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20676' title='20676'>'Well, what did you do?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20677' title='20677'>'The body could not remain there. </span>
<span sid='20678' title='20678'>On the first night Norlett and I carried it out to the old well-house, which is now never used. </span>
<span sid='20679' title='20679'>We were followed, however, by her pet spaniel, which yapped continually at the door so I felt some safer place was needed. </span>
<span sid='20680' title='20680'>I got rid of the spaniel and we carried the body to the crypt of the church. </span>
<span sid='20681' title='20681'>There was no indignity or irreverence, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='20682' title='20682'>I do not feel that I have wronged the dead.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20683' title='20683'>'Your conduct seems to me inexcusable, Sir Robert.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20684' title='20684'>The Baronet shook his head impatiently 'It is easy to preach,' said he. </span>
<span sid='20685' title='20685'>'Perhaps you would have felt differently if you had been in my position. </span>
<span sid='20686' title='20686'>One cannot see all one's hopes and all one's plans shattered at the last moment and make no effort to save them. </span>
<span sid='20687' title='20687'>It seemed to me that it would be no unworthy resting-place if we put her for the time in one of the coffins of her husband's ancestors lying in what is still consecrated ground. </span>
<span sid='20688' title='20688'>We opened such a coffin, removed the contents, and placed her as you have seen her. </span>
<span sid='20689' title='20689'>As to the old relics which we took out, we could not leave them on the floor of the crypt. </span>
<span sid='20690' title='20690'>Norlett and I removed them, and he descended at night and burned them in the central furnace. </span>
<span sid='20691' title='20691'>There is my story, Mr Holmes, though how you forced my hand so that I have to tell it is more than I can say.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20692' title='20692'>Holmes sat for some time lost in thought.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20693' title='20693'>'There is one flaw in your narrative, Sir Robert,' he said at last. </span>
<span sid='20694' title='20694'>'Your bets on the race, and therefore your hopes for the future, would hold good even if your creditors seized your estate.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20695' title='20695'>'The horse would be part of the estate. </span>
<span sid='20696' title='20696'>What do they care for my bets? </span>
<span sid='20697' title='20697'>As likely as not they would not run him at all. </span>
<span sid='20698' title='20698'>My chief creditor is, unhappily, my most bitter enemy - a rascally fellow, Sam Brewer, whom I was once compelled to horsewhip on <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Newmarket Heath&t=h'>Newmarket Heath</a>. </span>
<span sid='20699' title='20699'>Do you suppose that he would try to save me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20700' title='20700'>'Well, Sir Robert,' said Holmes, rising, 'this matter must, of course, be referred to the police. </span>
<span sid='20701' title='20701'>It was my duty to bring the facts to light and there I must leave it. </span>
<span sid='20702' title='20702'>As to the morality or decency of your own conduct, it is not for me to express an opinion. </span>
<span sid='20703' title='20703'>It is nearly midnight, Watson, and I think we may make our way back to our humble abode.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20704' title='20704'>It is generally known now that this singular episode ended upon a happier note than Sir Robert's actions deserved. </span>
<span sid='20705' title='20705'>Shoscombe Prince did win the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Derby&t=h'>Derby</a>, the sporting owner did net eighty thousand pounds in bets, and the creditors did hold their hand until the race was over, when they were paid in full, and enough was left to re-establish Sir Robert in a fair position in life. </span>
<span sid='20706' title='20706'>Both police and coroner took a lenient view of the transaction, and beyond a mild censure for the delay in registering the lady's decease, the lucky owner got away scatheless from this strange incident in a career which has now outlived its shadows and promises to end in an honoured old age.</span>
