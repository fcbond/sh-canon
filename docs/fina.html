<p>
<span sid='18526' title='18526'>It is with a heavy heart that I take up my pen to write these the last words in which I shall ever record the singular gifts by which my friend Mr Sherlock Holmes was distinguished. </span>
<span sid='18527' title='18527'>In an incoherent and, as I deeply feel, an entirely inadequate fashion, I have endeavoured to give some account of my strange experiences in his company from the chance which first brought us together at the period of the 'Study in Scarlet', up to the time of his interference in the matter of the 'Naval Treaty' - an interference which had the unquestionable effect of preventing a serious international complication. </span>
<span sid='18528' title='18528'>It was my intention to have stopped there, and to have said nothing of that event which has created a void in my life which the lapse of two years has done little to fill. </span>
<span sid='18529' title='18529'>My hand has been forced, however, by the recent letters in which Colonel James Moriarty defends the memory of his brother, and I have no choice but to lay the facts before the public exactly as they occurred. </span>
<span sid='18530' title='18530'>I alone know the absolute truth of the matter, and I am satisfied that the time has come when no good purpose is to be served by its suppression. </span>
<span sid='18531' title='18531'>As far as I know, there have been only three accounts in the public Press: that in the Journal de Genève upon May 6th, 1891, the Reuter's despatch in the English papers upon May 7th, and finally the recent letters to which I have alluded. </span>
<span sid='18532' title='18532'>Of these the first and second were extremely condensed, while the last is, as I shall now show, an absolute perversion of the facts. </span>
<span sid='18533' title='18533'>It lies with me to tell for the first time what really took place between Professor Moriarty and Mr Sherlock Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18534' title='18534'>It may be remembered that after my marriage, and my subsequent start in private practice, the very intimate relations which had existed between Holmes and myself became to some extent modified. </span>
<span sid='18535' title='18535'>He still came to me from time to time when he desired a companion in his investigations, but these occasions grew more and more seldom, until I find that in the year 1890 there were only three cases of which I retain any record. </span>
<span sid='18536' title='18536'>During the winter of that year and the early spring of 1891, I saw in the papers that he had been engaged by the French Government upon a matter of supreme importance, and I received two notes from Holmes, dated from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Narbonne&t=h'>Narbonne</a> and from Nîmes, from which I gathered that his stay in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a> was likely to be a long one. </span>
<span sid='18537' title='18537'>It was with some surprise, therefore, that I saw him walk into my consulting-room upon the evening of the 24th of April. </span>
<span sid='18538' title='18538'>It struck me that he was looking even paler and thinner than usual.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18539' title='18539'>'Yes, I have been using myself up rather too freely,' he remarked, in answer to my look rather than to my words; 'I have been a little pressed of late. </span>
<span sid='18540' title='18540'>Have you any objection to my closing your shutters?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18541' title='18541'>The only light in the room came from the lamp upon the table at which I had been reading. </span>
<span sid='18542' title='18542'>Holmes edged his way round the wall, and flinging the shutters together, he bolted them securely.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18543' title='18543'>'You are afraid of something?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18544' title='18544'>'Well, I am.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18545' title='18545'>'Of what?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18546' title='18546'>'Of air-guns.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18547' title='18547'>'My dear Holmes, what do you mean?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18548' title='18548'>'I think that you know me well enough, Watson, to understand that I am by no means a nervous man. </span>
<span sid='18549' title='18549'>At the same time, it is stupidity rather than courage to refuse to recognise danger when it is close upon you. </span>
<span sid='18550' title='18550'>Might I trouble you for a match?' </span>
<span sid='18551' title='18551'>He drew in the smoke of his cigarette as if the soothing influence was grateful to him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18552' title='18552'>'I must apologize for calling so late,' said he, 'and I must further beg you to be so unconventional as to allow me to leave your house presently by scrambling over your back garden wall.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18553' title='18553'>'But what does it all mean?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18554' title='18554'>He held out his hand, and I saw in the light of the lamp that two of his knuckles were burst and bleeding.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18555' title='18555'>'It's not an airy nothing, you see,' said he, smiling. </span>
<span sid='18556' title='18556'>'On the contrary, it is solid enough for a man to break his hand over. </span>
<span sid='18557' title='18557'>Is Mrs Watson in?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18558' title='18558'>'She is away upon a visit.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18559' title='18559'>'Indeed! </span>
<span sid='18560' title='18560'>You are alone?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18561' title='18561'>'Quite.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18562' title='18562'>'Then it makes it the easier for me to propose that you should come away with me for a week on to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Continent&t=h'>the Continent</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18563' title='18563'>'Where?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18564' title='18564'>'Oh, anywhere. </span>
<span sid='18565' title='18565'>It's all the same to me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18566' title='18566'>There was something very strange in all this. </span>
<span sid='18567' title='18567'>It was not Holmes's nature to take an aimless holiday, and something about his pale, worn face told me that his nerves were at their highest tension. </span>
<span sid='18568' title='18568'>He saw the question in my eyes, and, putting his finger-tips together and his elbows upon his knees, he explained the situation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18569' title='18569'>'You have probably never heard of Professor Moriarty?' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18570' title='18570'>'Never.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18571' title='18571'>'Aye, there's the genius and the wonder of the thing!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='18572' title='18572'>'The man pervades <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, and no one has heard of him. </span>
<span sid='18573' title='18573'>That's what puts him on a pinnacle in the records of crime. </span>
<span sid='18574' title='18574'>I tell you, Watson, in all seriousness, that if I could beat that man, if I could free society of him, I should feel that my own career had reached its summit, and I should be prepared to turn to some more placid line in life. </span>
<span sid='18575' title='18575'>Between ourselves, the recent cases in which I have been of assistance to the Royal Family of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scandinavia&t=h'>Scandinavia</a>, and to the French Republic, have left me in such a position that I could continue to live in the quiet fashion which is most congenial to me, and to concentrate my attention upon my chemical researches. </span>
<span sid='18576' title='18576'>But I could not rest, Watson, I could not sit quiet in my chair, if I thought that such a man as Professor Moriarty were walking the streets of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> unchallenged.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18577' title='18577'>'What has he done, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18578' title='18578'>'His career has been an extraordinary one. </span>
<span sid='18579' title='18579'>He is a man of good birth and excellent education, endowed by Nature with a phenomenal mathematical faculty. </span>
<span sid='18580' title='18580'>At the age of twenty-one he wrote a treatise upon the Binomial Theorem, which has had a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>an vogue. </span>
<span sid='18581' title='18581'>On the strength of it, he won the Mathematical Chair at one of our smaller Universities, and had, to all appearance, a most brilliant career before him. </span>
<span sid='18582' title='18582'>But the man had hereditary tendencies of the most diabolical kind. </span>
<span sid='18583' title='18583'>A criminal strain ran in his blood, which, instead of being modified, was increased and rendered infinitely more dangerous by his extraordinary mental powers. </span>
<span sid='18584' title='18584'>Dark rumours gathered round him in the University town, and eventually he was compelled to resign his Chair and to come down to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, where he set up as an army coach. </span>
<span sid='18585' title='18585'>So much is known to the world, but what I am telling you now is what I have myself discovered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18586' title='18586'>'As you are aware, Watson, there is no one who knows the higher criminal world of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> so well as I do. </span>
<span sid='18587' title='18587'>For years past I have continually been conscious of some power behind the malefactor, some deep organizing power which for ever stands in the way of the law, and throws its shield over the wrong-doer. </span>
<span sid='18588' title='18588'>Again and again in cases of the most varying sorts - forgery cases, robberies, murders - I have felt the presence of this force, and I have deduced its action in many of those undiscovered crimes in which I have not been personally consulted. </span>
<span sid='18589' title='18589'>For years I have endeavoured to break through the veil which shrouded it, and at last the time came when I seized my thread and followed it, until it led me, after a thousand cunning windings, to ex-Professor Moriarty of mathematical celebrity.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18590' title='18590'>'He is the Napoleon of crime, Watson. </span>
<span sid='18591' title='18591'>He is the organizer of half that is evil and of nearly all that is undetected in this great city. </span>
<span sid='18592' title='18592'>He is a genius, a philosopher, an abstract thinker. </span>
<span sid='18593' title='18593'>He has a brain of the first order. </span>
<span sid='18594' title='18594'>He sits motionless, like a spider in the centre of its web, but that web has a thousand radiations, and he knows well every quiver of each of them. </span>
<span sid='18595' title='18595'>He does little himself. </span>
<span sid='18596' title='18596'>He only plans. </span>
<span sid='18597' title='18597'>But his agents are numerous and splendidly organized. </span>
<span sid='18598' title='18598'>Is there a crime to be done, a paper to be abstracted, we will say, a house to be rifled, a man to be removed - the word is passed to the Professor, the matter is organized and carried out. </span>
<span sid='18599' title='18599'>The agent may be caught. </span>
<span sid='18600' title='18600'>In that case money is found for his bail or his defence. </span>
<span sid='18601' title='18601'>But the central power which uses the agent is never caught - never so much as suspected. </span>
<span sid='18602' title='18602'>This was the organization which I deduced, Watson, and which I devoted my whole energy to exposing and breaking up.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18603' title='18603'>'But the Professor was fenced round with safeguards so cunningly devised that, do what I would, it seemed impossible to get evidence which could convict in a court of law. </span>
<span sid='18604' title='18604'>You know my powers, my dear Watson, and yet at the end of three months I was forced to confess that I had at last met an antagonist who was my intellectual equal. </span>
<span sid='18605' title='18605'>My horror at his crimes was lost in my admiration at his skill. </span>
<span sid='18606' title='18606'>But at last he made a trip - only a little, little trip - but it was more than he could afford, when I was so close upon him. </span>
<span sid='18607' title='18607'>I had my chance, and, starting from that point, I have woven my net round him until now it is all ready to close. </span>
<span sid='18608' title='18608'>In three days, that is to say on Monday next, matters will be ripe, and the Professor, with all the principal members of his gang, will be in the hands of the police. </span>
<span sid='18609' title='18609'>Then will come the greatest criminal trial of the century, the clearing up of over forty mysteries, and the rope for all of them - but if we move at all prematurely, you understand, they may slip out of our hands even at the last moment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18610' title='18610'>'Now, if I could have done this without the knowledge of Professor Moriarty, all would have been well. </span>
<span sid='18611' title='18611'>But he was too wily for that. </span>
<span sid='18612' title='18612'>He saw every step which I took to draw my toils round him. </span>
<span sid='18613' title='18613'>Again and again he strove to break away, but I as often headed him off. </span>
<span sid='18614' title='18614'>I tell you, my friend, that if a detailed account of that silent contest could be written, it would take its place as the most brilliant bit of thrust-andparry work in the history of detection. </span>
<span sid='18615' title='18615'>Never have I risen to such a height, and never have I been so hard pressed by an opponent. </span>
<span sid='18616' title='18616'>He cut deep, and yet I just undercut him. </span>
<span sid='18617' title='18617'>This morning the last steps were taken, and three days only were wanted to complete the business. </span>
<span sid='18618' title='18618'>I was sitting in my room thinking the matter over, when the door opened and Professor Moriarty stood before me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18619' title='18619'>'My nerves are fairly proof, Watson, but I must confess to a start when I saw the very man who had been so much in my thoughts standing there on my threshold. </span>
<span sid='18620' title='18620'>His appearance was quite familiar to me. </span>
<span sid='18621' title='18621'>He is extremely tall and thin, his forehead domes out in a white curve, and his two eyes are deeply sunken in his head. </span>
<span sid='18622' title='18622'>He is clean-shaven, pale, and ascetic-looking, retaining something of the professor in his features. </span>
<span sid='18623' title='18623'>His shoulders are rounded from much study, and his face protrudes forward, and is for ever slowly oscillating from side to side in a curiously reptilian fashion. </span>
<span sid='18624' title='18624'>He peered at me with great curiosity in his puckered eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18625' title='18625'>'"You have less frontal development than I should have expected," said he at last. </span>
<span sid='18626' title='18626'>"It is a dangerous habit to finger loaded firearms in the pocket of one's dressing-gown."</span>
<p>
<span sid='18627' title='18627'>'The fact is that upon his entrance I had instantly recognised the extreme personal danger in which I lay. </span>
<span sid='18628' title='18628'>The only conceivable escape for him lay in silencing my tongue. </span>
<span sid='18629' title='18629'>In an instant I had slipped the revolver from the drawer into my pocket, and was covering him through the cloth. </span>
<span sid='18630' title='18630'>At his remark I drew the weapon out and laid it cocked upon the table. </span>
<span sid='18631' title='18631'>He still smiled and blinked but there was something about his eyes which made me feel very glad that I had it there.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18632' title='18632'>'"You evidently don't know me," said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18633' title='18633'>'"On the contrary," I answered, "I think it is fairly evident that I do. </span>
<span sid='18634' title='18634'>Pray take a chair. </span>
<span sid='18635' title='18635'>I can spare you five minutes if you have anything to say."</span>
<p>
<span sid='18636' title='18636'>'"All that I have to say has already crossed your mind," said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18637' title='18637'>'"Then possibly my answer has crossed yours," I replied.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18638' title='18638'>'"You stand fast?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='18639' title='18639'>'"Absolutely."</span>
<p>
<span sid='18640' title='18640'>'He clapped his hand into his pocket, and I raised the pistol from the table. </span>
<span sid='18641' title='18641'>But he merely drew out a memorandum-book in which he had scribbled some dates.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18642' title='18642'>'"You crossed my path on the 4th of January," said he. </span>
<span sid='18643' title='18643'>"On the 23rd you incommoded me; by the middle of February I was seriously inconvenienced by you; at the end of March I was absolutely hampered in my plans; and now, at the close of April, I find myself placed in such a position through your continual persecution that I am in positive danger of losing my liberty. </span>
<span sid='18644' title='18644'>The situation is becoming an impossible one."</span>
<p>
<span sid='18645' title='18645'>'"Have you any suggestion to make?" I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18646' title='18646'>'"You must drop it, Mr Holmes," said he, swaying his face about. </span>
<span sid='18647' title='18647'>"You really must, you know."</span>
<p>
<span sid='18648' title='18648'>'"After Monday," said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18649' title='18649'>'"Tut, tut!" said he. </span>
<span sid='18650' title='18650'>"I am quite sure that a man of your intelligence will see that there can be but one outcome to this affair. </span>
<span sid='18651' title='18651'>It is necessary that you should withdraw. </span>
<span sid='18652' title='18652'>You have worked things in such a fashion that we have only one resource left. </span>
<span sid='18653' title='18653'>It has been an intellectual treat to me to see the way in which you have grappled with this affair, and I say, unaffectedly, that it would be a grief to me to be forced to take any extreme measure. </span>
<span sid='18654' title='18654'>You smile, sir, but I assure you that it really would."</span>
<p>
<span sid='18655' title='18655'>'"Danger is part of my trade," I remarked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18656' title='18656'>'"This is not danger," said he. </span>
<span sid='18657' title='18657'>"It is inevitable destruction. </span>
<span sid='18658' title='18658'>You stand in the way not merely of an individual, but of a mighty organization, the full extent of which you, with all your cleverness, have been unable to realize. </span>
<span sid='18659' title='18659'>You must stand clear, Mr Holmes, or be trodden under foot."</span>
<p>
<span sid='18660' title='18660'>'"I am afraid," said I, rising, "that in the pleasure of this conversation I am neglecting business of importance which awaits me elsewhere."</span>
<p>
<span sid='18661' title='18661'>'He rose also and looked at me in silence, shaking his head sadly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18662' title='18662'>'"Well, well," said he at last. </span>
<span sid='18663' title='18663'>"It seems a pity, but I have done what I could. </span>
<span sid='18664' title='18664'>I know every move of your game. </span>
<span sid='18665' title='18665'>You can do nothing before Monday. </span>
<span sid='18666' title='18666'>It has been a duel between you and me, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='18667' title='18667'>You hope to place me in the dock. </span>
<span sid='18668' title='18668'>I tell you that I will never stand in the dock. </span>
<span sid='18669' title='18669'>You hope to beat me. </span>
<span sid='18670' title='18670'>I tell you that you will never beat me. </span>
<span sid='18671' title='18671'>If you are clever enough to bring destruction upon me, rest assured that I shall do as much to you."</span>
<p>
<span sid='18672' title='18672'>'"You have paid me several compliments, Mr Moriarty," said I. </span>
<span sid='18673' title='18673'>"Let me pay you one in return when I say that if I were assured of the former eventuality I would, in the interests of the public, cheerfully accept the latter."</span>
<p>
<span sid='18674' title='18674'>'"I can promise you the one but not the other," he snarled, and so turned his rounded back upon me and went peering and blinking out of the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18675' title='18675'>'That was my singular interview with Professor Moriarty. </span>
<span sid='18676' title='18676'>I confess that it left an unpleasant effect upon my mind. </span>
<span sid='18677' title='18677'>His soft, precise fashion of speech leaves a conviction of sincerity which a mere bully could not produce. </span>
<span sid='18678' title='18678'>Of course, you will say: "Why not take police precautions against him?" </span>
<span sid='18679' title='18679'>The reason is that I am well convinced that it is from his agents the blow would fall. </span>
<span sid='18680' title='18680'>I have the best of proofs that it would be so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18681' title='18681'>'You have already been assaulted?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18682' title='18682'>'My dear Watson, Professor Moriarty is not a man who lets the grass grow under his feet. </span>
<span sid='18683' title='18683'>I went out about midday to transact some business in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Oxford Street&t=h'>Oxford Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='18684' title='18684'>As I passed the corner which leads from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bentinck Street&t=h'>Bentinck Street</a> on to the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Welbeck Street&t=h'>Welbeck Street</a> crossing, a two-horse van furiously driven whizzed round and was on me like a flash. </span>
<span sid='18685' title='18685'>I sprang for the footpath and saved myself by the fraction of a second. </span>
<span sid='18686' title='18686'>The van dashed round by <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Marylebone Lane&t=h'>Marylebone Lane</a> and was gone in an instant. </span>
<span sid='18687' title='18687'>I kept to the pavement after that, Watson, but as I walked down <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Vere Street&t=h'>Vere Street</a> a brick came down from the roof of one of the houses and was shattered to fragments at my feet. </span>
<span sid='18688' title='18688'>I called the police and had the place examined. </span>
<span sid='18689' title='18689'>There were slates and bricks piled upon the roof preparatory to some repairs, and they would have me believe that the wind had toppled over one of these. </span>
<span sid='18690' title='18690'>Of course I knew better, but I could prove nothing. </span>
<span sid='18691' title='18691'>I took a cab after that and reached my brother's rooms in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pall Mall&t=h'>Pall Mall</a>, where I spent the day. </span>
<span sid='18692' title='18692'>Now I have come round to you, and on my way I was attacked by a rough with a bludgeon. </span>
<span sid='18693' title='18693'>I knocked him down, and the police have him in custody; but I can tell you with the most absolute confidence that no possible connection will ever be traced between the gentleman upon whose front teeth I have barked my knuckles and the retiring mathematical coach, who is, I dare say, working out problems upon a blackboard ten miles away. </span>
<span sid='18694' title='18694'>You will not wonder, Watson, that my first act on entering your rooms was to close your shutters, and that I have been compelled to ask your permission to leave the house by some less conspicuous exit than the front door.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18695' title='18695'>I had often admired my friend's courage, but never more than now, as he sat quietly checking off a series of incidents which must have combined to make up a day of horror.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18696' title='18696'>'You will spend the night here?' I said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18697' title='18697'>'No, my friend, you might find me a dangerous guest. </span>
<span sid='18698' title='18698'>I have my plans laid, and all will be well. </span>
<span sid='18699' title='18699'>Matters have gone so far now that they can move without my help as far as the arrest goes, though my presence is necessary for a conviction. </span>
<span sid='18700' title='18700'>It is obvious, therefore, than I cannot do better than get away for the few days which remain before the police are at liberty to act. </span>
<span sid='18701' title='18701'>It would be a great pleasure to me, therefore, if you could come on to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Continent&t=h'>the Continent</a> with me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18702' title='18702'>'The practice is quiet,' said I, 'and I have an accommodating neighbour. </span>
<span sid='18703' title='18703'>I should be glad to come.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18704' title='18704'>'And to start to-morrow morning?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18705' title='18705'>'If necessary.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18706' title='18706'>'Oh, yes, it is most necessary. </span>
<span sid='18707' title='18707'>Then these are your instructions, and I beg, my dear Watson, that you will obey them to the letter, for you are now playing a double-handed game with me against the cleverest rogue and the most powerful syndicate of criminals in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>. </span>
<span sid='18708' title='18708'>Now listen! </span>
<span sid='18709' title='18709'>You will dispatch whatever luggage you intend to take by a trusty messenger unaddressed to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Victoria&t=h'>Victoria</a> to-night. </span>
<span sid='18710' title='18710'>In the morning you will send for a hansom, desiring your man to take neither the first nor the second which may present itself. </span>
<span sid='18711' title='18711'>Into this hansom you will jump, and you will drive to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Strand&t=h'>the Strand</a> end of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lowther Arcade&t=h'>Lowther Arcade</a>, handing the address to the cabman upon a slip of paper, with a request that he will not throw it away. </span>
<span sid='18712' title='18712'>Have your fare ready, and the instant that your cab stops, dash through the Arcade, timing yourself to reach the other side at a quarter-past nine. </span>
<span sid='18713' title='18713'>You will find a small brougham waiting close to the kerb, driven by a fellow with a heavy black cloak tipped at the collar with red. </span>
<span sid='18714' title='18714'>Into this you will step, and you will reach <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Victoria&t=h'>Victoria</a> in time for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Continent&t=h'>the Continent</a>al express.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18715' title='18715'>'Where shall I meet you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18716' title='18716'>'At the station. </span>
<span sid='18717' title='18717'>The second first-class carriage from the front will be reserved for us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18718' title='18718'>'The carriage is our rendezvous, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18719' title='18719'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18720' title='18720'>It was in vain that I asked Holmes to remain for the evening. </span>
<span sid='18721' title='18721'>It was evident to me that he thought he might bring trouble to the roof he was under, and that that was the motive which impelled him to go. </span>
<span sid='18722' title='18722'>With a few hurried words as to our plans for the morrow he rose and came out with me into the garden, clambering over the wall which leads into <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Mortimer Street&t=h'>Mortimer Street</a>, and immediately whistling for a hansom, in which I heard him drive away.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18723' title='18723'>In the morning I obeyed Holmes's injunctions to the letter. </span>
<span sid='18724' title='18724'>A hansom was procured with such precautions as would prevent its being one which was placed ready for us, and I drove immediately after breakfast to the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lowther Arcade&t=h'>Lowther Arcade</a>, through which I hurried at the top of my speed. </span>
<span sid='18725' title='18725'>A brougham was waiting with a very massive driver wrapped in a dark cloak, who, the instant that I had stepped in, whipped up the horse and rattled off to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Victoria&t=h'>Victoria</a> Station. </span>
<span sid='18726' title='18726'>On my alighting there he turned the carriage, and dashed away again without so much as a look in my direction.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18727' title='18727'>So far all had gone admirably. </span>
<span sid='18728' title='18728'>My luggage was waiting for me, and I had no difficulty in finding the carriage which Holmes had indicated, the less so as it was the only one in the train which was marked 'Engaged'. </span>
<span sid='18729' title='18729'>My only source of anxiety now was the non-appearance of Holmes. </span>
<span sid='18730' title='18730'>The station clock marked only seven minutes from the time when we were due to start. </span>
<span sid='18731' title='18731'>In vain I searched among the groups of travellers and leave-takers for the lithe figure of my friend. </span>
<span sid='18732' title='18732'>There was no sign of him. </span>
<span sid='18733' title='18733'>I spent a few minutes in assisting a venerable Italian priest, who was endeavouring to make a porter understand, in his broken English, that his luggage was to be booked through to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Paris&t=h'>Paris</a>. </span>
<span sid='18734' title='18734'>Then, having taken another look round, I returned to my carriage, where I found that the porter, in spite of the ticket, had given me my decrepit Italian friend as a travelling companion. </span>
<span sid='18735' title='18735'>It was useless for me to explain to him that his presence was an intrusion, for my Italian was even more limited than his English, so I shrugged my shoulders resignedly and continued to look out anxiously for my friend. </span>
<span sid='18736' title='18736'>A chill of fear had come over me, as I thought that his absence might mean that some blow had fallen during the night. </span>
<span sid='18737' title='18737'>Already the doors had all been shut and the whistle blown, when - 'My dear Watson,' said a voice, 'you have not even condescended to say good morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18738' title='18738'>I turned in incontrollable astonishment. </span>
<span sid='18739' title='18739'>The aged ecclesiastic had turned his face towards me. </span>
<span sid='18740' title='18740'>For an instant the wrinkles were smoothed away, the nose drew away from the chin, the lower lip ceased to protrude and the mouth to mumble, the dull eyes regained their fire, the drooping figure expanded. </span>
<span sid='18741' title='18741'>The next the whole frame collapsed again, and Holmes had gone as quickly as he had come.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18742' title='18742'>'Good heavens!' I cried. </span>
<span sid='18743' title='18743'>'How you startled me!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18744' title='18744'>'Every precaution is still necessary,' he whispered. </span>
<span sid='18745' title='18745'>'I have reason to think that they are hot upon our trail. </span>
<span sid='18746' title='18746'>Ah, there is Moriarty himself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18747' title='18747'>The train had already begun to move as Holmes spoke. </span>
<span sid='18748' title='18748'>Glancing back I saw a tall man pushing his way furiously through the crowd and waving his hand as if he desired to have the train stopped. </span>
<span sid='18749' title='18749'>It was too late, however, for we were rapidly gathering momentum, and an instant later had shot clear of the station.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18750' title='18750'>'With all our precautions, you see that we have cut it rather fine,' said Holmes, laughing. </span>
<span sid='18751' title='18751'>He rose, and throwing off the black cassock and hat which had formed his disguise, he packed them away in a hand-bag.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18752' title='18752'>'Have you seen the morning paper, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18753' title='18753'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18754' title='18754'>'You haven't seen about <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18755' title='18755'>'<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18756' title='18756'>'They set fire to our rooms last night. </span>
<span sid='18757' title='18757'>No great harm was done.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18758' title='18758'>'Good heavens, Holmes! </span>
<span sid='18759' title='18759'>This is intolerable.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18760' title='18760'>'They must have lost my track completely after their bludgeon-man was arrested. </span>
<span sid='18761' title='18761'>Otherwise they could not have imagined that I had returned to my rooms. </span>
<span sid='18762' title='18762'>They have evidently taken the precaution of watching you, however, and that is what has brought Moriarty to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Victoria&t=h'>Victoria</a>. </span>
<span sid='18763' title='18763'>You could not have made any slip in coming?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18764' title='18764'>'I did exactly what you advised.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18765' title='18765'>'Did you find your brougham?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18766' title='18766'>'Yes, it was waiting.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18767' title='18767'>'Did you recognize your coachman?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18768' title='18768'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18769' title='18769'>'It was my brother Mycroft. </span>
<span sid='18770' title='18770'>It is an advantage to get about in such a case without taking a mercenary into your confidence. </span>
<span sid='18771' title='18771'>But we must plan what we are to do about Moriarty now.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18772' title='18772'>'As this is an express, and as the boat runs in connection with it, I should think we have shaken him off very effectively.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18773' title='18773'>'My dear Watson, you evidently did not realize my meaning when I said that this man may be taken as being quite on the same intellectual plane as myself. </span>
<span sid='18774' title='18774'>You do not imagine that if I were the pursuer I should allow myself to be baffled by so slight an obstacle. </span>
<span sid='18775' title='18775'>Why, then, should you think so meanly of him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18776' title='18776'>'What will he do?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18777' title='18777'>'What I should do.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18778' title='18778'>'What would you do, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18779' title='18779'>'Engage a special.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18780' title='18780'>'But it must be late.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18781' title='18781'>'By no means. </span>
<span sid='18782' title='18782'>This train stops at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Canterbury&t=h'>Canterbury</a>; and there is always at least a quarter of an hour's delay at the boat. </span>
<span sid='18783' title='18783'>He will catch us there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18784' title='18784'>'One would think that we were the criminals. </span>
<span sid='18785' title='18785'>Let us have him arrested on his arrival.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18786' title='18786'>'It would be to ruin the work of three months. </span>
<span sid='18787' title='18787'>We should get the big fish, but the smaller would dart right and left out of the net. </span>
<span sid='18788' title='18788'>On Monday we should have them all. </span>
<span sid='18789' title='18789'>No, an arrest is inadmissible.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18790' title='18790'>'What then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18791' title='18791'>'We shall get out at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Canterbury&t=h'>Canterbury</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18792' title='18792'>'And then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18793' title='18793'>'Well, then we must make a cross-country journey to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Newhaven&t=h'>Newhaven</a>, and so over to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Dieppe&t=h'>Dieppe</a>. </span>
<span sid='18794' title='18794'>Moriarty will again do what I should do. </span>
<span sid='18795' title='18795'>He will get on to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Paris&t=h'>Paris</a>, mark down our luggage, and wait for two days at the depôt. </span>
<span sid='18796' title='18796'>In the meantime we shall treat ourselves to a couple of carpet bags, encourage the manufactures of the countries through which we travel, and make our way at our leisure into <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Switzerland&t=h'>Switzerland</a>, via <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Luxembourg&t=h'>Luxembourg</a> and <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Basle&t=h'>Basle</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18797' title='18797'>I am too old a traveller to allow myself to be seriously inconvenienced by the loss of my luggage, but I confess that I was annoyed at the idea of being forced to dodge and hide before a man whose record was black with unutterable infamies. </span>
<span sid='18798' title='18798'>It was evident, however, that Holmes understood the situation more clearly than I did. </span>
<span sid='18799' title='18799'>At <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Canterbury&t=h'>Canterbury</a>, therefore, we alighted, only to find that we should have to wait an hour before we could get a train to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Newhaven&t=h'>Newhaven</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18800' title='18800'>I was still looking rather ruefully after the rapidly disappearing luggage van which contained my wardrobe, when Holmes pulled my sleeve and pointed up the line.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18801' title='18801'>'Already, you see,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18802' title='18802'>Far away from among the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kent&t=h'>Kent</a>ish woods there arose a thin spray of smoke. </span>
<span sid='18803' title='18803'>A minute later a carriage and engine could be seen flying along the open curve which leads to the station. </span>
<span sid='18804' title='18804'>We had hardly time to take our places behind a pile of luggage when it passed with a rattle and a roar, beating a blast of hot air into our faces.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18805' title='18805'>'There he goes,' said Holmes, as we watched the carriage swing and rock over the points. </span>
<span sid='18806' title='18806'>'There are limits, you see, to our friend's intelligence. </span>
<span sid='18807' title='18807'>It would have been a coup-de-maître had he deduced what I would deduce and acted accordingly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18808' title='18808'>'And what would he have done had he overtaken us?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18809' title='18809'>'There cannot be the least doubt that he would have made a murderous attack upon me. </span>
<span sid='18810' title='18810'>It is, however, a game at which two may play. </span>
<span sid='18811' title='18811'>The question now is whether we should take a premature lunch here, or run our chance of starving before we reach the buffet at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Newhaven&t=h'>Newhaven</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18812' title='18812'>We made our way to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brussels&t=h'>Brussels</a> that night and spent two days there, moving on upon the third day as far as Strasburg. </span>
<span sid='18813' title='18813'>On the Monday morning Holmes had telegraphed to the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> police, and in the evening we found a reply waiting for us at our hotel. </span>
<span sid='18814' title='18814'>Holmes tore it open, and then with a bitter curse hurled it into the grate.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18815' title='18815'>'I might have known it,' he groaned. </span>
<span sid='18816' title='18816'>'He has escaped!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18817' title='18817'>'Moriarty!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18818' title='18818'>'They have secured the whole gang with the exception of him. </span>
<span sid='18819' title='18819'>He has given them the slip. </span>
<span sid='18820' title='18820'>Of course, when I had left the country there was no one to cope with him. </span>
<span sid='18821' title='18821'>But I did think that I had put the game in their hands. </span>
<span sid='18822' title='18822'>I think that you had better return to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, Watson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18823' title='18823'>'Why?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18824' title='18824'>'Because you will find me a dangerous companion now. </span>
<span sid='18825' title='18825'>This man's occupation is gone. </span>
<span sid='18826' title='18826'>He is lost if returns to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='18827' title='18827'>If I read his character right he will devote his whole energies to revenging himself upon me. </span>
<span sid='18828' title='18828'>He said as much in our short interview, and I fancy that he meant it. </span>
<span sid='18829' title='18829'>I should certainly recommend you to return to your practice.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18830' title='18830'>It was hardly an appeal to be successful with one who was an old campaigner as well as an old friend. </span>
<span sid='18831' title='18831'>We sat in the Strasburg salle-à-manger arguing the question for half an hour, but the same night we had resumed our journey and were well on our way to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Geneva&t=h'>Geneva</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18832' title='18832'>For a charming week we wandered up the Valley of the Rhône, and then, branching off at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Leuk&t=h'>Leuk</a>, we made our way over the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Gemmi Pass&t=h'>Gemmi Pass</a>, still deep in snow, and so, by way of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Interlaken&t=h'>Interlaken</a>, to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Meiringen&t=h'>Meiringen</a>. </span>
<span sid='18833' title='18833'>It was a lovely trip, the dainty green of the spring below, the virgin white of the winter above; but it was clear to me that never for one instant did Holmes forget the shadow which lay across him. </span>
<span sid='18834' title='18834'>In the homely Alpine villages or in the lonely mountain passes, I could still tell, by his quick glancing eyes and his sharp scrutiny of every face that passed us, that he was well convinced that, walk where we would, we could not walk ourselves clear of the danger which was dogging our footsteps.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18835' title='18835'>Once, I remember, as we passed over the Gemmi, and walked along the border of the melancholy Daubensee, a large rock which had been dislodged from the ridge upon our right clattered down and roared into the lake behind us. </span>
<span sid='18836' title='18836'>In an instant Holmes had raced up on to the ridge, and, standing upon a lofty pinnacle, craned his neck in every direction. </span>
<span sid='18837' title='18837'>It was in vain that our guide assured him that a fall of stones was a common chance in the spring-time at that spot. </span>
<span sid='18838' title='18838'>He said nothing, but he smiled at me with the air of a man who sees the fulfilment of that which he had expected.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18839' title='18839'>And yet for all his watchfulness he was never depressed. </span>
<span sid='18840' title='18840'>On the contrary, I can never recollect having seen him in such exuberant spirits. </span>
<span sid='18841' title='18841'>Again and again he recurred to the fact that if he could be assured that society was freed from Professor Moriarty, he would cheerfully bring his own career to a conclusion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18842' title='18842'>'I think that I may go so far as to say, Watson, that I have not lived wholly in vain,' he remarked. </span>
<span sid='18843' title='18843'>'If my record were closed to-night I could still survey it with equanimity. </span>
<span sid='18844' title='18844'>The air of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> is the sweeter for my presence. </span>
<span sid='18845' title='18845'>In over a thousand cases I am not aware that I have ever used my powers upon the wrong side. </span>
<span sid='18846' title='18846'>Of late I have been tempted to look into the problems furnished by Nature rather than those more superficial ones for which our artificial state of society is responsible. </span>
<span sid='18847' title='18847'>Your memoirs will draw to an end, Watson, upon the day that I crown my career by the capture or extinction of the most dangerous and capable criminal in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18848' title='18848'>I shall be brief, and yet exact, in the little which remains for me to tell. </span>
<span sid='18849' title='18849'>It is not a subject on which I would willingly dwell, and yet I am conscious that a duty devolves upon me to omit no detail.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18850' title='18850'>It was upon the 3rd of May that we reached the little village of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Meiringen&t=h'>Meiringen</a>, where we put up at the Englischer Hof, then kept by Peter Steiler the elder. </span>
<span sid='18851' title='18851'>Our landlord was an intelligent man, and spoke excellent English, having served for three years as waiter at the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Grosvenor Hotel&t=h'>Grosvenor Hotel</a> in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='18852' title='18852'>At his advice, upon the afternoon of the 4th we set off together with the intention of crossing the hills and spending the night at the hamlet of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Rosenlaui&t=h'>Rosenlaui</a>. </span>
<span sid='18853' title='18853'>We had strict injunctions, however, on no account to pass the falls of Reichenbach, which are about half-way up the hill, without making a small detour to see them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18854' title='18854'>It is, indeed, a fearful place. </span>
<span sid='18855' title='18855'>The torrent, swollen by the melting snow, plunges into a tremendous abyss, from which the spray rolls up like the smoke from a burning house. </span>
<span sid='18856' title='18856'>The shaft into which the river hurls itself is an immense chasm, lined by glistening, coal-black rock, and narrowing into a creaming, boiling pit of incalculable depth, which brims over and shoots the stream onward over its jagged lip. </span>
<span sid='18857' title='18857'>The long sweep of green water roaring for ever down, and the thick flickering curtain of spray hissing for ever upwards, turn a man giddy with their constant whirl and clamour. </span>
<span sid='18858' title='18858'>We stood near the edge peering down at the gleam of the breaking water far below us against the black rocks, and listening to the half-human shout which came booming up with the spray out of the abyss.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18859' title='18859'>The path has been cut half-way round the fall to afford a complete view, but it ends abruptly, and the traveller has to return as he came. </span>
<span sid='18860' title='18860'>We had turned to do so, when we saw a Swiss lad come running along it with a letter in his hand. </span>
<span sid='18861' title='18861'>It bore the mark of the hotel which we had just left, and was addressed to me by the landlord. </span>
<span sid='18862' title='18862'>It appeared that within a very few minutes of our leaving, an English lady had arrived who was in the last stage of consumption. </span>
<span sid='18863' title='18863'>She had wintered at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Davos Platz&t=h'>Davos Platz</a>, and was journeying now to join her friends at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lucerne&t=h'>Lucerne</a>, when a sudden haemorrhage had overtaken her. </span>
<span sid='18864' title='18864'>It was thought that she could hardly live a few hours, but it would be a great consolation to her to see an English doctor, and, if I would only return, etc., etc. </span>
<span sid='18865' title='18865'>The good Steiler assured me in a postscript that he would himself look upon my compliance as a very great favour, since the lady absolutely refused to see a Swiss physician, and he could not but feel that he was incurring a great responsibility.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18866' title='18866'>The appeal was one which could not be ignored. </span>
<span sid='18867' title='18867'>It was impossible to refuse the request of a fellow-countrywoman dying in a strange land. </span>
<span sid='18868' title='18868'>Yet I had my scruples about leaving Holmes. </span>
<span sid='18869' title='18869'>It was finally agreed, however, that he should retain the young Swiss messenger with him as guide and companion while I returned to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Meiringen&t=h'>Meiringen</a>. </span>
<span sid='18870' title='18870'>My friend would stay some little time at the fall, he said, and would then walk slowly over the hill to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Rosenlaui&t=h'>Rosenlaui</a>, where I was to rejoin him in the evening. </span>
<span sid='18871' title='18871'>As I turned away I saw Holmes with his back against a rock and his arms folded, gazing down at the rush of waters. </span>
<span sid='18872' title='18872'>It was the last that I was ever destined to see of him in this world.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18873' title='18873'>When I was near the bottom of the descent I looked back. </span>
<span sid='18874' title='18874'>It was impossible, from that position, to see the fall, but I could see the curving path which winds over the shoulder of the hill and leads to it. </span>
<span sid='18875' title='18875'>Along this a man was, I remember, walking very rapidly. </span>
<span sid='18876' title='18876'>I could see his black figure clearly outlined against the green behind him. </span>
<span sid='18877' title='18877'>I noted him, and the energy with which he walked, but he passed from my mind again as I hurried on upon my errand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18878' title='18878'>It may have been a little over an hour before I reached <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Meiringen&t=h'>Meiringen</a>. </span>
<span sid='18879' title='18879'>Old Steiler was standing at the porch of his hotel.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18880' title='18880'>'Well,' said I, as I came hurrying up, 'I trust that she is no worse?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18881' title='18881'>A look of surprise passed over his face, and at the first quiver of his eyebrows my heart turned to lead in my breast.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18882' title='18882'>'You did not write this?' </span>
<span sid='18883' title='18883'>I said, pulling the letter from my pocket. </span>
<span sid='18884' title='18884'>'There is no sick Englishwoman in the hotel?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18885' title='18885'>'Certainly not,' he cried. </span>
<span sid='18886' title='18886'>'But it has the hotel mark upon it! </span>
<span sid='18887' title='18887'>Ha! it must have been written by that tall Englishman who came in after you had gone. </span>
<span sid='18888' title='18888'>He said </span>
<span sid='18889' title='18889'>- 'But I waited for none of the landlord's explanations. </span>
<span sid='18890' title='18890'>In a tingle of fear I was already running down the village street, and making for the path which I had so lately descended. </span>
<span sid='18891' title='18891'>It had taken me an hour to come down. </span>
<span sid='18892' title='18892'>For all my efforts, two more had passed before I found myself at the fall of Reichenbach once more. </span>
<span sid='18893' title='18893'>There was Holmes's Alpine-stock still leaning against the rock by which I had left him. </span>
<span sid='18894' title='18894'>But there was no sign of him, and it was in vain that I shouted. </span>
<span sid='18895' title='18895'>My only answer was my own voice reverberating in a rolling echo from the cliffs around me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18896' title='18896'>It was the sight of that Alpine-stock which turned me cold and sick. </span>
<span sid='18897' title='18897'>He had not gone to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Rosenlaui&t=h'>Rosenlaui</a>, then. </span>
<span sid='18898' title='18898'>He had remained on that three-foot path, with sheer wall on one side and sheer drop upon the other, until his enemy had overtaken him. </span>
<span sid='18899' title='18899'>The young Swiss had gone too. </span>
<span sid='18900' title='18900'>He had probably been in the pay of Moriarty, and had left the two men together. </span>
<span sid='18901' title='18901'>And then what had happened? </span>
<span sid='18902' title='18902'>Who was to tell us what had happened then?</span>
<p>
<span sid='18903' title='18903'>I stood for a minute or two to collect myself, for I was dazed with the horror of the thing. </span>
<span sid='18904' title='18904'>Then I began to think of Holmes's own methods and to try to practise them in reading this tragedy. </span>
<span sid='18905' title='18905'>It was, alas! only too easy to do. </span>
<span sid='18906' title='18906'>During our conversation we had not gone to the end of the path, and the Alpine-stock marked the place where we had stood. </span>
<span sid='18907' title='18907'>The blackish soil is kept for ever soft by the incessant drift of spray, and a bird would leave its tread upon it. </span>
<span sid='18908' title='18908'>Two lines of footmarks were clearly marked along the farther end of the path, both leading away from me. </span>
<span sid='18909' title='18909'>There were none returning. </span>
<span sid='18910' title='18910'>A few yards from the end the soil was all ploughed up into a patch of mud, and the brambles and ferns which fringed the chasm were torn and bedraggled. </span>
<span sid='18911' title='18911'>I lay upon my face and peered over, with the spray spouting up all around me. </span>
<span sid='18912' title='18912'>It had darkened since I left, and now I could only see here and there the glistening of moisture upon the black walls, and far away down at the end of the shaft the gleam of the broken water. </span>
<span sid='18913' title='18913'>I shouted; but only that same halfhuman cry of the fall was borne back to my ears.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18914' title='18914'>But it was destined that I should after all have a last word of greeting from my friend and comrade. </span>
<span sid='18915' title='18915'>I have said that his Alpine-stock had been left leaning against a rock which jutted on to the path. </span>
<span sid='18916' title='18916'>From the top of this boulder the gleam of something bright caught my eye, and, raising my hand, I found that it came from the silver cigarette-case which he used to carry. </span>
<span sid='18917' title='18917'>As I took it up a small square of paper, upon which it had lain, fluttered down on to the ground. </span>
<span sid='18918' title='18918'>Unfolding it I found that it consisted of three pages torn from his note-book and addressed to me. </span>
<span sid='18919' title='18919'>It was characteristic of the man that the direction was as precise, and the writing as firm and clear, as though it had been written in his study.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18920' title='18920'>My DEAR WATSON, he said, I write these few lines through the courtesy of Mr Moriarty, who awaits my convenience for the final discussion of those questions which lie between us. </span>
<span sid='18921' title='18921'>He has been giving me a sketch of the methods by which he avoided the English police and kept himself informed of our movements. </span>
<span sid='18922' title='18922'>They certainly confirm the very high opinion which I had formed of his abilities. </span>
<span sid='18923' title='18923'>I am pleased to think that I shall be able to free society from any further effects of his presence, though I fear that it is at a cost which will give pain to my friends, and especially, my dear Watson, to you. </span>
<span sid='18924' title='18924'>I have already explained to you, however, that my career had in any case reached its crisis, and that no possible conclusion to it could be more congenial to me than this. </span>
<span sid='18925' title='18925'>Indeed, if I may make a full confession to you, I was quite convinced that the letter from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Meiringen&t=h'>Meiringen</a> was a hoax, and I allowed you to depart on that errand under the persuasion that some development of this sort would follow. </span>
<span sid='18926' title='18926'>Tell Inspector Paterson that the papers which he needs to convict the gang are in pigeon-hole M, done up in a blue envelope and inscribed "Moriarty". </span>
<span sid='18927' title='18927'>I made every disposition of my property before leaving <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, and handed it to my brother Mycroft. </span>
<span sid='18928' title='18928'>Pray give my greetings to Mrs Watson, and believe me to be, my dear fellow,</span>
<p>
<span sid='18929' title='18929'>Very sincerely yours, SHERLOCK HOLMES.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18930' title='18930'>A few words may suffice to tell the little that remains. </span>
<span sid='18931' title='18931'>An examination by experts leaves little doubt that a personal contest between the two men ended, as it could hardly fail to end in such a situation, in their reeling over, locked in each other's arms. </span>
<span sid='18932' title='18932'>Any attempt at recovering the bodies was absolutely hopeless, and there, deep down in that dreadful cauldron of swirling water and seething foam, will lie for all time the most dangerous criminal and the foremost champion of the law of their generation. </span>
<span sid='18933' title='18933'>The Swiss youth was never found again, and there can be no doubt that he was one of the numerous agents whom Moriarty kept in his employ. </span>
<span sid='18934' title='18934'>As to the gang, it will be within the memory of the public how completely the evidence which Holmes had accumulated exposed their organization, and how heavily the hand of the dead man weighed upon them. </span>
<span sid='18935' title='18935'>Of their terrible chief few details came out during the proceedings, and if I have now been compelled to make a clear statement of his career, it is due to those injudicious champions who have endeavoured to clear his memory by attacks upon him whom I shall ever regard as the best and the wisest man whom I have ever known.</span>
