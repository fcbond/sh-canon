<p>
<span sid='31029' title='31029'>In the third week of November, in the year 1895, a dense yellow fog settled down upon <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='31030' title='31030'>From the Monday to the Thursday I doubt whether it was ever possible from our windows in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> to see the loom of the opposite houses. </span>
<span sid='31031' title='31031'>The first day Holmes had spent in cross-indexing his huge book of references. </span>
<span sid='31032' title='31032'>The second and third had been patiently occupied upon a subject which he had recently made his hobby - the music of the Middle Ages. </span>
<span sid='31033' title='31033'>But when, for the fourth time, after pushing back our chairs from breakfast we saw the greasy, heavy brown swirl still drifting past us and condensing in oily drops upon the windowpanes, my comrade's impatient and active nature could endure this drab existence no longer. </span>
<span sid='31034' title='31034'>He paced restlessly about our sitting-room in a fever of suppressed energy, biting his nails, tapping the furniture, and chafing against inaction.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31035' title='31035'>'Nothing of interest in the paper, Watson?' he said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31036' title='31036'>I was aware that by anything of interest, Holmes meant anything of criminal interest. </span>
<span sid='31037' title='31037'>There was the news of a revolution, of a possible war, and of an impending change of Government, but these did not come within the horizon of my companion. </span>
<span sid='31038' title='31038'>I could see nothing recorded in the shape of crime which was not commonplace and futile. </span>
<span sid='31039' title='31039'>Holmes groaned and resumed his restless meanderings.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31040' title='31040'>'The <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> criminal is certainly a dull fellow,' said he, in the querulous voice of the sportsman whose game has failed him. </span>
<span sid='31041' title='31041'>'Look out of this window, Watson. </span>
<span sid='31042' title='31042'>See how the figures loom up, are dimly seen, and then blend once more into the cloud-bank. </span>
<span sid='31043' title='31043'>The thief or the murderer could roam <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> on such a day as the tiger does the jungle, unseen until he pounces, and then evident only to his victim.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31044' title='31044'>'There have,' said I, 'been numerous petty thefts.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31045' title='31045'>Holmes snorted his contempt.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31046' title='31046'>'This great and sombre stage is set for something more worthy than that,' said he. </span>
<span sid='31047' title='31047'>'It is fortunate for this community that I am not a criminal.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31048' title='31048'>'It is, indeed!' said I, heartily.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31049' title='31049'>'Suppose that I were Brooks or Woodhouse, or any of the fifty men who have good reason for taking my life, how long could I survive against my own pursuit? </span>
<span sid='31050' title='31050'>A summons, a bogus appointment, and all would be over. </span>
<span sid='31051' title='31051'>It is well they don't have days of fog in the Latin countries - the countries of assassination. </span>
<span sid='31052' title='31052'>By Jove! here comes something at last to break our dead monotony.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31053' title='31053'>It was the maid with a telegram. </span>
<span sid='31054' title='31054'>Holmes tore it open and burst out laughing.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31055' title='31055'>'Well, well! </span>
<span sid='31056' title='31056'>What next?' said he. </span>
<span sid='31057' title='31057'>'Brother Mycroft is coming round.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31058' title='31058'>'Why not?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31059' title='31059'>'Why not? </span>
<span sid='31060' title='31060'>It is as if you met a tram-car coming down a country lane. </span>
<span sid='31061' title='31061'>Mycroft has his rails and he runs on them. </span>
<span sid='31062' title='31062'>His <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pall Mall&t=h'>Pall Mall</a> lodgings, the Diogenes Club, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Whitehall&t=h'>Whitehall</a> - that is his cycle. </span>
<span sid='31063' title='31063'>Once, and only once, he has been here. </span>
<span sid='31064' title='31064'>What upheaval can possibly have derailed him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31065' title='31065'>'Does he not explain?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31066' title='31066'>Holmes handed me his brother's telegram.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31067' title='31067'>'Must see you over Cadogan West. </span>
<span sid='31068' title='31068'>Coming at once. </span>
<span sid='31069' title='31069'>Mycroft.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31070' title='31070'>'Cadogan West? </span>
<span sid='31071' title='31071'>I have heard the name.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31072' title='31072'>'It recalls nothing to my mind. </span>
<span sid='31073' title='31073'>But that Mycroft should break out in this erratic fashion! </span>
<span sid='31074' title='31074'>A planet might as well leave its orbit. </span>
<span sid='31075' title='31075'>By the way, do you know what Mycroft is?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31076' title='31076'>I had some vague recollection of an explanation at the time of the Adventure of the Greek Interpreter.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31077' title='31077'>'You told me that he had some small office under the British Government.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31078' title='31078'>Holmes chuckled.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31079' title='31079'>'I did not know you quite so well in those days. </span>
<span sid='31080' title='31080'>One has to be discreet when one talks of high matters of State. </span>
<span sid='31081' title='31081'>You are right in thinking that he is under the British Government. </span>
<span sid='31082' title='31082'>You would also be right in a sense if you said that occasionally he is the British Government.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31083' title='31083'>'My dear Holmes!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31084' title='31084'>'I thought I might surprise you. </span>
<span sid='31085' title='31085'>Mycroft draws four hundred and fifty pounds a year, remains a subordinate, has no ambitions of any kind, will receive neither honour nor title, but remains the most indispensable man in the country.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31086' title='31086'>'But how?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31087' title='31087'>'Well, his position is unique. </span>
<span sid='31088' title='31088'>He has made it for himself. </span>
<span sid='31089' title='31089'>There has never been anything like it before, nor will be again. </span>
<span sid='31090' title='31090'>He has the tidiest and most orderly brain, with the greatest capacity for storing facts, of any man living. </span>
<span sid='31091' title='31091'>The same great powers which I have turned to the detection of crime he has used for this particular business. </span>
<span sid='31092' title='31092'>The conclusions of every department are passed to him, and he is the central exchange, the clearing-house, which makes out the balance. </span>
<span sid='31093' title='31093'>All other men are specialists, but his specialism is omniscience. </span>
<span sid='31094' title='31094'>We will suppose that a Minister needs information as to a point which involves the Navy, India, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Canada&t=h'>Canada</a>, and the bi-metallic question, he could get his separate advices from various departments upon each, but only Mycroft can focus them all, and say off-hand how each factor would affect the other. </span>
<span sid='31095' title='31095'>They began by using him as a short-cut, a convenience, now he has made himself an essential. </span>
<span sid='31096' title='31096'>In that great brain of his everything is pigeon-holed, and can be handed out in an instant. </span>
<span sid='31097' title='31097'>Again and again his word has decided the national policy. </span>
<span sid='31098' title='31098'>He lives in it. </span>
<span sid='31099' title='31099'>He thinks of nothing else save when, as an intellectual exercise, he unbends if I call upon him and ask him to advise me on one of my little problems. </span>
<span sid='31100' title='31100'>But Jupiter is descending to-day. </span>
<span sid='31101' title='31101'>What on earth can it mean? </span>
<span sid='31102' title='31102'>Who is Cadogan West, and what is he to Mycroft?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31103' title='31103'>'I have it!' I cried, and plunged among the litter of papers upon the sofa. </span>
<span sid='31104' title='31104'>'Yes, yes, here he is, sure enough! </span>
<span sid='31105' title='31105'>Cadogan West was the young man who was found dead on the Underground on Tuesday morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31106' title='31106'>Holmes sat up at attention, his pipe half-way to his lips.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31107' title='31107'>'This must be serious, Watson. </span>
<span sid='31108' title='31108'>A death which has caused my brother to alter his habits can be no ordinary one. </span>
<span sid='31109' title='31109'>What in the world can he have to do with it? </span>
<span sid='31110' title='31110'>The case was featureless as I remember it. </span>
<span sid='31111' title='31111'>The young man had apparently fallen out of the train and killed himself. </span>
<span sid='31112' title='31112'>He had not been robbed, and there was no particular reason to suspect violence. </span>
<span sid='31113' title='31113'>Is that not so?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31114' title='31114'>'There has been an inquest,' said I, 'and a good many fresh facts have come out. </span>
<span sid='31115' title='31115'>Looked at more closely, I should certainly say that it was a curious case.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31116' title='31116'>'Judging by its effect upon my brother, I should think it must be a most extraordinary one.' </span>
<span sid='31117' title='31117'>He snuggled down in his arm-chair. </span>
<span sid='31118' title='31118'>'Now, Watson, let us have the facts.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31119' title='31119'>'The man's name was Arthur Cadogan West. </span>
<span sid='31120' title='31120'>He was twenty-seven years of age, unmarried, and a clerk at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Woolwich&t=h'>Woolwich</a> Arsenal.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31121' title='31121'>'Government employ. </span>
<span sid='31122' title='31122'>Behold the link with brother Mycroft!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31123' title='31123'>'He left <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Woolwich&t=h'>Woolwich</a> suddenly on Monday night. </span>
<span sid='31124' title='31124'>Was last seen by his fiancée, Miss Violet Westbury, whom he left abruptly in the fog about 7.30 that evening. </span>
<span sid='31125' title='31125'>There was no quarrel between them and she can give no motive for his action. </span>
<span sid='31126' title='31126'>The next thing heard of him was when his dead body was discovered by a plate-layer named Mason, just outside <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Aldgate Station&t=h'>Aldgate Station</a> on the Underground system in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31127' title='31127'>'When?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31128' title='31128'>'The body was found at six on the Tuesday morning. </span>
<span sid='31129' title='31129'>It was lying wide of the metals upon the left hand of the track as one goes eastward, at a point close to the station, where the line emerges from the tunnel in which it runs. </span>
<span sid='31130' title='31130'>The head was badly crushed - an injury which might well have been caused by a fall from the train. </span>
<span sid='31131' title='31131'>The body could only have come on the fine in that way. </span>
<span sid='31132' title='31132'>Had it been carried down from any neighbouring street, it must have passed the station barriers, where a collector is always standing. </span>
<span sid='31133' title='31133'>This point seems absolutely certain.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31134' title='31134'>'Very good. </span>
<span sid='31135' title='31135'>The case was definite enough. </span>
<span sid='31136' title='31136'>The man, dead or alive, either fell or was precipitated from a train. </span>
<span sid='31137' title='31137'>So much is clear to me. </span>
<span sid='31138' title='31138'>Continue.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31139' title='31139'>'The trains which traverse the lines of rail beside which the body was found are those which run from west to east, some being purely Metropolitan, and some from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Willesden&t=h'>Willesden</a> and out-lying junctions. </span>
<span sid='31140' title='31140'>It can be stated for certain that this young man, when he met his death, was travelling in this direction at some late hour of the night, but at what point he entered the train it is impossible to state.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31141' title='31141'>'His ticket, of course, would show that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31142' title='31142'>'There was no ticket in his pockets.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31143' title='31143'>'No ticket! </span>
<span sid='31144' title='31144'>Dear me, Watson, this is really very singular. </span>
<span sid='31145' title='31145'>According to my experience it is not possible to reach the platform of a Metropolitan train without exhibiting one's ticket. </span>
<span sid='31146' title='31146'>Presumably, then, the young man had one. </span>
<span sid='31147' title='31147'>Was it taken from him in order to conceal the station from which he came? </span>
<span sid='31148' title='31148'>It is possible. </span>
<span sid='31149' title='31149'>Or did he drop it in the carriage? </span>
<span sid='31150' title='31150'>That also is possible. </span>
<span sid='31151' title='31151'>But the point is of curious interest. </span>
<span sid='31152' title='31152'>I understand that there was no sign of robbery?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31153' title='31153'>'Apparently not. </span>
<span sid='31154' title='31154'>There is a list here of his possessions. </span>
<span sid='31155' title='31155'>His purse contained two pounds fifteen. </span>
<span sid='31156' title='31156'>He had also a cheque-book on the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Woolwich&t=h'>Woolwich</a> branch of the Capital and Counties Bank. </span>
<span sid='31157' title='31157'>Through this his identity was established. </span>
<span sid='31158' title='31158'>There were also two dress-circle tickets for the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Woolwich&t=h'>Woolwich</a> Theatre, dated for that very evening. </span>
<span sid='31159' title='31159'>Also a small packet of technical papers.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31160' title='31160'>Holmes gave an exclamation of satisfaction.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31161' title='31161'>'There we have it at last, Watson! </span>
<span sid='31162' title='31162'>British Government-<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Woolwich&t=h'>Woolwich</a> Arsenal - Technical papers - Brother Mycroft, the chain is complete. </span>
<span sid='31163' title='31163'>But here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to speak for himself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31164' title='31164'>A moment later the tall and portly form of Mycroft Holmes was ushered into the room. </span>
<span sid='31165' title='31165'>Heavily built and massive, there was a suggestion of uncouth physical inertia in the figure, but above this unwieldy frame there was perched a head so masterful in its brow, so alert in its steel-grey, deep-set eyes, so firm in its lips, and so subtle in its play of expression, that after the first glance one forgot the gross body and remembered only the dominant mind.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31166' title='31166'>At his heels came our old friend Lestrade, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a> - thin and austere. </span>
<span sid='31167' title='31167'>The gravity of both their faces foretold some weighty quest. </span>
<span sid='31168' title='31168'>The detective shook hands without a word. </span>
<span sid='31169' title='31169'>Mycroft Holmes struggled out of his overcoat and subsided into an arm-chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31170' title='31170'>'A most annoying business, Sherlock,' said he. </span>
<span sid='31171' title='31171'>'I extremely dislike altering my habits, but the powers that be would take no denial. </span>
<span sid='31172' title='31172'>In the present state of Siam it is most awkward that I should be away from the office. </span>
<span sid='31173' title='31173'>But it is a real crisis. </span>
<span sid='31174' title='31174'>I have never seen the Prime Minister so upset. </span>
<span sid='31175' title='31175'>As to the Admiralty-it is buzzing like an overturned bee-hive. </span>
<span sid='31176' title='31176'>Have you read up the case?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31177' title='31177'>'We have just done so. </span>
<span sid='31178' title='31178'>What were the technical papers?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31179' title='31179'>'Ah, there's the point! </span>
<span sid='31180' title='31180'>Fortunately, it has not come out. </span>
<span sid='31181' title='31181'>The Press would be furious if it did. </span>
<span sid='31182' title='31182'>The papers which this wretched youth had in his pocket were the plans of the Bruce-Partington submarine.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31183' title='31183'>Mycroft Holmes spoke with a solemnity which showed his sense of the importance of the subject. </span>
<span sid='31184' title='31184'>His brother and I sat expectant.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31185' title='31185'>'Surely you have heard of it? </span>
<span sid='31186' title='31186'>I thought everyone had heard of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31187' title='31187'>'Only as a name.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31188' title='31188'>'Its importance can hardly be exaggerated. </span>
<span sid='31189' title='31189'>It has been the most jealously guarded of all Government secrets. </span>
<span sid='31190' title='31190'>You may take it from me that naval warfare becomes impossible within the radius of a Bruce-Partington's operation. </span>
<span sid='31191' title='31191'>Two years ago a very large sum was smuggled through the Estimates and was expended in acquiring a monopoly of the invention. </span>
<span sid='31192' title='31192'>Every effort has been made to keep the secret. </span>
<span sid='31193' title='31193'>The plans, which are exceedingly intricate, comprising some thirty separate patents, each essential to the working of the whole, are kept in an elaborate safe in a confidential office adjoining the Arsenal, with burglar-proof doors and windows. </span>
<span sid='31194' title='31194'>Under no conceivable circumstances were the plans to be taken from the office. </span>
<span sid='31195' title='31195'>If the Chief Constructor of the Navy desired to consult them, even he was forced to go to the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Woolwich&t=h'>Woolwich</a> office for the purpose. </span>
<span sid='31196' title='31196'>And yet here we find them in the pockets of a dead junior clerk in the heart of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='31197' title='31197'>From an official point of view it's simply awful.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31198' title='31198'>'But you have recovered them?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31199' title='31199'>'No, Sherlock, no! </span>
<span sid='31200' title='31200'>That's the pinch. </span>
<span sid='31201' title='31201'>We have not. </span>
<span sid='31202' title='31202'>Ten papers were taken from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Woolwich&t=h'>Woolwich</a>. </span>
<span sid='31203' title='31203'>There were seven in the pockets of Cadogan West. </span>
<span sid='31204' title='31204'>The three most essential are gone - stolen, vanished. </span>
<span sid='31205' title='31205'>You must drop everything, Sherlock. </span>
<span sid='31206' title='31206'>Never mind your usual petty puzzles of the police-court. </span>
<span sid='31207' title='31207'>It's a vital international problem that you have to solve. </span>
<span sid='31208' title='31208'>Why did Cadogan West take the papers, where are the missing ones, how did he die, how came his body where it was found, how can the evil be set right? </span>
<span sid='31209' title='31209'>Find an answer to all these questions, and you will have done good service for your country.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31210' title='31210'>'Why do you not solve it yourself, Mycroft? </span>
<span sid='31211' title='31211'>You can see as far as I.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31212' title='31212'>'Possibly, Sherlock. </span>
<span sid='31213' title='31213'>But it is a question of getting details. </span>
<span sid='31214' title='31214'>Give me your details, and from an arm-chair I will return you an excellent expert opinion. </span>
<span sid='31215' title='31215'>But to run here and run there, to cross-question railway guards, and lie on my face with a lens to my eye - it is not my métier. </span>
<span sid='31216' title='31216'>No, you are the one man who can clear the matter up. </span>
<span sid='31217' title='31217'>If you have a fancy to see your name in the next honours list-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31218' title='31218'>My friend smiled and shook his head.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31219' title='31219'>'I play the game for the game's own sake,' said he. </span>
<span sid='31220' title='31220'>'But the problem certainly presents some points of interest, and I shall be very pleased to look into it. </span>
<span sid='31221' title='31221'>Some more facts, please.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31222' title='31222'>'I have jotted down the more essential ones upon this sheet of paper, together with a few addresses which you will find of service. </span>
<span sid='31223' title='31223'>The actual official guardian of the papers is the famous Government expert, Sir James Walter, whose decorations and sub-titles fill two lines of a book of reference. </span>
<span sid='31224' title='31224'>He has grown grey in the service, is a gentleman, a favoured guest in the most exalted houses, and above all a man whose patriotism is beyond suspicion. </span>
<span sid='31225' title='31225'>He is one of two who have a key of the safe. </span>
<span sid='31226' title='31226'>I may add that the papers were undoubtedly in the office during working hours on Monday, and that Sir James left for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> about three o'clock taking his key with him. </span>
<span sid='31227' title='31227'>He was at the house of Admiral Sinclair at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Barclay Square&t=h'>Barclay Square</a> during the whole of the evening when this incident occurred.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31228' title='31228'>'Has the fact been verified?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31229' title='31229'>'Yes, his brother, Colonel Valentine Walter, has testified to his departure from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Woolwich&t=h'>Woolwich</a>, and Admiral Sinclair to his arrival in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, so Sir James is no longer a direct factor in the problem.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31230' title='31230'>'Who was the other man with a key?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31231' title='31231'>'The senior clerk and draughtsman, Mr Sidney Johnson. </span>
<span sid='31232' title='31232'>He is a man of forty, married, with five children. </span>
<span sid='31233' title='31233'>He is a silent, morose man, but he has, on the whole, an excellent record in the public service. </span>
<span sid='31234' title='31234'>He is unpopular with his colleagues, but a hard worker. </span>
<span sid='31235' title='31235'>According to his own account, corroborated only by the word of his wife, he was at home the whole of Monday evening after office hours, and his key has never left the watch-chain upon which it hangs.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31236' title='31236'>'Tell us about Cadogan West.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31237' title='31237'>'He has been ten years in the Service, and has done good work. </span>
<span sid='31238' title='31238'>He has the reputation of being hot-headed and impetuous, but a straight, honest man. </span>
<span sid='31239' title='31239'>We have nothing against him. </span>
<span sid='31240' title='31240'>He was next Sidney Johnson in the office. </span>
<span sid='31241' title='31241'>His duties brought him into daily, personal contact with the plans. </span>
<span sid='31242' title='31242'>No one else had the handling of them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31243' title='31243'>'Who locked the plans up that night?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31244' title='31244'>'Mr Sidney Johnson, the senior clerk.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31245' title='31245'>'Well, it is surely perfectly clear who took them away. </span>
<span sid='31246' title='31246'>They are actually found upon the person of this junior clerk, Cadogan West. </span>
<span sid='31247' title='31247'>That seems final, does it not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31248' title='31248'>'It does, Sherlock, and yet it leaves so much unexplained. </span>
<span sid='31249' title='31249'>In the first place, why did he take them?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31250' title='31250'>'I presume they were of value?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31251' title='31251'>'He could have got several thousands for them very easily.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31252' title='31252'>'Can you suggest any possible motive for taking the papers to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> except to sell them?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31253' title='31253'>'No, I cannot.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31254' title='31254'>'Then we must take that as our working hypothesis. </span>
<span sid='31255' title='31255'>Young West took the papers. </span>
<span sid='31256' title='31256'>Now this could only be done by having a false key-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31257' title='31257'>'Several false keys. </span>
<span sid='31258' title='31258'>He had to open the building and the room.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31259' title='31259'>'He had, then, several false keys. </span>
<span sid='31260' title='31260'>He took the papers to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> to sell the secret, intending, no doubt, to have the plans themselves back in the safe next morning before they were missed. </span>
<span sid='31261' title='31261'>While in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> on this treasonable mission he met his end.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31262' title='31262'>'How?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31263' title='31263'>'We will suppose that he was travelling back to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Woolwich&t=h'>Woolwich</a> when he was killed and thrown out of the compartment.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31264' title='31264'>'Aldgate, where the body was found, is considerably past the station for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> Bridge, which would be his route to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Woolwich&t=h'>Woolwich</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31265' title='31265'>'Many circumstances could be imagined under which he would pass <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> Bridge. </span>
<span sid='31266' title='31266'>There was someone in the carriage, for example, with whom he was having an absorbing interview. </span>
<span sid='31267' title='31267'>This interview led to a violent scene, in which he lost his life. </span>
<span sid='31268' title='31268'>Possibly he tried to leave the carriage, fell out on the line, and so met his end. </span>
<span sid='31269' title='31269'>The other closed the door. </span>
<span sid='31270' title='31270'>There was a thick fog, and nothing could be seen.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31271' title='31271'>'No better explanation can be given with our present knowledge, and yet consider, Sherlock, how much you leave untouched. </span>
<span sid='31272' title='31272'>We will suppose, for argument's sake, that young Cadogan West had determined to convey these papers to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='31273' title='31273'>He would naturally have made an appointment with the foreign agent and kept his evening clear. </span>
<span sid='31274' title='31274'>Instead of that, he took two tickets for the theatre, escorted his fiancée half-way there, and then suddenly disappeared.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31275' title='31275'>'A blind,' said Lestrade, who had sat listening with some impatience to the conversation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31276' title='31276'>'A very singular one. </span>
<span sid='31277' title='31277'>That is objection No. 1. </span>
<span sid='31278' title='31278'>Objection No. 2: We will suppose that he reaches <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> and sees the foreign agent. </span>
<span sid='31279' title='31279'>He must bring back the papers before morning or the loss will be discovered. </span>
<span sid='31280' title='31280'>He took away ten. </span>
<span sid='31281' title='31281'>Only seven were in his pocket. </span>
<span sid='31282' title='31282'>What had become of the other three? </span>
<span sid='31283' title='31283'>He certainly would not leave them of his own free will. </span>
<span sid='31284' title='31284'>Then, again, where is the price of his treason? </span>
<span sid='31285' title='31285'>One would have expected to find a large sum of money in his pocket.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31286' title='31286'>'It seems to me perfectly clear,' said Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='31287' title='31287'>'I have no doubt at all as to what occurred. </span>
<span sid='31288' title='31288'>He took the papers to sell them. </span>
<span sid='31289' title='31289'>He saw the agent. </span>
<span sid='31290' title='31290'>They could not agree as to price. </span>
<span sid='31291' title='31291'>He started home again, but the agent went with him. </span>
<span sid='31292' title='31292'>In the train the agent murdered him, took the more essential papers, and threw his body from the carriage. </span>
<span sid='31293' title='31293'>That would account for everything, would it not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31294' title='31294'>'Why had he no ticket?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31295' title='31295'>'The ticket would have shown which station was nearest the agent's house. </span>
<span sid='31296' title='31296'>Therefore he took it from the murdered man's pocket.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31297' title='31297'>'Good, Lestrade, very good,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='31298' title='31298'>'Your theory holds together. </span>
<span sid='31299' title='31299'>But if this is true, then the case is at an end. </span>
<span sid='31300' title='31300'>On the one hand the traitor is dead. </span>
<span sid='31301' title='31301'>On the other the plans of the Bruce-Partington submarine are presumably already on <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Continent&t=h'>the Continent</a>. </span>
<span sid='31302' title='31302'>What is there for us to do?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31303' title='31303'>'To act, Sherlock-to act!' cried Mycroft, springing to his feet. </span>
<span sid='31304' title='31304'>'All my instincts are against this explanation. </span>
<span sid='31305' title='31305'>Use your powers! </span>
<span sid='31306' title='31306'>Go to the scene of the crime! </span>
<span sid='31307' title='31307'>See the people concerned! </span>
<span sid='31308' title='31308'>Leave no stone unturned! </span>
<span sid='31309' title='31309'>In all your career you have never had so great a chance of serving your country.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31310' title='31310'>'Well, well!' said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders. </span>
<span sid='31311' title='31311'>'Come, Watson! </span>
<span sid='31312' title='31312'>And you, Lestrade, could you favour us with your company for an hour or two? </span>
<span sid='31313' title='31313'>We will begin our investigation by a visit to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Aldgate Station&t=h'>Aldgate Station</a>. </span>
<span sid='31314' title='31314'>Good-bye, Mycroft. </span>
<span sid='31315' title='31315'>I shall let you have a report before evening, but I warn you in advance that you have little to expect.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31316' title='31316'>An hour later, Holmes, Lestrade, and I, stood upon the Underground railroad at the point where it emerges from the tunnel immediately before <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Aldgate Station&t=h'>Aldgate Station</a>. </span>
<span sid='31317' title='31317'>A courteous, red-faced old gentleman represented the railway company.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31318' title='31318'>'This is where the young man's body lay,' said he, indicating a spot about three feet from the metals. </span>
<span sid='31319' title='31319'>'It could not have fallen from above, for these, as you see, are all blank walls. </span>
<span sid='31320' title='31320'>Therefore, it could only have come from a train, and that train, so far as we can trace it, must have passed about midnight on Monday.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31321' title='31321'>'Have the carriages been examined for any sign of violence?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31322' title='31322'>'There are no such signs, and no ticket has been found.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31323' title='31323'>'No record of a door being found open?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31324' title='31324'>'None.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31325' title='31325'>'We have had some fresh evidence this morning,' said Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='31326' title='31326'>'A passenger who passed Aldgate in an ordinary Metropolitan train about 11.40 on Monday night declares that he heard a heavy thud, as of a body striking the line, just before the train reached the station. </span>
<span sid='31327' title='31327'>There was dense fog, however, and nothing could be seen. </span>
<span sid='31328' title='31328'>He made no report of it at the time. </span>
<span sid='31329' title='31329'>Why, whatever is the matter with Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31330' title='31330'>My friend was standing with an expression of strained intensity upon his face, staring at the railway metals where they curved out of the tunnel. </span>
<span sid='31331' title='31331'>Aldgate is a junction, and there was a network of points. </span>
<span sid='31332' title='31332'>On these his eager, questioning eyes were fixed, and I saw on his keen, alert face that tightening of the lips, that quiver of the nostrils, and concentration of the heavy tufted brows which I knew so well.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31333' title='31333'>'Points,' he muttered, 'the points.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31334' title='31334'>'What of it? </span>
<span sid='31335' title='31335'>What do you mean?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31336' title='31336'>'I suppose there are no great number of points on a system such as this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31337' title='31337'>'No, there are very few.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31338' title='31338'>'And a curve, too. </span>
<span sid='31339' title='31339'>Points, and a curve. </span>
<span sid='31340' title='31340'>By Jove! if it were only so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31341' title='31341'>'What is it, Mr Holmes? </span>
<span sid='31342' title='31342'>Have you a clue?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31343' title='31343'>'An idea-an indication, no more. </span>
<span sid='31344' title='31344'>But the case certainly grows in interest. </span>
<span sid='31345' title='31345'>Unique, perfectly unique, and yet why not? </span>
<span sid='31346' title='31346'>I do not see any indications of bleeding on the line.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31347' title='31347'>'There were hardly any.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31348' title='31348'>'But I understand that there was a considerable wound.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31349' title='31349'>'The bone was crushed, but there was no great external injury.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31350' title='31350'>'And yet one would have expected some bleeding. </span>
<span sid='31351' title='31351'>Would it be possible for me to inspect the train which contained the passenger who heard the thud of a fall in the fog?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31352' title='31352'>'I fear not, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='31353' title='31353'>The train has been broken up before now, and the carriages redistributed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31354' title='31354'>'I can assure you, Mr Holmes,' said Lestrade, 'that every carriage has been carefully examined. </span>
<span sid='31355' title='31355'>I saw to it myself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31356' title='31356'>It was one of my friend's most obvious weaknesses that he was impatient with less alert intelligences than his own.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31357' title='31357'>'Very likely,' said he, turning away. </span>
<span sid='31358' title='31358'>'As it happens, it was not the carriages which I desired to examine. </span>
<span sid='31359' title='31359'>Watson, we have done all we can here. </span>
<span sid='31360' title='31360'>We need not trouble you any further, Mr Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='31361' title='31361'>I think our investigations must now carry us to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Woolwich&t=h'>Woolwich</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31362' title='31362'>At <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> Bridge Holmes wrote a telegram to his brother, which he handed to me before dispatching it. </span>
<span sid='31363' title='31363'>It ran thus:</span>
<p>
<span sid='31364' title='31364'>See some light in the darkness, but it may possibly flicker out. </span>
<span sid='31365' title='31365'>Meanwhile, please send by messenger, to await return at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>, a complete list of all foreign spies or international agents known to be in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, with full address.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31366' title='31366'>SHERLOCK</span>
<p>
<span sid='31367' title='31367'>'That should be helpful, Watson,' he remarked, as we took our seats in the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Woolwich&t=h'>Woolwich</a> train. </span>
<span sid='31368' title='31368'>'We certainly owe brother Mycroft a debt for having introduced us to what promises to be a really very remarkable case.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31369' title='31369'>His eager face still wore that expression of intense and high-strung energy, which showed me that some novel and suggestive circumstance had opened up a stimulating line of thought. </span>
<span sid='31370' title='31370'>See the foxhound with hanging ears and drooping tail as it lolls about the kennels, and compare it with the same hound as, with gleaming eyes and straining muscles, it runs upon a breast-high scent-such was the change in Holmes since the morning. </span>
<span sid='31371' title='31371'>He was a different man to the limp and lounging figure in the mouse-coloured dressing-gown who had prowled so restlessly only a few hours before round the fog-girt room.</span>
<span sid='31372' title='31372'>'There is material here. </span>
<span sid='31373' title='31373'>There is scope,' said he. </span>
<span sid='31374' title='31374'>'I am dull indeed not to have understood its possibilities.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31375' title='31375'>'Even now they are dark to me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31376' title='31376'>'The end is dark to me also, but I have hold of one idea which may lead us far. </span>
<span sid='31377' title='31377'>The man met his death elsewhere, and his body was on the roof of a carriage.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31378' title='31378'>'On the roof!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31379' title='31379'>'Remarkable, is it not? </span>
<span sid='31380' title='31380'>But consider the facts. </span>
<span sid='31381' title='31381'>Is it a coincidence that it is found at the very point where the train pitches and sways as it comes round on the points? </span>
<span sid='31382' title='31382'>Is not that the Place where an object upon the roof might be expected to fall off? </span>
<span sid='31383' title='31383'>The points would affect no object inside the train. </span>
<span sid='31384' title='31384'>Either the body fell from the roof, or a very curious coincidence has occurred. </span>
<span sid='31385' title='31385'>But now consider the question of the blood. </span>
<span sid='31386' title='31386'>Of course, there was no bleeding on the line if the body had bled elsewhere. </span>
<span sid='31387' title='31387'>Each fact is suggestive in itself. </span>
<span sid='31388' title='31388'>Together they have a cumulative force.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31389' title='31389'>'And the ticket, too!' I cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31390' title='31390'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='31391' title='31391'>We could not explain the absence of a ticket. </span>
<span sid='31392' title='31392'>This would explain it. </span>
<span sid='31393' title='31393'>Everything fits together.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31394' title='31394'>'But suppose it were so, we are still as far as ever from unravelling the mystery of his death. </span>
<span sid='31395' title='31395'>Indeed, it becomes not simpler, but stranger.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31396' title='31396'>'Perhaps,' said Holmes, thoughtfully, 'perhaps.' </span>
<span sid='31397' title='31397'>He relapsed into a silent reverie, which lasted until the slow train drew up at last in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Woolwich&t=h'>Woolwich</a> Station. </span>
<span sid='31398' title='31398'>There he called a cab and drew Mycroft's paper from his pocket.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31399' title='31399'>'We have quite a little round of afternoon calls to make,' said he. </span>
<span sid='31400' title='31400'>'I think that Sir James Walter claims our first attention.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31401' title='31401'>The house of the famous official was a fine villa with green lawns stretching down to the Thames. </span>
<span sid='31402' title='31402'>As we reached it the fog was lifting, and a thin, watery sunshine was breaking through. </span>
<span sid='31403' title='31403'>A butler answered our ring.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31404' title='31404'>'Sir James, sir!' said he, with solemn face. </span>
<span sid='31405' title='31405'>'Sir James died this morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31406' title='31406'>'Good heavens!' cried Holmes, in amazement. </span>
<span sid='31407' title='31407'>'How did he die?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31408' title='31408'>'Perhaps you would care to step in, sir, and see his brother, Colonel Valentine?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31409' title='31409'>'Yes, we had best do so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31410' title='31410'>We were ushered into a dim-fit drawing-room, where an instant later we were joined by a very tall, handsome, light-bearded man of fifty, the younger brother of the dead scientist. </span>
<span sid='31411' title='31411'>His wild eyes, stained cheeks, and unkempt hair all spoke of the sudden blow which had fallen upon the household. </span>
<span sid='31412' title='31412'>He was hardly articulate as he spoke of it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31413' title='31413'>'It was this horrible scandal,' said he. </span>
<span sid='31414' title='31414'>'My brother, Sir James, was a man of very sensitive honour, and he could not survive such an affair. </span>
<span sid='31415' title='31415'>It broke his heart. </span>
<span sid='31416' title='31416'>He was always so proud of the efficiency of his department, and this was a crushing blow.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31417' title='31417'>'We had hoped that he might have given us some indications which would have helped us to clear the matter up.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31418' title='31418'>'I assure you that it was all a mystery to him as it is to you and to all of us. </span>
<span sid='31419' title='31419'>He had already put all his knowledge at the disposal of the police. </span>
<span sid='31420' title='31420'>Naturally, he had no doubt that Cadogan West was guilty. </span>
<span sid='31421' title='31421'>But all the rest was inconceivable.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31422' title='31422'>'You cannot throw any new light upon the affair?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31423' title='31423'>'I know nothing myself save what I have read or heard. </span>
<span sid='31424' title='31424'>I have no desire to be discourteous, but you can understand, Mr Holmes, that we are much disturbed at present, and I must ask you to hasten this interview to an end.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31425' title='31425'>'This is indeed an unexpected development,' said my friend when we had regained the cab. </span>
<span sid='31426' title='31426'>'I wonder if the death was natural, or whether the poor old fellow killed himself! </span>
<span sid='31427' title='31427'>If the latter, may it be taken as some sign of self-reproach for duty neglected? </span>
<span sid='31428' title='31428'>We must leave that question to the future. </span>
<span sid='31429' title='31429'>Now we shall turn to the Cadogan Wests.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31430' title='31430'>A small but well-kept house in the outskirts of the town sheltered the bereaved mother. </span>
<span sid='31431' title='31431'>The old lady was too dazed with grief to be of any use to us, but at her side was a white-faced young lady, who introduced herself as Miss Violet Westbury, the fiancée of the dead man, and the last to see him upon that fatal night.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31432' title='31432'>'I cannot explain it, Mr Holmes,' she said. </span>
<span sid='31433' title='31433'>'I have not shut an eye since the tragedy, thinking, thinking, thinking, night and day, what the true meaning of it can be. </span>
<span sid='31434' title='31434'>Arthur was the most single-minded, chivalrous, patriotic man upon earth. </span>
<span sid='31435' title='31435'>He would have cut his right hand off before he would sell a State secret confided to his keeping. </span>
<span sid='31436' title='31436'>It is absurd, impossible, preposterous to anyone who knew him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31437' title='31437'>'But the facts, Miss Westbury?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31438' title='31438'>'Yes, yes, I admit I cannot explain them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31439' title='31439'>'Was he in any want of money?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31440' title='31440'>'No, his needs were very simple and his salary ample. </span>
<span sid='31441' title='31441'>He had saved a few hundreds, and we were to marry at the New Year.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31442' title='31442'>'No signs of any mental excitement? </span>
<span sid='31443' title='31443'>Come, Miss Westbury, be absolutely frank with us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31444' title='31444'>The quick eye of my companion had noted some change in her manner. </span>
<span sid='31445' title='31445'>She coloured and hesitated.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31446' title='31446'>'Yes,' she said, at last. </span>
<span sid='31447' title='31447'>'I had a feeling that there was something on his mind.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31448' title='31448'>'For long?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31449' title='31449'>'Only for the last week or so. </span>
<span sid='31450' title='31450'>He was thoughtful and worried. </span>
<span sid='31451' title='31451'>Once I pressed him about it. </span>
<span sid='31452' title='31452'>He admitted that there was something, and that it was concerned with his official life. </span>
<span sid='31453' title='31453'>"It is too serious for me to speak about, even to you," said he. </span>
<span sid='31454' title='31454'>I could get nothing more.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31455' title='31455'>Holmes looked grave.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31456' title='31456'>'Go on, Miss Westbury. </span>
<span sid='31457' title='31457'>Even if it seems to tell against him, go on. </span>
<span sid='31458' title='31458'>We cannot say what it may lead to.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31459' title='31459'>'Indeed, I have nothing more to tell. </span>
<span sid='31460' title='31460'>Once or twice it seemed to me that he was on the point of telling me something. </span>
<span sid='31461' title='31461'>He spoke one evening of the importance of the secret, and I have some recollection that he said that no doubt foreign spies would pay a great deal to have it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31462' title='31462'>My friend's face grew graver still.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31463' title='31463'>'Anything else?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31464' title='31464'>'He said that we were slack about such matters - that it would be easy for a traitor to get the plans.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31465' title='31465'>'Was it only recently that he made such remarks?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31466' title='31466'>'Yes, quite recently.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31467' title='31467'>'Now tell us of that last evening.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31468' title='31468'>'We were to go to the theatre. </span>
<span sid='31469' title='31469'>The fog was so thick that a cab was useless. </span>
<span sid='31470' title='31470'>We walked, and our way took us close to the office. </span>
<span sid='31471' title='31471'>Suddenly he darted away into the fog.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31472' title='31472'>'Without a word?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31473' title='31473'>'He gave an exclamation, that was all. </span>
<span sid='31474' title='31474'>I waited, but he never returned. </span>
<span sid='31475' title='31475'>Then I walked home. </span>
<span sid='31476' title='31476'>Next morning, after the office opened, they came to inquire. </span>
<span sid='31477' title='31477'>About twelve o'clock we heard the terrible news. </span>
<span sid='31478' title='31478'>Oh, Mr Holmes, if you could only, only save his honour!. </span>
<span sid='31479' title='31479'>It was so much to him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31480' title='31480'>Holmes shook his head sadly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31481' title='31481'>'Come, Watson,' said he, 'our ways lie elsewhere. </span>
<span sid='31482' title='31482'>Our next station must be the office from which the papers were taken.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31483' title='31483'>'It was black enough before against this young man, but our inquiries make it blacker,' he remarked, as the cab lumbered off. </span>
<span sid='31484' title='31484'>'His coming marriage gives a motive for the crime. </span>
<span sid='31485' title='31485'>He naturally wanted money. </span>
<span sid='31486' title='31486'>The idea was in his head, since he spoke about it. </span>
<span sid='31487' title='31487'>He nearly made the girl an accomplice in the treason by telling her his plans. </span>
<span sid='31488' title='31488'>It is all very bad.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31489' title='31489'>'But surely, Holmes, character goes for something? </span>
<span sid='31490' title='31490'>Then, again, why should he leave the girl in the street and dart away to commit a felony?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31491' title='31491'>'Exactly! </span>
<span sid='31492' title='31492'>There are certainly objections. </span>
<span sid='31493' title='31493'>But it is a formidable case which they have to meet.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31494' title='31494'>Mr Sidney Johnson, the senior clerk, met us at the office, and received us with that respect which my companion's card always commanded. </span>
<span sid='31495' title='31495'>He was a thin, gruff, bespectacled man of middle age, his cheeks haggard, and his hands twitching from the nervous strain to which he had been subjected.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31496' title='31496'>'It is bad, Mr Holmes, very bad! </span>
<span sid='31497' title='31497'>Have you heard of the death of the chief?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31498' title='31498'>'We have just come from his house.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31499' title='31499'>'The place is disorganized. </span>
<span sid='31500' title='31500'>The chief dead, Cadogan West dead, our papers stolen. </span>
<span sid='31501' title='31501'>And yet, when we closed our door on Monday evening we were as efficient an office as any in the Government service. </span>
<span sid='31502' title='31502'>Good God, it's dreadful to think of! </span>
<span sid='31503' title='31503'>That West, of all men, should have done such a thing!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31504' title='31504'>'You are sure of his guilt, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31505' title='31505'>'I can see no other way out of it. </span>
<span sid='31506' title='31506'>And yet I would have trusted him as I trust myself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31507' title='31507'>'At what hour was the office closed on Monday?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31508' title='31508'>'At five.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31509' title='31509'>'Did you close it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31510' title='31510'>'I am always the last man out.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31511' title='31511'>'Where were the plans?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31512' title='31512'>'In that safe. </span>
<span sid='31513' title='31513'>I put them there myself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31514' title='31514'>'Is there no watchman to the building?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31515' title='31515'>'There is, but he has other departments to look after as well. </span>
<span sid='31516' title='31516'>He is an old soldier and a most trustworthy man. </span>
<span sid='31517' title='31517'>He saw nothing that evening. </span>
<span sid='31518' title='31518'>Of course, the fog was very thick.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31519' title='31519'>'Suppose that Cadogan West wished to make his way into the building after hours, he would need three keys, would he not, before he could reach the papers?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31520' title='31520'>'Yes, he would. </span>
<span sid='31521' title='31521'>The key of the outer door, the key of the office, and the key of the safe.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31522' title='31522'>'Only Sir James Walter and you had those keys?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31523' title='31523'>'I had no keys of the doors - only of the safe.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31524' title='31524'>'Was Sir James a man who was orderly in his habits?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31525' title='31525'>'Yes, I think he was. </span>
<span sid='31526' title='31526'>I know that so far as those three keys are concerned he kept them on the same ring. </span>
<span sid='31527' title='31527'>I have often seen them there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31528' title='31528'>'And that ring went with him to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31529' title='31529'>'He said so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31530' title='31530'>'And your key never left your possession?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31531' title='31531'>'Never.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31532' title='31532'>'Then West, if he is the culprit, must have had a duplicate. </span>
<span sid='31533' title='31533'>And yet none was found upon his body. </span>
<span sid='31534' title='31534'>One other point: if a clerk in this office desired to sell the plans, would it not be simpler to copy the plans for himself than to take the originals, as was actually done?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31535' title='31535'>'It would take considerable technical knowledge to copy the plans in an effective way.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31536' title='31536'>'But I suppose either Sir James, or you, or West had that technical knowledge?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31537' title='31537'>'No doubt we had, but I beg you won't try to drag me into the matter, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='31538' title='31538'>What is the use of our speculating in this way when the original plans were actually found on West?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31539' title='31539'>'Well, it is certainly singular that he should run the risk of taking originals if he could safely have taken copies, which would have equally served his turn.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31540' title='31540'>'Singular, no doubt - and yet he did so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31541' title='31541'>'Every inquiry in this case reveals something inexplicable. </span>
<span sid='31542' title='31542'>Now there are three papers still missing. </span>
<span sid='31543' title='31543'>They are, as I understand, the vital ones.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31544' title='31544'>'Yes, that is so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31545' title='31545'>'Do you mean to say that anyone holding these three papers, and without the seven others, could construct a Bruce-Partington submarine?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31546' title='31546'>'I reported to that effect to the Admiralty. </span>
<span sid='31547' title='31547'>But to-day I have been over the drawings again, and I am not so sure of it. </span>
<span sid='31548' title='31548'>The double valves with the automatic self-adjusting slots are drawn in one of the papers which have been returned. </span>
<span sid='31549' title='31549'>Until the foreigners had invented that for themselves they could not make the boat. </span>
<span sid='31550' title='31550'>Of course, they might soon get over the difficulty.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31551' title='31551'>'But the three missing drawings are the most important?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31552' title='31552'>'Undoubtedly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31553' title='31553'>'I think, with your permission, I will now take a stroll round the premises. </span>
<span sid='31554' title='31554'>I do not recall any other question which I desired to ask.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31555' title='31555'>He examined the lock of the safe, the door of the room, and finally the iron shutters of the window. </span>
<span sid='31556' title='31556'>It was only when we were on the lawn outside that his interest was strongly excited. </span>
<span sid='31557' title='31557'>There was a laurel bush outside the window, and several of the branches bore signs of having been twisted or snapped. </span>
<span sid='31558' title='31558'>He examined them carefully with his lens, and then some dim and vague marks upon the earth beneath. </span>
<span sid='31559' title='31559'>Finally he asked the chief clerk to close the iron shutters, and he pointed out to me that they hardly met in the centre, and that it would be possible for anyone outside to see what was going on within the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31560' title='31560'>'The indications are ruined by the three days' delay. </span>
<span sid='31561' title='31561'>They may mean something or nothing. </span>
<span sid='31562' title='31562'>Well, Watson, I do not think that <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Woolwich&t=h'>Woolwich</a> can help us further. </span>
<span sid='31563' title='31563'>It is a small crop which we have gathered. </span>
<span sid='31564' title='31564'>Let us see if we can do better in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31565' title='31565'>Yet we added one more sheaf to our harvest before we left <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Woolwich&t=h'>Woolwich</a> Station. </span>
<span sid='31566' title='31566'>The clerk in the ticket office was able to say with confidence that he saw Cadogan West - whom he knew well by sight - upon the Monday night, and that he went to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> by the 8.15 to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> Bridge. </span>
<span sid='31567' title='31567'>He was alone, and took a single third-class ticket. </span>
<span sid='31568' title='31568'>The clerk was struck at the time by his excited and nervous manner. </span>
<span sid='31569' title='31569'>So shaky was he that he could hardly pick up his change, and the clerk had helped him with it. </span>
<span sid='31570' title='31570'>A reference to the time-table showed that the 8.15 was the first train which it was possible for West to take after he had left the lady about 7.30.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31571' title='31571'>'Let us reconstruct, Watson,' said Holmes, after half an hour of silence. </span>
<span sid='31572' title='31572'>'I am not aware that in all our joint researches we have ever had a case which was more difficult to get at. </span>
<span sid='31573' title='31573'>Every fresh advance which we make only reveals a fresh ridge beyond. </span>
<span sid='31574' title='31574'>And yet we have surely made some appreciable progress.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31575' title='31575'>'The effect of our inquiries at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Woolwich&t=h'>Woolwich</a> has in the main been against young Cadogan West, but the indications at the window would lend themselves to a more favourable hypothesis. </span>
<span sid='31576' title='31576'>Let us suppose, for example, that he had been approached by some foreign agent. </span>
<span sid='31577' title='31577'>It might have been done under such pledges as would have prevented him from speaking of it, and yet would have affected his thoughts in the direction indicated by his remarks to his fiancée. </span>
<span sid='31578' title='31578'>Very good. </span>
<span sid='31579' title='31579'>We will now suppose that as he went to the theatre with the young lady he suddenly, in the fog, caught a glimpse of this same agent going in the direction of the office. </span>
<span sid='31580' title='31580'>He was an impetuous man, quick in his decisions. </span>
<span sid='31581' title='31581'>Everything gave way to his duty. </span>
<span sid='31582' title='31582'>He followed the man, reached the window, saw the abstraction of the documents, and pursued the thief. </span>
<span sid='31583' title='31583'>In this way we get over the objection that no one would take originals when he could make copies. </span>
<span sid='31584' title='31584'>This outsider had to take originals. </span>
<span sid='31585' title='31585'>So far it holds together.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31586' title='31586'>'What is the next step?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31587' title='31587'>'Then we come into difficulties. </span>
<span sid='31588' title='31588'>One would imagine that under such circumstances the first act of young Cadogan West would be to seize the villain and raise the alarm. </span>
<span sid='31589' title='31589'>Why did he not do so? </span>
<span sid='31590' title='31590'>Could it have been an official superior who took the papers? </span>
<span sid='31591' title='31591'>That would explain West's conduct. </span>
<span sid='31592' title='31592'>Or could the thief have given West the slip in the fog, and West started at once to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> to head him off from his own rooms, presuming that he knew where the rooms were? </span>
<span sid='31593' title='31593'>The call must have been very pressing, since he left his girl standing in the fog, and made no effort to communicate with her. </span>
<span sid='31594' title='31594'>Our scent runs cold here, and there is a vast gap between either hypothesis and the laying of West's body, with seven papers in his pocket, on the roof of a Metropolitan train. </span>
<span sid='31595' title='31595'>My instinct now is to work from the other end. </span>
<span sid='31596' title='31596'>If Mycroft has given us the list of addresses we may be able to pick our man, and follow two tracks instead of one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31597' title='31597'>Surely enough, a note awaited us at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='31598' title='31598'>A Government messenger had brought it post-haste. </span>
<span sid='31599' title='31599'>Holmes glanced at it and threw it over to me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31600' title='31600'>There are numerous small fry, but few who would handle so big an affair. </span>
<span sid='31601' title='31601'>The only men worth considering are Adolph Meyer, of 13, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Great George Street&t=h'>Great George Street</a>, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Westminster&t=h'>Westminster</a>, Louis La Rothière, of Campden Mansions, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Notting Hill&t=h'>Notting Hill</a>, and Hugo Oberstein, 13, Caulfield Gardens, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kensington&t=h'>Kensington</a>. </span>
<span sid='31602' title='31602'>The latter was known to be in town in Monday, and is now reported as having left. </span>
<span sid='31603' title='31603'>Glad to hear you have seen some light. </span>
<span sid='31604' title='31604'>The Cabinet awaits your final report with the utmost anxiety. </span>
<span sid='31605' title='31605'>Urgent representations have arrived from the very highest quarter. </span>
<span sid='31606' title='31606'>The whole force of the State is at your back if you should need it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31607' title='31607'>MYCROFT</span>
<p>
<span sid='31608' title='31608'>'I'm afraid,' said Holmes, smiling, 'that all the Queen's horses and all the Queen's men cannot avail in this matter.' </span>
<span sid='31609' title='31609'>He had spread out his big map of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, and leaned eagerly over it. </span>
<span sid='31610' title='31610'>'Well, well,' said he presently, with an exclamation of satisfaction, 'things are turning a little in our direction at last. </span>
<span sid='31611' title='31611'>Why, Watson, I do honestly believe that we are going to pull it off after all.' </span>
<span sid='31612' title='31612'>He slapped me on the shoulder with a sudden burst of hilarity. </span>
<span sid='31613' title='31613'>'I am going out now. </span>
<span sid='31614' title='31614'>It is only a reconnaissance. </span>
<span sid='31615' title='31615'>I will do nothing serious without my trusted comrade and biographer at my elbow.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31616' title='31616'>Do you stay here, and the odds are that you will see me again in an hour or two. </span>
<span sid='31617' title='31617'>If time hangs heavy get foolscap and a pen, and begin your narrative of how we saved the State.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31618' title='31618'>I felt some reflection of his elation in my own mind, for I knew well that he would not depart so far from his usual austerity of demeanour unless there was good cause for exultation. </span>
<span sid='31619' title='31619'>All the long November evening I waited, fined with impatience for his return. </span>
<span sid='31620' title='31620'>At last, shortly after nine o'clock there arrived a messenger with a note:</span>
<p>
<span sid='31621' title='31621'>Am dining at Goldini's Restaurant, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Gloucester&t=h'>Gloucester</a> Road, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kensington&t=h'>Kensington</a>. </span>
<span sid='31622' title='31622'>Please come at once and join me there. </span>
<span sid='31623' title='31623'>Bring with you a jemmy, a dark lantern, a chisel, and a revolver.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31624' title='31624'>S. H.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31625' title='31625'>It was a nice equipment for a respectable citizen to carry through the dim, fog-draped streets. </span>
<span sid='31626' title='31626'>I stowed them all discreetly away in my overcoat, and drove straight to the address given. </span>
<span sid='31627' title='31627'>There sat my friend at a little round table near the door of the garish Italian restaurant.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31628' title='31628'>'Have you had something to eat? </span>
<span sid='31629' title='31629'>Then join me in a coffee and curaçao. </span>
<span sid='31630' title='31630'>Try one of the proprietor's cigars. </span>
<span sid='31631' title='31631'>They are less poisonous than one would expect. </span>
<span sid='31632' title='31632'>Have you the tools?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31633' title='31633'>'They are here, in my overcoat.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31634' title='31634'>'Excellent. </span>
<span sid='31635' title='31635'>Let me give you a short sketch of what I have done, with some indication of what we are about to do. </span>
<span sid='31636' title='31636'>Now it must be evident to you, Watson, that this young man's body was placed on the roof of the train. </span>
<span sid='31637' title='31637'>That was clear from the instant that I determined the fact that it was from the roof, and not from a carriage, that he had fallen.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31638' title='31638'>'Could it not have been dropped from a bridge?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31639' title='31639'>'I should say it was impossible. </span>
<span sid='31640' title='31640'>If you examine the roofs you will find that they are slightly rounded, and there is no railing round them. </span>
<span sid='31641' title='31641'>Therefore, we can say for certain that young Cadogan West was placed on it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31642' title='31642'>'How could he be placed there?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31643' title='31643'>'That was the question which we had to answer. </span>
<span sid='31644' title='31644'>There is only one possible way. </span>
<span sid='31645' title='31645'>You are aware that the Underground runs clear of tunnels at some points in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the West&t=h'>the West</a>-end. </span>
<span sid='31646' title='31646'>I had a vague memory that as I have travelled by it I have occasionally seen windows just above my head. </span>
<span sid='31647' title='31647'>Now, suppose that a train halted under such a window, would there be any difficulty in laying a body upon the roof?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31648' title='31648'>'It seems most improbable.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31649' title='31649'>'We must fall back upon the old axiom that when all other contingencies fail, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. </span>
<span sid='31650' title='31650'>Here all other contingencies ham failed. </span>
<span sid='31651' title='31651'>When I found that the leading international agent, who had just left <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, lived in a row of houses which abutted upon the Underground, I was so pleased that you were a little astonished at my sudden frivolity.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31652' title='31652'>'Oh, that was it, was it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31653' title='31653'>'Yes, that was it. </span>
<span sid='31654' title='31654'>Mr Hugo Oberstein, of 13, Caulfield Gardens, had become my objective. </span>
<span sid='31655' title='31655'>I began my operations at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Gloucester&t=h'>Gloucester</a> Road Station, where a very helpful official walked with me along the track, and allowed me to satisfy myself, not only that the back-stair windows of Caulfield Gardens open on the line, but the even more essential fact that, owing to the intersection of one of the larger railways, the Underground trains are frequently held motionless for some minutes at that very spot.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31656' title='31656'>'Splendid, Holmes! </span>
<span sid='31657' title='31657'>You have got it!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31658' title='31658'>'So far - so far, Watson. </span>
<span sid='31659' title='31659'>We advance, but the goal is afar. </span>
<span sid='31660' title='31660'>Well, having seen the back of Caulfield Gardens, I visited the front and satisfied myself that the bird was indeed flown. </span>
<span sid='31661' title='31661'>It is a considerable house, unfurnished, so far as I could judge, in the upper rooms. </span>
<span sid='31662' title='31662'>Oberstein lived there with a single valet, who was probably a confederate entirely in his confidence. </span>
<span sid='31663' title='31663'>We must bear in mind that Oberstein has gone to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Continent&t=h'>the Continent</a> to dispose of his booty, but not with any idea of flight, for he had no reason to fear a warrant, and the idea of an amateur domiciliary visit would certainly never occur to him. </span>
<span sid='31664' title='31664'>Yet this is precisely what we are about to make.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31665' title='31665'>'Could we not get a warrant and legalize it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31666' title='31666'>'Hardly on the evidence.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31667' title='31667'>'What can we hope to do?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31668' title='31668'>'We cannot tell what correspondence may be there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31669' title='31669'>'I don't like it, Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31670' title='31670'>'My dear fellow, you shall keep watch in the street. </span>
<span sid='31671' title='31671'>I'll do the criminal part. </span>
<span sid='31672' title='31672'>It's not a time to stick at trifles. </span>
<span sid='31673' title='31673'>Think of Mycroft's note, of the Admiralty, the Cabinet, the exalted person who waits for news. </span>
<span sid='31674' title='31674'>We are bound to go.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31675' title='31675'>My answer was to rise from the table.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31676' title='31676'>'You are right, Holmes. </span>
<span sid='31677' title='31677'>We are bound to go.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31678' title='31678'>He sprang up and shook me by the hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31679' title='31679'>'I knew you would not shrink at the last,' said he, and for a moment I saw something in his eyes which was nearer to tenderness than I had ever seen. </span>
<span sid='31680' title='31680'>The next instant he was his masterful, practical self once more.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31681' title='31681'>'It is nearly half a mile, but there is no hurry. </span>
<span sid='31682' title='31682'>Let us walk,' said he. </span>
<span sid='31683' title='31683'>'Don't drop the instruments, I beg. </span>
<span sid='31684' title='31684'>Your arrest as a suspicious character would be a most unfortunate complication.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31685' title='31685'>Caulfield Gardens was one of those lines of flat-faced, pillared, and porticoed houses which are so prominent a product of the middle <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Victoria&t=h'>Victoria</a>n epoch in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the West&t=h'>the West</a> End of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='31686' title='31686'>Next door there appeared to be a children's party, for the merry buzz of young voices and the clatter of a piano resounded through the night. </span>
<span sid='31687' title='31687'>The fog still hung about and screened us with its friendly shade. </span>
<span sid='31688' title='31688'>Holmes had lit his lantern and flashed it upon the massive door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31689' title='31689'>'This is a serious proposition,' said he. </span>
<span sid='31690' title='31690'>'It is certainly bolted as well as locked. </span>
<span sid='31691' title='31691'>We would do better in the area. </span>
<span sid='31692' title='31692'>There is an excellent archway down yonder in case a too zealous policeman should intrude. </span>
<span sid='31693' title='31693'>Give me a hand, Watson, and I'll do the same for you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31694' title='31694'>A minute later we were both in the area. </span>
<span sid='31695' title='31695'>Hardly had we reached the dark shadows before the step of the policeman was heard in the fog above. </span>
<span sid='31696' title='31696'>As its soft rhythm died away, Holmes set to work upon the lower door. </span>
<span sid='31697' title='31697'>I saw him stoop and strain until with a sharp crash it flew open. </span>
<span sid='31698' title='31698'>We sprang through into the dark passage, closing the area door behind us. </span>
<span sid='31699' title='31699'>Holmes led the way up the curving, uncarpeted stair. </span>
<span sid='31700' title='31700'>His little fan of yellow fight shone upon a low window.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31701' title='31701'>'Here we are, Watson - this must be the one.' </span>
<span sid='31702' title='31702'>He threw it open, and as he did so there was a low, harsh murmur, growing steadily into a loud roar as a train dashed past us in the darkness. </span>
<span sid='31703' title='31703'>Holmes swept his fight along the windowsill. </span>
<span sid='31704' title='31704'>It was thickly coated with soot from the passing engines, but the black surface was blurred and rubbed in places.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31705' title='31705'>'You can see where they rested the body. </span>
<span sid='31706' title='31706'>Hullo, Watson! what is this? </span>
<span sid='31707' title='31707'>There can be no doubt that it is a blood mark.' </span>
<span sid='31708' title='31708'>He was pointing to faint discolorations along the woodwork of the window. </span>
<span sid='31709' title='31709'>'Here it is on the stone of the stair also. </span>
<span sid='31710' title='31710'>The demonstration is complete. </span>
<span sid='31711' title='31711'>Let us stay here until a train stops.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31712' title='31712'>We had not long to wait. </span>
<span sid='31713' title='31713'>The very next train roared from the tunnel as before, but slowed in the open, and then, with a creaking of brakes, pulled up immediately beneath us. </span>
<span sid='31714' title='31714'>It was not four feet from the window-ledge to the roof of the carriages. </span>
<span sid='31715' title='31715'>Holmes softly closed the window.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31716' title='31716'>'So far we are justified,' said he. </span>
<span sid='31717' title='31717'>'What do you think of it, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31718' title='31718'>'A masterpiece. </span>
<span sid='31719' title='31719'>You have never risen to a greater height.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31720' title='31720'>'I cannot agree with you there. </span>
<span sid='31721' title='31721'>From the moment that I conceived the idea of the body being upon the roof, which surely was not a very abstruse one, all the rest was inevitable. </span>
<span sid='31722' title='31722'>If it were not for the grave interests involved, the affair up to this point would be insignificant. </span>
<span sid='31723' title='31723'>Our difficulties are still before us. </span>
<span sid='31724' title='31724'>But perhaps we may find something here which may help us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31725' title='31725'>We had ascended the kitchen stair and entered the suite of rooms upon the first floor. </span>
<span sid='31726' title='31726'>One was a dining-room, severely furnished and containing nothing of interest. </span>
<span sid='31727' title='31727'>A second was a bedroom, which also drew blank. </span>
<span sid='31728' title='31728'>The remaining room appeared more promising, and my companion settled down to a systematic examination. </span>
<span sid='31729' title='31729'>It was littered with books and papers, and was evidently used as a study. </span>
<span sid='31730' title='31730'>Swiftly and methodically Holmes turned over the contents of drawer after drawer and cupboard after cupboard, but no gleam of success came to brighten his austere face. </span>
<span sid='31731' title='31731'>At the end of an hour he was no further than when he started.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31732' title='31732'>'The cunning dog has covered his tracks,' said he. </span>
<span sid='31733' title='31733'>'He has left nothing to incriminate him. </span>
<span sid='31734' title='31734'>His dangerous correspondence has been destroyed or removed. </span>
<span sid='31735' title='31735'>This is our last chance.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31736' title='31736'>It was a small tin cash-box which stood upon the writing-desk. </span>
<span sid='31737' title='31737'>Holmes prised it open with his chisel. </span>
<span sid='31738' title='31738'>Several rolls of paper were within, covered with figures and calculations, without any note to show to what they referred. </span>
<span sid='31739' title='31739'>The recurring words, 'Water pressure' and 'Pressure to the square inch' suggested some possible relation to a submarine. </span>
<span sid='31740' title='31740'>Holmes tossed them all impatiently aside. </span>
<span sid='31741' title='31741'>There only remained an envelope with some small newspaper slips inside it. </span>
<span sid='31742' title='31742'>He shook them out on the table, and at once I saw by his eager face that his hopes had been raised.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31743' title='31743'>'What's this, Watson? </span>
<span sid='31744' title='31744'>Eh? </span>
<span sid='31745' title='31745'>What's this? </span>
<span sid='31746' title='31746'>Record of a series of messages in the advertisements of a paper. </span>
<span sid='31747' title='31747'>Daily Telegraph agony column by the print and paper. </span>
<span sid='31748' title='31748'>Right-hand top corner of a page. </span>
<span sid='31749' title='31749'>No date - but messages arrange themselves. </span>
<span sid='31750' title='31750'>This must be the first:</span>
<p>
<span sid='31751' title='31751'>'"Hoped to hear sooner. </span>
<span sid='31752' title='31752'>Terms agreed to. </span>
<span sid='31753' title='31753'>Write fully to address given on card. </span>
<span sid='31754' title='31754'>- Pierrot."</span>
<p>
<span sid='31755' title='31755'>'Next comes:</span>
<p>
<span sid='31756' title='31756'>"Too complex for description. </span>
<span sid='31757' title='31757'>Must have full report. </span>
<span sid='31758' title='31758'>Stuff awaits you when goods delivered. </span>
<span sid='31759' title='31759'>- Pierrot."</span>
<p>
<span sid='31760' title='31760'>'Then comes:</span>
<p>
<span sid='31761' title='31761'>"Matter presses. </span>
<span sid='31762' title='31762'>Must withdraw offer unless contract completed. </span>
<span sid='31763' title='31763'>Make appointment by letter. </span>
<span sid='31764' title='31764'>Will confirm by advertisement. </span>
<span sid='31765' title='31765'>- Pierrot."</span>
<p>
<span sid='31766' title='31766'>'Finally:</span>
<p>
<span sid='31767' title='31767'>"Monday night after nine. </span>
<span sid='31768' title='31768'>Two taps. </span>
<span sid='31769' title='31769'>Only ourselves. </span>
<span sid='31770' title='31770'>Do not be so suspicious. </span>
<span sid='31771' title='31771'>Payment in hard cash when goods delivered. </span>
<span sid='31772' title='31772'>- Pierrot."</span>
<p>
<span sid='31773' title='31773'>'A fairly complete record, Watson! </span>
<span sid='31774' title='31774'>If we could only get at the man at the other end!' </span>
<span sid='31775' title='31775'>He sat lost in thought, tapping his fingers on the table. </span>
<span sid='31776' title='31776'>Finally he sprang to his feet.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31777' title='31777'>'Well, perhaps it won't be so difficult after all. </span>
<span sid='31778' title='31778'>There is nothing more to be done here, Watson. </span>
<span sid='31779' title='31779'>I think we might drive round to the offices of the Daily Telegraph, and so bring a good day's work to a conclusion.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31780' title='31780'>Mycroft Holmes and Lestrade had come round by appointment after breakfast next day, and Sherlock Holmes had recounted to them our proceedings of the day before. </span>
<span sid='31781' title='31781'>The professional shook his head over our confessed burglary.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31782' title='31782'>'We can't do these things in the force, Mr Holmes,' said he. </span>
<span sid='31783' title='31783'>'No wonder you get results that are beyond us. </span>
<span sid='31784' title='31784'>But some of these days you'll go too far, and you'll find yourself and your friend in trouble.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31785' title='31785'>'For <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, home and beauty - eh, Watson? </span>
<span sid='31786' title='31786'>Martyrs on the altar of our country. </span>
<span sid='31787' title='31787'>But what do you think of it, Mycroft?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31788' title='31788'>'Excellent, Sherlock! </span>
<span sid='31789' title='31789'>Admirable! </span>
<span sid='31790' title='31790'>But what use will you make of it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31791' title='31791'>Holmes picked up the Daily Telegraph which lay upon the table.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31792' title='31792'>'Have you seen Pierrot's advertisement today?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31793' title='31793'>'What! </span>
<span sid='31794' title='31794'>Another one?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31795' title='31795'>'Yes, here it is: </span>
<span sid='31796' title='31796'>"Tonight. </span>
<span sid='31797' title='31797'>Same hour. </span>
<span sid='31798' title='31798'>Same place. </span>
<span sid='31799' title='31799'>Two taps. </span>
<span sid='31800' title='31800'>Most vitally important. </span>
<span sid='31801' title='31801'>Your own safety at stake. </span>
<span sid='31802' title='31802'>- Pierrot."'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31803' title='31803'>'By George!' cried Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='31804' title='31804'>'If he answers that we've got him!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31805' title='31805'>'That was my idea when I put it in. </span>
<span sid='31806' title='31806'>I think if you could both make it convenient to come with us about eight o'clock to Caulfield Gardens we might possibly get a little nearer to a solution.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31807' title='31807'>One of the most remarkable characteristics of Sherlock Holmes was his power of throwing his brain out of action and switching all his thoughts on to lighter things whenever he had convinced himself that he could no longer work to advantage. </span>
<span sid='31808' title='31808'>I remember that during the whole of that memorable day he lost himself in a monograph which he had undertaken upon the Polyphonic Motets of Lassus. </span>
<span sid='31809' title='31809'>For my own part I had none of this power of detachment, and the day, in consequence, appeared to be interminable. </span>
<span sid='31810' title='31810'>The great national importance of the issue, the suspense in high quarters, the direct nature of the experiment which we were trying, all combined to work upon my nerves. </span>
<span sid='31811' title='31811'>It was a relief to me when at last, after a light dinner, we set out upon our expedition. </span>
<span sid='31812' title='31812'>Lestrade and Mycroft met us by appointment at the outside of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Gloucester&t=h'>Gloucester</a> Road Station. </span>
<span sid='31813' title='31813'>The area door of Oberstein's house had been left open the night before, and it was necessary for me, as Mycroft Holmes absolutely and indignantly declined to climb the railings, to pass in and open the hall door. </span>
<span sid='31814' title='31814'>By nine o'clock we were all seated in the study, waiting patiently for our man.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31815' title='31815'>An hour passed and yet another. </span>
<span sid='31816' title='31816'>When eleven struck the measured beat of the great church clock seemed to sound the dirge of our hopes. </span>
<span sid='31817' title='31817'>Lestrade and Mycroft were fidgeting in their seats and looking twice a minute at their watches. </span>
<span sid='31818' title='31818'>Holmes sat silent and composed, his eyelids half shut, but every sense on the alert. </span>
<span sid='31819' title='31819'>He raised his head with a sudden jerk.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31820' title='31820'>'He is coming,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31821' title='31821'>There had been a furtive step past the door. </span>
<span sid='31822' title='31822'>Now it returned. </span>
<span sid='31823' title='31823'>We heard a shuffling sound outside, and then two sharp taps with the knocker. </span>
<span sid='31824' title='31824'>Holmes rose, motioning to us to remain seated. </span>
<span sid='31825' title='31825'>The gas in the hall was a mere point of light. </span>
<span sid='31826' title='31826'>He opened the outer door, and then as a dark figure slipped past him he closed and fastened it. </span>
<span sid='31827' title='31827'>'This way!' we heard him say, and a moment later our man stood before us. </span>
<span sid='31828' title='31828'>Holmes had followed him closely, and as the man turned with a cry of surprise and alarm he caught him by the collar and threw him back into the room. </span>
<span sid='31829' title='31829'>Before our prisoner had recovered his balance the door was shut and Holmes standing with his back against it. </span>
<span sid='31830' title='31830'>The man glared round him, staggered, and fell senseless upon the floor. </span>
<span sid='31831' title='31831'>With the shock, his broad-brimmed hat flew from his head, his cravat slipped down from his lips, and there was the long light beard and the soft, handsome, delicate features of Colonel Valentine Walter.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31832' title='31832'>Holmes gave a whistle of surprise.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31833' title='31833'>'You can write me down an ass this time, Watson,' said he. </span>
<span sid='31834' title='31834'>'This was not the bird that I was looking for.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31835' title='31835'>'Who is he?' asked Mycroft, eagerly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31836' title='31836'>'The younger brother of the late Sir James Walter, the head of the Submarine Department. </span>
<span sid='31837' title='31837'>Yes, yes, I see the fall of the cards. </span>
<span sid='31838' title='31838'>He is coming to. </span>
<span sid='31839' title='31839'>I think that you had best leave his examination to me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31840' title='31840'>We had carried the prostrate body to the sofa. </span>
<span sid='31841' title='31841'>Now our prisoner sat up, looked round him with a horror-stricken face, and passed his hand over his forehead, like one who cannot believe his own senses.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31842' title='31842'>'What is this?' he asked. </span>
<span sid='31843' title='31843'>'I came here to visit Mr Oberstein.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31844' title='31844'>'Everything is known, Colonel Walter,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='31845' title='31845'>'How an English gentleman could behave in such a manner is beyond my comprehension. </span>
<span sid='31846' title='31846'>But your whole correspondence and relations with Oberstein are within our knowledge. </span>
<span sid='31847' title='31847'>So also are the circumstances connected with the death of young Cadogan West. </span>
<span sid='31848' title='31848'>Let me advise you to gain at least the small credit for repentance and confession, since there are still some details which we can only learn from your lips.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31849' title='31849'>The man groaned and sank his face in his hands. </span>
<span sid='31850' title='31850'>We waited, but he was silent.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31851' title='31851'>'I can assure you,' said Holmes, 'that every essential is already known. </span>
<span sid='31852' title='31852'>We know that you were pressed for money, that you took an impress of the keys which your brother held, and that you entered into a correspondence with Oberstein, who answered your letters through the advertisement columns of the Daily Telegraph. </span>
<span sid='31853' title='31853'>We are aware that you went down to the office in the fog of Monday night, but that you were seen and followed by young Cadogan West, who had probably some previous reason to suspect you. </span>
<span sid='31854' title='31854'>He saw your theft, but could not give the alarm, as it was just possible that you were taking the papers to your brother in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='31855' title='31855'>Leaving all his private concerns, like the good citizen that he was, he followed you closely in the fog, and kept at your heels until you reached this very house. </span>
<span sid='31856' title='31856'>There he intervened, and then it was, Colonel Walter, that to treason you added the more terrible crime of murder.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31857' title='31857'>'I did not! </span>
<span sid='31858' title='31858'>I did not! </span>
<span sid='31859' title='31859'>Before God I swear that I did not!' cried our wretched prisoner.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31860' title='31860'>'Tell us, then, how Cadogan West met his end before you laid him upon the roof of a railway carriage.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31861' title='31861'>'I will. </span>
<span sid='31862' title='31862'>I swear to you that I will. </span>
<span sid='31863' title='31863'>I did the rest. </span>
<span sid='31864' title='31864'>I confess it. </span>
<span sid='31865' title='31865'>It was just as you say. </span>
<span sid='31866' title='31866'>A Stock Exchange debt had to be paid. </span>
<span sid='31867' title='31867'>I needed the money badly. </span>
<span sid='31868' title='31868'>Oberstein offered me five thousand. </span>
<span sid='31869' title='31869'>It was to save myself from ruin. </span>
<span sid='31870' title='31870'>But as to murder, I am as innocent as you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31871' title='31871'>'What happened then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31872' title='31872'>'He had his suspicions before, and he followed me as you describe. </span>
<span sid='31873' title='31873'>I never knew it until I was at the very door. </span>
<span sid='31874' title='31874'>It was thick fog, and one could not see three yards. </span>
<span sid='31875' title='31875'>I had given two taps and Oberstein had come to the door. </span>
<span sid='31876' title='31876'>The young man rushed up and demanded to know what we were about to do with the papers. </span>
<span sid='31877' title='31877'>Oberstein had a short life-preserver. </span>
<span sid='31878' title='31878'>He always carried it with him. </span>
<span sid='31879' title='31879'>As West forced his way after us into the house Oberstein struck him on the head. </span>
<span sid='31880' title='31880'>The blow was a fatal one. </span>
<span sid='31881' title='31881'>He was dead within five minutes. </span>
<span sid='31882' title='31882'>There he lay in the hall, and we were at our wits' end what to do. </span>
<span sid='31883' title='31883'>Then Oberstein had this idea about the trains which halted under his back window. </span>
<span sid='31884' title='31884'>But first he examined the papers which I had brought. </span>
<span sid='31885' title='31885'>He said that three of them were essential, and that he must keep them. </span>
<span sid='31886' title='31886'>"You cannot keep them," said I. </span>
<span sid='31887' title='31887'>"There will be a dreadful row at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Woolwich&t=h'>Woolwich</a> if they are not returned.""I must keep them," said he, "for they are so technical that it is impossible in the time to make copies." </span>
<span sid='31888' title='31888'>"Then they must all go back together to-night," said I. </span>
<span sid='31889' title='31889'>He thought for a little, and then he cried out that he had it. </span>
<span sid='31890' title='31890'>"Three I will keep," said he. </span>
<span sid='31891' title='31891'>"The others we will stuff into the pocket of this young man. </span>
<span sid='31892' title='31892'>When he is found the whole business will assuredly be put to his account." </span>
<span sid='31893' title='31893'>I could see no other way out of it, so we did as he suggested. </span>
<span sid='31894' title='31894'>We waited half an hour at the window before a train stopped. </span>
<span sid='31895' title='31895'>It was so thick that nothing could be seen, and we had no difficulty in lowering West's body on to the train. </span>
<span sid='31896' title='31896'>That was the end of the matter so far as I was concerned.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31897' title='31897'>'And your brother?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31898' title='31898'>'He said nothing, but he had caught me once with his keys, and I think that he suspected. </span>
<span sid='31899' title='31899'>I read in his eyes that he suspected. </span>
<span sid='31900' title='31900'>As you know, he never held up his head again.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31901' title='31901'>There was silence in the room. </span>
<span sid='31902' title='31902'>It was broken by Mycroft Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31903' title='31903'>'Can you not make reparation? </span>
<span sid='31904' title='31904'>It would ease your conscience, and possibly your punishment.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31905' title='31905'>'What reparation can I make?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31906' title='31906'>'Where is Oberstein with the papers?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31907' title='31907'>'I do not know.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31908' title='31908'>'Did he give you no address?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31909' title='31909'>'He said that letters to the Hôtel du Louvre, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Paris&t=h'>Paris</a>, would eventually reach him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31910' title='31910'>'Then reparation is still within your power,' said Sherlock Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31911' title='31911'>'I will do anything I can. </span>
<span sid='31912' title='31912'>I owe this fellow no particular good-will. </span>
<span sid='31913' title='31913'>He has been my ruin and my downfall.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31914' title='31914'>'Here are paper and pen. </span>
<span sid='31915' title='31915'>Sit at this desk and write to my dictation. </span>
<span sid='31916' title='31916'>Direct the envelope to the address given. </span>
<span sid='31917' title='31917'>That is right. </span>
<span sid='31918' title='31918'>Now the letter: </span>
<span sid='31919' title='31919'>"Dear Sir, - With regard to our transaction, you will no doubt have observed by now that one essential detail is missing. </span>
<span sid='31920' title='31920'>I have a tracing which will make it complete. </span>
<span sid='31921' title='31921'>This has involved me in extra trouble, however, and I must ask you for a further advance of five hundred pounds. </span>
<span sid='31922' title='31922'>I will not trust it to the post, nor will I take anything but gold or notes. </span>
<span sid='31923' title='31923'>I would come to you abroad, but it would excite remark if I left the country at present. </span>
<span sid='31924' title='31924'>Therefore I shall expect to meet you in the smoking-room of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Charing Cross&t=h'>Charing Cross</a> Hotel at noon on Saturday. </span>
<span sid='31925' title='31925'>Remember that only English notes, or gold, will be taken." </span>
<span sid='31926' title='31926'>That will do very well. </span>
<span sid='31927' title='31927'>I shall be very much surprised if it does not fetch our man.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='31928' title='31928'>And it did! </span>
<span sid='31929' title='31929'>It is a matter of history - that secret history of a nation which is often so much more intimate and interesting than its public chronicles - that Oberstein, eager to complete the coup of his lifetime, came to the lure and was safely engulfed for fifteen years in a British prison. </span>
<span sid='31930' title='31930'>In his trunk were found the invaluable Bruce-Partington plans, which he had put up for auction in all the naval centres of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='31931' title='31931'>Colonel Walter died in prison towards the end of the second year of his sentence. </span>
<span sid='31932' title='31932'>As to Holmes, he returned refreshed to his monograph upon the Polyphonic Motets of Lassus, which has since been printed for private circulation, and is said by experts to be the last word upon the subject. </span>
<span sid='31933' title='31933'>Some weeks afterwards I learned incidentally that my friend spent a day at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Windsor&t=h'>Windsor</a>, whence he returned with a remarkably fine emerald tie-pin. </span>
<span sid='31934' title='31934'>When I asked him if he had bought it, he answered that it was a present from a certain gracious lady in whose interests he had once been fortunate enough to carry out a small commission. </span>
<span sid='31935' title='31935'>He said no more, but I fancy that I could guess at the lady's august name, and I have little doubt that the emerald pin will for ever recall to my friend's memory the adventure of the Bruce-Partington plans.</span>
