<p class="subtitle">Arthur Conan Doyle<label for="sn-meta-last" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-meta-last" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><!--googleoff: all--><b>Story Number</b>: 48<br><b>Published in</b>: The Strand Magazine in September 1917<br><b>Collected in</b>: His Last Bow: Some Reminiscences of Sherlock Holmes<!--googleon: all--></span></p>
<p>
<span sid='57378' title='57378'>It was nine o'clock at night upon the second of August - the most terrible August in the history of the world. </span>
<span sid='57379' title='57379'>One might have thought already that God's curse hung heavy over a degenerate world, for there was an awesome hush and a feeling of vague expectancy in the sultry and stagnant air. </span>
<span sid='57380' title='57380'>The sun had long set, but one blood-red gash like an open wound lay low in the distant west. </span>
<span sid='57381' title='57381'>Above, the stars were shining brightly; and below, the lights of the shipping glimmered in the bay. </span>
<span sid='57382' title='57382'>The two famous Germans stood beside the stone parapet of the garden walk, with the long, low, heavily gabled house behind them, and they looked down upon the broad sweep of the beach at the foot of the great chalk cliff on which Von Bork, like some wandering eagle, had perched himself four years before. </span>
<span sid='57383' title='57383'>They stood with their heads close together, talking in low, confidential tones. </span>
<span sid='57384' title='57384'>From below the two glowing ends of their cigars might have been the smouldering eyes of some malignant fiend looking down in the darkness.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57385' title='57385'>A remarkable man this Von Bork - a man who could hardly be matched among all the devoted agents of the Kaiser. </span>
<span sid='57386' title='57386'>It was his talents which had first recommended him for the English mission, the most important mission of all, but since he had taken it over, those talents had become more and more manifest to the half-dozen people in the world who were really in touch with the truth. </span>
<span sid='57387' title='57387'>One of these was his present companion, Baron Von Herling, the chief secretary of the legation, whose huge 100-horse-power Benz car was blocking the country lane as it waited to waft its owner back to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57388' title='57388'>'So far as I can judge the trend of events, you will probably be back in Berlin within the week,' the secretary was saying. </span>
<span sid='57389' title='57389'>'When you get there, my dear Von Bork, I think you will be surprised at the welcome you will receive. </span>
<span sid='57390' title='57390'>I happen to know what is thought in the highest quarters of your work in this country.' </span>
<span sid='57391' title='57391'>He was a huge man, the secretary, deep, broad, and tall, with a slow, heavy fashion of speech which had been his main asset in his political career.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57392' title='57392'>Von Bork laughed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57393' title='57393'>'They are not very hard to deceive,' he remarked. </span>
<span sid='57394' title='57394'>'A more docile, simple folk could not be imagined.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57395' title='57395'>'I don't know about that,' said the other thoughtfully. </span>
<span sid='57396' title='57396'>'They have strange limits and one must learn to observe them. </span>
<span sid='57397' title='57397'>It is that surface simplicity of theirs which makes a trap for the stranger. </span>
<span sid='57398' title='57398'>One's first impression is that they are entirely soft. </span>
<span sid='57399' title='57399'>Then one comes suddenly upon something very hard and you know that you have reached the limit, and must adapt yourself to the fact. </span>
<span sid='57400' title='57400'>They have, for example, their insular conventions which simply must be observed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57401' title='57401'>'Meaning, 'good form' and that sort of thing?' </span>
<span sid='57402' title='57402'>Von Bork sighed, as one who had suffered much.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57403' title='57403'>'Meaning British prejudice in all its queer manifestations. </span>
<span sid='57404' title='57404'>As an example I may quote one of my own worst blunders - I can afford to talk of my blunders, for you know my work well enough to be aware of my successes. </span>
<span sid='57405' title='57405'>It was on my first arrival. </span>
<span sid='57406' title='57406'>I was invited to a week-end gathering at the country house of a Cabinet Minister. </span>
<span sid='57407' title='57407'>The conversation was amazingly indiscreet.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57408' title='57408'>Von Bork nodded. </span>
<span sid='57409' title='57409'>'I've been there,' said he dryly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57410' title='57410'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='57411' title='57411'>Well, I naturally sent a résumé of the information to Berlin. </span>
<span sid='57412' title='57412'>Unfortunately our good Chancellor is a little heavy-handed in these matters, and he transmitted a remark which showed that he was aware of what had been said. </span>
<span sid='57413' title='57413'>This, of course, took the trail straight up to me. </span>
<span sid='57414' title='57414'>You've no idea the harm that it did me. </span>
<span sid='57415' title='57415'>There was nothing soft about our British hosts on that occasion, I can assure you. </span>
<span sid='57416' title='57416'>I was two years living it down. </span>
<span sid='57417' title='57417'>Now you, with this sporting pose of yours.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57418' title='57418'>'No, no, don't call it a pose. </span>
<span sid='57419' title='57419'>A pose is an artificial thing. </span>
<span sid='57420' title='57420'>This is quite natural. </span>
<span sid='57421' title='57421'>I am a born sportsman. </span>
<span sid='57422' title='57422'>I enjoy it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57423' title='57423'>'Well, that makes it the more effective. </span>
<span sid='57424' title='57424'>You yacht against them, you hunt with them, you play polo, you match them in every game, your four-in-hand takes the prize at Olympia. </span>
<span sid='57425' title='57425'>I have even heard that you go the length of boxing with the young officers. </span>
<span sid='57426' title='57426'>What is the result? </span>
<span sid='57427' title='57427'>Nobody takes you seriously. </span>
<span sid='57428' title='57428'>You are a "good old sport," "quite a decent fellow for a German," a hard-drinking, night-club, knock-abouttown, devil-may-care young fellow. </span>
<span sid='57429' title='57429'>And all the time this quiet country house of yours is the centre of half the mischief in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, and the sporting squire the most astute Secret Service man in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>. </span>
<span sid='57430' title='57430'>Genius, my dear Von Bork - genius!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57431' title='57431'>'You flatter me, Baron. </span>
<span sid='57432' title='57432'>But certainly I may claim that my four years in this country have not been unproductive. </span>
<span sid='57433' title='57433'>I've never shown you my little store. </span>
<span sid='57434' title='57434'>Would you mind stepping in for a moment?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57435' title='57435'>The door of the study opened straight on to the terrace. </span>
<span sid='57436' title='57436'>Von Bork pushed it back, and, leading the way, he clicked the switch of the electric light. </span>
<span sid='57437' title='57437'>He then closed the door behind the bulky form which followed him, and carefully adjusted the heavy curtain over the latticed window. </span>
<span sid='57438' title='57438'>Only when all these precautions had been taken and tested did he turn his sunburned aquiline face to his guest.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57439' title='57439'>'Some of my papers have gone,' said he; 'when my wife and the household left yesterday for Flushing they took the less important with them. </span>
<span sid='57440' title='57440'>I must, of course, claim the protection of the Embassy for the others.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57441' title='57441'>'Your name has already been filed as one of the personal suite. </span>
<span sid='57442' title='57442'>There will be no difficulties for you or your baggage. </span>
<span sid='57443' title='57443'>Of course, it is just possible that we may not have to go. </span>
<span sid='57444' title='57444'><a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> may leave <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a> to her fate. </span>
<span sid='57445' title='57445'>We are sure that there is no binding treaty between them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57446' title='57446'>'And <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Belgium&t=h'>Belgium</a>?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57447' title='57447'>'Yes, and <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Belgium&t=h'>Belgium</a>, too.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57448' title='57448'>Von Bork shook his head. </span>
<span sid='57449' title='57449'>'I don't see how that could be. </span>
<span sid='57450' title='57450'>There is a definite treaty there. </span>
<span sid='57451' title='57451'>She could never recover from such a humiliation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57452' title='57452'>'She would at least have peace for the moment.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57453' title='57453'>'But her honour?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57454' title='57454'>'Tut, my dear sir, we live in a utilitarian age. </span>
<span sid='57455' title='57455'>Honour is a mediæval conception. </span>
<span sid='57456' title='57456'>Besides <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> is not ready. </span>
<span sid='57457' title='57457'>It is an inconceivable thing, but even our special war tax of fifty millions, which one would think made our purpose as clear as if we had advertised it on the front page of The Times, has not roused these people from their slumbers. </span>
<span sid='57458' title='57458'>Here and there one hears a question. </span>
<span sid='57459' title='57459'>It is my business to find an answer. </span>
<span sid='57460' title='57460'>Here and there also there is an irritation. </span>
<span sid='57461' title='57461'>It is my business to soothe it. </span>
<span sid='57462' title='57462'>But I can assure you that so far as the essentials go - the storage of munitions, the preparation for submarine attack, the arrangements for making high explosives - nothing is prepared. </span>
<span sid='57463' title='57463'>How then can <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> come in, especially when we have stirred her up such a devil's brew of Irish civil war, window-breaking Furies, and God knows what to keep her thoughts at home?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57464' title='57464'>'She must think of her future.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57465' title='57465'>'Ah, that is another matter. </span>
<span sid='57466' title='57466'>I fancy that in the future, we have our own very definite plans about <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, and that your information will be very vital to us. </span>
<span sid='57467' title='57467'>It is to-day or to-morrow with Mr. John Bull. </span>
<span sid='57468' title='57468'>If he prefers to-day we are perfectly ready. </span>
<span sid='57469' title='57469'>If it is tomorrow we shall be more ready still. </span>
<span sid='57470' title='57470'>I should think they would be wiser to fight with allies than without them, but that is their own affair. </span>
<span sid='57471' title='57471'>This week is their week of destiny. </span>
<span sid='57472' title='57472'>But you were speaking of your papers.' </span>
<span sid='57473' title='57473'>He sat in the arm-chair with the light shining upon his broad bald head, while he puffed sedately at his-cigar.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57474' title='57474'>The large oak-panelled book-lined room had a curtain hung in the further corner. </span>
<span sid='57475' title='57475'>When this was drawn it disclosed a large brass-bound safe. </span>
<span sid='57476' title='57476'>Von Bork detached a small key from his watch-chain, and after some considerable manipulation of the lock he swung open the heavy door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57477' title='57477'>'Look!' said he, standing clear, with a wave of his hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57478' title='57478'>The light shone vividly into the opened safe, and the secretary of the Embassy gazed with an absorbed interest at the rows of stuffed pigeon-holes with which it was furnished. </span>
<span sid='57479' title='57479'>Each pigeon-hole had its label, and his eyes as he glanced along them read a long series of such titles as 'Fords,' 'Harbour-defences,' 'Aeroplanes,' '<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ireland&t=h'>Ireland</a>,' 'Egypt,' '<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Portsmouth&t=h'>Portsmouth</a> forts,' '<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=The Channel&t=h'>The Channel</a>,' 'Rosyth,' and a score of others. </span>
<span sid='57480' title='57480'>Each compartment was bristling with papers and plans.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57481' title='57481'>'Colossal!' said the secretary. </span>
<span sid='57482' title='57482'>Putting down his cigar he softly clapped his fat hands.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57483' title='57483'>'And all in four years, Baron. </span>
<span sid='57484' title='57484'>Not such a bad show for the hard-drinking, hard-riding country squire. </span>
<span sid='57485' title='57485'>But the gem of my collection is coming and there is the setting all ready for it.' </span>
<span sid='57486' title='57486'>He pointed to a space over which 'Naval Signals' was printed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57487' title='57487'>'But you have a good dossier there already.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57488' title='57488'>'Out of date and waste paper. </span>
<span sid='57489' title='57489'>The Admiralty in some way got the alarm and every code has been changed. </span>
<span sid='57490' title='57490'>It was a blow, Baron - the worst set-back in my whole campaign. </span>
<span sid='57491' title='57491'>But thanks to my cheque-book and the good Altamont all will be well to-night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57492' title='57492'>The Baron looked at his watch, and gave a guttural exclamation of disappointment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57493' title='57493'>'Well, I really can wait no longer. </span>
<span sid='57494' title='57494'>You can imagine that things are moving at present in Carlton Terrace and that we have all to be at our posts. </span>
<span sid='57495' title='57495'>I had hoped to be able to bring news of your great coup. </span>
<span sid='57496' title='57496'>Did Altamont name no hour?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57497' title='57497'>Von Bork pushed over a telegram.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57498' title='57498'>'Will come without fail to-night and bring new sparking plugs. </span>
<span sid='57499' title='57499'>- ALTAMONT.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57500' title='57500'>'Sparking plugs, eh?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57501' title='57501'>'You see he poses as a motor expert and I keep a full garage. </span>
<span sid='57502' title='57502'>In our code everything likely to come up is named after some spare part. </span>
<span sid='57503' title='57503'>If he talks of a radiator it is a battleship, of an oil-pump a cruiser, and so on. </span>
<span sid='57504' title='57504'>Sparking plugs are naval signals.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57505' title='57505'>'From <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Portsmouth&t=h'>Portsmouth</a> at midday,' said the secretary, examining the superscription. </span>
<span sid='57506' title='57506'>'By the way, what do you give him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57507' title='57507'>'Five hundred pounds for this particular job. </span>
<span sid='57508' title='57508'>Of course he has a salary as well.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57509' title='57509'>'The greedy rogue. </span>
<span sid='57510' title='57510'>They are useful, these traitors, but I grudge them their blood-money.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57511' title='57511'>'I grudge Altamont nothing. </span>
<span sid='57512' title='57512'>He is a wonderful worker. </span>
<span sid='57513' title='57513'>If I pay him well, at least he delivers the goods, to use his own phrase. </span>
<span sid='57514' title='57514'>Besides he is not a traitor. </span>
<span sid='57515' title='57515'>I assure you that our most pan-Germanic Junker is a sucking dove in his feelings towards <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> as compared with a real bitter Irish-<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57516' title='57516'>'Oh, an Irish-<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57517' title='57517'>'If you heard him talk you would not doubt it. </span>
<span sid='57518' title='57518'>Sometimes I assure you I can hardly understand him. </span>
<span sid='57519' title='57519'>He seems to have declared war on the King's English as well as on the English King. </span>
<span sid='57520' title='57520'>Must you really go? </span>
<span sid='57521' title='57521'>He may be here any moment.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57522' title='57522'>'No. </span>
<span sid='57523' title='57523'>I'm sorry, but I have already overstayed my time. </span>
<span sid='57524' title='57524'>We shall expect you early to-morrow, and when you get that signal-book through the little door on the Duke of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=York&t=h'>York</a>'s steps you can put a triumphant Finis to your record in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>. </span>
<span sid='57525' title='57525'>What! </span>
<span sid='57526' title='57526'>Tokay!' </span>
<span sid='57527' title='57527'>He indicated a heavily sealed dust-covered bottle which stood with two high glasses upon a salver.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57528' title='57528'>'May I offer you a glass before your journey?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57529' title='57529'>'No, thanks. </span>
<span sid='57530' title='57530'>But it looks like revelry.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57531' title='57531'>'Altamont has a nice taste in wines, and he took a fancy to my Tokay. </span>
<span sid='57532' title='57532'>He is a touchy fellow, and needs humouring in small things. </span>
<span sid='57533' title='57533'>I have to study him, I assure you.' </span>
<span sid='57534' title='57534'>They had strolled out on to the terrace again, and along it to the further end where at a touch from the Baron's chauffeur the great car shivered and chuckled. </span>
<span sid='57535' title='57535'>'Those are the lights of Harwich, I suppose,' said the secretary, pulling on his dust coat. </span>
<span sid='57536' title='57536'>'How still and peaceful it all seems. </span>
<span sid='57537' title='57537'>There may be other lights within the week, and the English coast a less tranquil place! </span>
<span sid='57538' title='57538'>The heavens, too, may not be quite so peaceful if all that the good Zeppelin promises us comes true. </span>
<span sid='57539' title='57539'>By the way, who is that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57540' title='57540'>Only one window showed a light behind them; in it there stood a lamp, and beside it, seated at a table, was a dear old ruddy-faced woman in a country cap. </span>
<span sid='57541' title='57541'>She was bending over her knitting and stopping occasionally to stroke a large black cat upon a stool beside her.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57542' title='57542'>'That is Martha, the only servant I have left.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57543' title='57543'>The secretary chuckled.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57544' title='57544'>'She might almost personify Britannia,' said he, 'with her complete self-absorption and general air of comfortable somnolence. </span>
<span sid='57545' title='57545'>Well, au revoir, Von Bork!' - with a final wave of his hand he sprang into the car, and a moment later the two golden cones from the headlights shot forward through the darkness. </span>
<span sid='57546' title='57546'>The secretary lay back in the cushions of the luxurious limousine, with his thoughts so full of the impending <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>an tragedy that he hardly observed that as his car swung round the village street it nearly passed over a little Ford coming in the opposite direction.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57547' title='57547'>Von Bork walked slowly back to the study when the last gleams of the motor lamps had faded into the distance. </span>
<span sid='57548' title='57548'>As he passed he observed that his old housekeeper had put out her lamp and retired. </span>
<span sid='57549' title='57549'>It was a new experience to him, the silence and darkness of his widespread house, for his family and household had been a large one. </span>
<span sid='57550' title='57550'>It was a relief to him, however, to think that they were all in safety and that, but for that one old woman who had lingered in the kitchen, he had the whole place to himself. </span>
<span sid='57551' title='57551'>There was a good deal of tidying up to do inside his study and he set himself to do it, until his keen, handsome face was flushed with the heat of the burning papers. </span>
<span sid='57552' title='57552'>A leather valise stood beside his table, and into this he began to pack very neatly and systematically the precious contents of his safe. </span>
<span sid='57553' title='57553'>He had hardly got started with the work, however, when his quick ears caught the sound of a distant car. </span>
<span sid='57554' title='57554'>Instantly he gave an exclamation of satisfaction, strapped up the valise, shut the safe, locked it, and hurried out on to the terrace. </span>
<span sid='57555' title='57555'>He was just in time to see the lights of a small car come to a halt at the gate. </span>
<span sid='57556' title='57556'>A passenger sprang out and advanced swiftly towards him, while the chauffeur, a heavily built, elderly man, with a grey moustache, settled down, like one who resigns himself to a long vigil.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57557' title='57557'>'Well?' asked Von Bork eagerly, running forward to meet his visitor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57558' title='57558'>For answer the man waved a small brown-paper parcel triumphantly above his head.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57559' title='57559'>'You can give me the glad hand to-night, Mister,' he cried. </span>
<span sid='57560' title='57560'>'I'm bringing home the bacon at last.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57561' title='57561'>'The signals?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57562' title='57562'>'Same as I said in my cable. </span>
<span sid='57563' title='57563'>Every last one of them, semaphore, lamp code, Marconi - a copy, mind you, not the original. </span>
<span sid='57564' title='57564'>That was too dangerous. </span>
<span sid='57565' title='57565'>But it's the real goods, and you can lay to that.' </span>
<span sid='57566' title='57566'>He slapped the German upon the shoulder with a rough familiarity from which the other winced.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57567' title='57567'>'Come in,' he said. </span>
<span sid='57568' title='57568'>'I'm all alone in the house. </span>
<span sid='57569' title='57569'>I was only waiting for this. </span>
<span sid='57570' title='57570'>Of course a copy is better than the original. </span>
<span sid='57571' title='57571'>If an original were missing they would change the whole thing. </span>
<span sid='57572' title='57572'>You think it's all safe about the copy?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57573' title='57573'>The Irish-<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n had entered the study and stretched his long limbs from the arm-chair. </span>
<span sid='57574' title='57574'>He was a tall, gaunt man of sixty, with clear-cut features and a small goatee beard which gave him a general resemblance to the caricatures of Uncle Sam. </span>
<span sid='57575' title='57575'>A halfsmoked, sodden cigar hung from the corner of his mouth, and as he sat down he struck a match and relit it. </span>
<span sid='57576' title='57576'>'Making ready for a move?' he remarked as he looked round him. </span>
<span sid='57577' title='57577'>'Say, Mister,' he added, as his eyes fell upon the safe from which the curtain was now removed, 'you don't tell me you keep your papers in that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57578' title='57578'>'Why not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57579' title='57579'>'Gosh, in a wide-open contraption like that! </span>
<span sid='57580' title='57580'>And they reckon you to be some spy. </span>
<span sid='57581' title='57581'>Why a Yankee crook would be into that with a can-opener. </span>
<span sid='57582' title='57582'>If I'd known that any letter of mine was goin' to lie loose in a thing like that I'd have been a mug to write to you at all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57583' title='57583'>'It would puzzle any crook to force that safe,' Von Bork answered. </span>
<span sid='57584' title='57584'>'You won't cut that metal with any tool.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57585' title='57585'>'But the lock?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57586' title='57586'>'No, it's a double combination lock. </span>
<span sid='57587' title='57587'>You know what that is?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57588' title='57588'>'Search me,' said the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57589' title='57589'>'Well, you need a word as well as a set of figures before you can get the lock to work.' </span>
<span sid='57590' title='57590'>He rose and showed a double-radiating disc round the keyhole. </span>
<span sid='57591' title='57591'>'This outer one is for the letters, the inner one for the figures.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57592' title='57592'>'Well, well, that's fine.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57593' title='57593'>'So it's not quite as simple as you thought. </span>
<span sid='57594' title='57594'>It was four years ago that I had it made, and what do you think I chose for the word and figures?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57595' title='57595'>'It's beyond me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57596' title='57596'>'Well, I chose August for the word, and 1914 for the figures, and here we are.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57597' title='57597'>The <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n's face showed his surprise and admiration.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57598' title='57598'>'My, but that was smart! </span>
<span sid='57599' title='57599'>You had it down to a fine thing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57600' title='57600'>'Yes, a few of us even then-could have guessed the date. </span>
<span sid='57601' title='57601'>Here it is, and I'm shutting down to-morrow morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57602' title='57602'>'Well, I guess you'll have to fix me up also. </span>
<span sid='57603' title='57603'>I'm not staying in this goldarned country all on my lonesome. </span>
<span sid='57604' title='57604'>In a week or less from what I see, John Bull will be on his hind legs and fair ramping. </span>
<span sid='57605' title='57605'>I'd rather watch him from over the water.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57606' title='57606'>'But you're an <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n citizen?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57607' title='57607'>'Well, so was Jack James an <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n citizen, but he's doing time in Portland all the same. </span>
<span sid='57608' title='57608'>It cuts no ice with a British copper to tell him you're an <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n citizen. </span>
<span sid='57609' title='57609'>"It's British law and order over here," says he. </span>
<span sid='57610' title='57610'>By the way, Mister, talking of Jack James, it seems to me you don't do much to cover your men.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57611' title='57611'>'What do you mean?' Von Bork asked sharply.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57612' title='57612'>'Well, you are their employer, ain't you? </span>
<span sid='57613' title='57613'>It's up to you to see that they don't fall down. </span>
<span sid='57614' title='57614'>But they do fall down, and when did you ever pick them up? </span>
<span sid='57615' title='57615'>There's James-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57616' title='57616'>'It was James's own fault. </span>
<span sid='57617' title='57617'>You know that yourself. </span>
<span sid='57618' title='57618'>He was too self-willed for the job.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57619' title='57619'>'James was a bonehead - I give you that. </span>
<span sid='57620' title='57620'>Then there was Hollis.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57621' title='57621'>'The man was mad.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57622' title='57622'>'Well, he went a bit woozy towards the end. </span>
<span sid='57623' title='57623'>It's enough to make a man bughouse when he has to play a part from morning to night with a hundred guys all ready to set the coppers wise to him. </span>
<span sid='57624' title='57624'>But now there is Steiner-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57625' title='57625'>Von Bork started violently, and his ruddy face turned a shade paler.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57626' title='57626'>'What about Steiner?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57627' title='57627'>'Well, they've got him, that's all. </span>
<span sid='57628' title='57628'>They raided his store last night, and he and his papers are all in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Portsmouth&t=h'>Portsmouth</a> gaol. </span>
<span sid='57629' title='57629'>You'll go off and he, poor devil, will have to stand the racket, and lucky if he gets off with his life. </span>
<span sid='57630' title='57630'>That's why I want to get over the water as soon as you do.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57631' title='57631'>Von Bork was a strong, self-contained man, but it was easy to see that the news had shaken him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57632' title='57632'>'How could they have got on to Steiner?' he muttered. </span>
<span sid='57633' title='57633'>'That's the worst blow yet.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57634' title='57634'>'Well, you nearly had a worse one, for I believe they are not far off me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57635' title='57635'>'You don't mean that!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57636' title='57636'>'Sure thing. </span>
<span sid='57637' title='57637'>My landlady down Fratton way had some inquiries, and when I heard of it I guessed it was time for me to hustle. </span>
<span sid='57638' title='57638'>But what I want to know, Mister, is how the coppers know these things? </span>
<span sid='57639' title='57639'>Steiner is the fifth man you've lost since I signed on with you, and I know the name of the sixth if I don't get a move on. </span>
<span sid='57640' title='57640'>How do you explain it, and ain't you ashamed to see your men go down like this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57641' title='57641'>Von Bork flushed crimson.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57642' title='57642'>'How dare you speak in such a way!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57643' title='57643'>'If I didn't dare things, Mister, I wouldn't be in your service. </span>
<span sid='57644' title='57644'>But I'll tell you straight what is in my mind. </span>
<span sid='57645' title='57645'>I've heard that with you German politicians when an agent has done his work you are not sorry to see him put away.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57646' title='57646'>Von Bork sprang to his feet.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57647' title='57647'>'Do you dare to suggest that I have given away my own agents!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57648' title='57648'>'I don't stand for that, Mister, but there's a stool pigeon or a cross somewhere, and it's up to you to find out where it is. </span>
<span sid='57649' title='57649'>Anyhow I am taking no more chances. </span>
<span sid='57650' title='57650'>It's me for little <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Holland&t=h'>Holland</a>, and the sooner the better.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57651' title='57651'>Von Bork had mastered his anger.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57652' title='57652'>'We have been allies too long to quarrel now at the very hour of victory,' he said. </span>
<span sid='57653' title='57653'>'You've done splendid work and taken risks and I can't forget it. </span>
<span sid='57654' title='57654'>By all means go to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Holland&t=h'>Holland</a>, and you can get a boat from Rotterdam to New <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=York&t=h'>York</a>. </span>
<span sid='57655' title='57655'>No other line will be safe a week from now. </span>
<span sid='57656' title='57656'>I'll take that book and pack it with the rest.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57657' title='57657'>The <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n held the small parcel in his hand, but made no motion to give it up.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57658' title='57658'>'What about the dough?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57659' title='57659'>'The what?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57660' title='57660'>'The boodle. </span>
<span sid='57661' title='57661'>The reward. </span>
<span sid='57662' title='57662'>The £500. </span>
<span sid='57663' title='57663'>The gunner turned damned nasty at the last, and I had to square him with an extra hundred dollars or it would have been nitsky for you and me. </span>
<span sid='57664' title='57664'>"Nothin' doin'!" says he, and he meant it too, but the last hundred did it. </span>
<span sid='57665' title='57665'>It's cost me two hundred pound from first to last, so it isn't likely I'd give it up without gettin' my wad.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57666' title='57666'>Von Bork smiled with some bitterness. </span>
<span sid='57667' title='57667'>'You don't seem to have a very high opinion of my honour,' said he, 'you want the money before you give up the book.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57668' title='57668'>'Well, Mister, it is a business proposition.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57669' title='57669'>'All right. </span>
<span sid='57670' title='57670'>Have your way.' </span>
<span sid='57671' title='57671'>He sat down at the table and scribbled a cheque, which he tore from the book, but he refrained from handing it to his companion. </span>
<span sid='57672' title='57672'>'After all, since we are to be on such terms, Mr. Altamont,' said he, 'I don't see why I should trust you any more than you trust me. </span>
<span sid='57673' title='57673'>Do you understand?' he added, looking back over his shoulder at the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n. </span>
<span sid='57674' title='57674'>'There's the cheque upon the table. </span>
<span sid='57675' title='57675'>I claim the right to examine that parcel before you pick the money up.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57676' title='57676'>The <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n passed it over without a word. </span>
<span sid='57677' title='57677'>Von Bork undid a winding of string and two wrappers of paper. </span>
<span sid='57678' title='57678'>Then he sat gazing for a moment in silent amazement at a small blue book which lay before him. </span>
<span sid='57679' title='57679'>Across the cover was printed in golden letters Practical Handbook of Bee Culture. </span>
<span sid='57680' title='57680'>Only for one instant did the master spy glare at this strangely irrelevant inscription. </span>
<span sid='57681' title='57681'>The next he was gripped at the back of his neck by a grasp of iron, and a chloroformed sponge was held in front of his writhing face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57682' title='57682'>'Another glass, Watson!' said Mr. Sherlock Holmes, as he extended the bottle of Imperial Tokay.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57683' title='57683'>The thick-set chauffeur, who had seated himself by the table, pushed forward his glass with some eagerness.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57684' title='57684'>'It is a good wine, Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57685' title='57685'>'A remarkable wine, Watson. </span>
<span sid='57686' title='57686'>Our friend upon the sofa has assured me that it is from Franz Joseph's special cellar at the Schoenbrunn Palace. </span>
<span sid='57687' title='57687'>Might I trouble you to open the window, for chloroform vapour does not help the palate.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57688' title='57688'>The safe was ajar, and Holmes standing in front of it was removing dossier after dossier, swiftly examining each, and then packing it neatly in Von Bork's valise. </span>
<span sid='57689' title='57689'>The German lay upon the sofa sleeping stertorously with a strap round his upper arms and another round his legs.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57690' title='57690'>'We need not hurry ourselves, Watson. </span>
<span sid='57691' title='57691'>We are safe from interruption. </span>
<span sid='57692' title='57692'>Would you mind touching the bell. </span>
<span sid='57693' title='57693'>There is no one in the house except old Martha, who has played her part to admiration. </span>
<span sid='57694' title='57694'>I got her the situation here when first I took the matter up. </span>
<span sid='57695' title='57695'>Ah, Martha, you will be glad to hear that all is well.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57696' title='57696'>The pleasant old lady had appeared in the doorway. </span>
<span sid='57697' title='57697'>She curtseyed with a smile to Mr. Holmes, but glanced with some apprehension at the figure upon the sofa.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57698' title='57698'>'It is all right, Martha. </span>
<span sid='57699' title='57699'>He has not been hurt at all. </span>
<span sid='57700' title='57700'>'I am glad of that, Mr. Holmes. </span>
<span sid='57701' title='57701'>According to his lights he has been a kind master. </span>
<span sid='57702' title='57702'>He wanted me to go with his wife to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Germany&t=h'>Germany</a> yesterday, but that would hardly have suited your plans, would it, sir?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57703' title='57703'>'No, indeed, Martha. </span>
<span sid='57704' title='57704'>So long as you were here I was easy in my mind. </span>
<span sid='57705' title='57705'>We waited some time for your signal to-night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57706' title='57706'>'It was the secretary, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57707' title='57707'>'I know. </span>
<span sid='57708' title='57708'>His car passed ours.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57709' title='57709'>'I thought he would never go. </span>
<span sid='57710' title='57710'>I knew that it would not suit your plans, sir, to find him here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57711' title='57711'>'No, indeed. </span>
<span sid='57712' title='57712'>Well, it only meant that we waited half an hour or so until I saw your lamp go out and knew that the coast was clear. </span>
<span sid='57713' title='57713'>You can report to me to-morrow in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, Martha, at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Claridge's Hotel&t=h'>Claridge's Hotel</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57714' title='57714'>'Very good, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57715' title='57715'>'I suppose you have everything ready to leave.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57716' title='57716'>'Yes, sir. </span>
<span sid='57717' title='57717'>He posted seven letters to-day. </span>
<span sid='57718' title='57718'>I have the addresses as usual.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57719' title='57719'>'Very good, Martha. </span>
<span sid='57720' title='57720'>I will look into them tomorrow. </span>
<span sid='57721' title='57721'>Good night. </span>
<span sid='57722' title='57722'>These papers,' he continued, as the old lady vanished, 'are not of very great importance, for, of course, the information which they represent has been sent off long ago to the German Government. </span>
<span sid='57723' title='57723'>These are the originals which could not safely be got out of the country.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57724' title='57724'>'Then they are of no use.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57725' title='57725'>'I should not go so far as to say that, Watson. </span>
<span sid='57726' title='57726'>They will at least show our people what is known and what is not. </span>
<span sid='57727' title='57727'>I may say that a good many of these papers have come through me, and I need not add are thoroughly untrustworthy. </span>
<span sid='57728' title='57728'>It would brighten my declining years to see a German cruiser navigating the Solent according to the minefield plans which I have furnished. </span>
<span sid='57729' title='57729'>But you, Watson,' he stopped his work and took his old friend by the shoulders; 'I've hardly seen you in the light yet. </span>
<span sid='57730' title='57730'>How have the years used you? </span>
<span sid='57731' title='57731'>You look the same blithe boy as ever.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57732' title='57732'>'I feel twenty years younger, Holmes. </span>
<span sid='57733' title='57733'>I have seldom felt so happy as when I got your wire asking me to meet you at Harwich with the car. </span>
<span sid='57734' title='57734'>But you, Holmes - you have changed very little - save for that horrible goatee.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57735' title='57735'>'These are the sacrifices one makes for one's country, Watson,' said Holmes, pulling at his little tuft. </span>
<span sid='57736' title='57736'>'To-morrow it will be but a dreadful memory. </span>
<span sid='57737' title='57737'>With my hair cut and a few other superficial changes I shall no doubt reappear at Claridge's to-morrow as I was before this <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n stunt - I beg your pardon, Watson, my well of English seems to be permanently defiled - before this <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n job came my way.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57738' title='57738'>'But you had retired, Holmes. </span>
<span sid='57739' title='57739'>We heard of you as living the life of a hermit among your bees and your books in a small farm upon the South Downs.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57740' title='57740'>'Exactly, Watson. </span>
<span sid='57741' title='57741'>Here is the fruit of my leisured ease, the magnum opus of my latter years!' </span>
<span sid='57742' title='57742'>He picked up the volume from the table and read out the whole title, Practical Handbook of Bee Culture, with some Observations upon the Segregation of the Queen. </span>
<span sid='57743' title='57743'>Alone I did it. </span>
<span sid='57744' title='57744'>Behold the fruit of pensive nights and laborious days, when I watched the little working gangs as once I watched the criminal world of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57745' title='57745'>'But how did you get to work again?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57746' title='57746'>'Ah, I have often marvelled at it myself. </span>
<span sid='57747' title='57747'>The Foreign Minister alone I could have withstood, but when the Premier also deigned to visit my humble roof-! </span>
<span sid='57748' title='57748'>The fact is, Watson, that this gentleman upon the sofa was a bit too good for our people. </span>
<span sid='57749' title='57749'>He was in a class by himself. </span>
<span sid='57750' title='57750'>Things were going wrong, and no one could understand why they were going wrong. </span>
<span sid='57751' title='57751'>Agents were suspected or even caught, but there was evidence of some strong and secret central force. </span>
<span sid='57752' title='57752'>It was absolutely necessary to expose it. </span>
<span sid='57753' title='57753'>Strong pressure was brought upon me to look into the matter. </span>
<span sid='57754' title='57754'>It has cost me two years, Watson, but they have not been devoid of excitement. </span>
<span sid='57755' title='57755'>When I say that I started my pilgrimage at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>, graduated in an Irish secret society at Buffalo, gave serious trouble to the constabulary at Skibbareen and so eventually caught the eye of a subordinate agent of Von Bork, who recommended me as a likely man, you will realize that the matter was complex. </span>
<span sid='57756' title='57756'>Since then I have been honoured by his confidence, which has not prevented most of his plans going subtly wrong and five of his best agents being in prison. </span>
<span sid='57757' title='57757'>I watched them, Watson, and I picked them as they ripened. </span>
<span sid='57758' title='57758'>Well, sir, I hope that you are none the worse!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57759' title='57759'>The last remark was addressed to Von Bork himself, who after much gasping and blinking had lain quietly listening to Holmes's statement. </span>
<span sid='57760' title='57760'>He broke out now into a furious stream of German invective, his face convulsed with passion. </span>
<span sid='57761' title='57761'>Holmes continued his swift investigation of documents while his prisoner cursed and swore.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57762' title='57762'>'Though unmusical, German is the most expressive of all languages,' he observed, when Von Bork had stopped from pure exhaustion. </span>
<span sid='57763' title='57763'>'Hullo! </span>
<span sid='57764' title='57764'>Hullo!' he added, as he looked hard at the corner of a tracing before putting it in the box. </span>
<span sid='57765' title='57765'>'This should put another bird in the cage. </span>
<span sid='57766' title='57766'>I had no idea that the paymaster was such a rascal, though I have long had an eye upon him. </span>
<span sid='57767' title='57767'>Mister Von Bork, you have a great deal to answer for.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57768' title='57768'>The prisoner had raised himself with some difficulty upon the sofa and was staring with a strange mixture of amazement and hatred at his captor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57769' title='57769'>'I shall get level with you, Altamont,' he said, speaking with slow deliberation, 'if it takes me all my life I shall get level with you!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57770' title='57770'>'The old sweet song,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='57771' title='57771'>'How often have I heard it in days gone by. </span>
<span sid='57772' title='57772'>It was a favourite ditty of the late lamented Professor Moriarty. </span>
<span sid='57773' title='57773'>Colonel Sebastian Moran has also been known to warble it. </span>
<span sid='57774' title='57774'>And yet I live and keep bees upon the South Downs.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57775' title='57775'>'Curse you, you double traitor!' cried the German, straining against his bonds and glaring murder from his furious eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57776' title='57776'>'No, no, it is not so bad as that,' said Holmes, smiling. </span>
<span sid='57777' title='57777'>'As my speech surely shows you, Mr. Altamont of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a> had no existence in fact. </span>
<span sid='57778' title='57778'>I used him and he is gone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57779' title='57779'>'Then who are you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57780' title='57780'>'It is really immaterial who I am, but since the matter seems to interest you, Mr. Von Bork, I may say that this is not my first acquaintance with the members of your family. </span>
<span sid='57781' title='57781'>I have done a good deal of business in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Germany&t=h'>Germany</a> in the past, and my name is probably familiar to you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57782' title='57782'>'I would wish to know it,' said the Prussian grimly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57783' title='57783'>'It was I who brought about the separation between Irene Adler and the late King of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bohemia&t=h'>Bohemia</a> when your cousin Heinrich was the Imperial Envoy. </span>
<span sid='57784' title='57784'>It was I also who saved from murder, by the Nihilist Klopman, Count Von und Zu Grafenstein, who was your mother's elder brother. </span>
<span sid='57785' title='57785'>It was I-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57786' title='57786'>Von Bork sat up in amazement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57787' title='57787'>'There is only one man,' he cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57788' title='57788'>'Exactly,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57789' title='57789'>Von Bork groaned and sank back on the sofa. </span>
<span sid='57790' title='57790'>'And most of that information came through you,' he cried. </span>
<span sid='57791' title='57791'>'What is it worth? </span>
<span sid='57792' title='57792'>What have I done? </span>
<span sid='57793' title='57793'>It is my ruin for ever!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57794' title='57794'>'It is certainly a little untrustworthy,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='57795' title='57795'>'It will require some checking, and you have little time to check it. </span>
<span sid='57796' title='57796'>Your admiral may find the new guns rather larger than he expects, and the cruisers perhaps a trifle faster.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57797' title='57797'>Von Bork clutched at his own throat in despair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57798' title='57798'>'There are a good many other points of detail which will, no doubt, come to light in good time. </span>
<span sid='57799' title='57799'>But you have one quality which is very rare in a German, Mr. Von Bork, you are a sportsman and you will bear me no ill-will when you realize that you, who have outwitted so many other people, have at last been outwitted yourself. </span>
<span sid='57800' title='57800'>After all, you have done your best for your country, and I have done my best for mine, and what could be more natural? </span>
<span sid='57801' title='57801'>Besides,' he added, not unkindly, as he laid his hand upon the shoulder of the prostrate man, 'it is better than to fall before some more ignoble foe. </span>
<span sid='57802' title='57802'>These papers are now ready, Watson. </span>
<span sid='57803' title='57803'>If you will help me with our prisoner, I think that we may get started for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> at once.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57804' title='57804'>It was no easy task to move Von Bork, for he was a strong and a desperate man. </span>
<span sid='57805' title='57805'>Finally, holding either arm, the two friends walked him very slowly down the garden walk which he had trod with such proud confidence when he received the congratulations of the famous diplomatist only a few hours before. </span>
<span sid='57806' title='57806'>After a short, final struggle he was hoisted, still bound hand and foot, into the spare seat of the little car. </span>
<span sid='57807' title='57807'>His precious valise was wedged in beside him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57808' title='57808'>'I trust that you are as comfortable as circumstances permit,' said Holmes, when the final arrangements were made. </span>
<span sid='57809' title='57809'>'Should I be guilty of a liberty if I lit a cigar and placed it between your lips?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57810' title='57810'>But all amenities were wasted upon the angry German.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57811' title='57811'>'I suppose you realize, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,' said he, 'that if your Government bears you out in this treatment it becomes an act of war.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57812' title='57812'>'What about your Government and all this treatment?' said Holmes, tapping the valise.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57813' title='57813'>'You are a private individual. </span>
<span sid='57814' title='57814'>You have no warrant for my arrest. </span>
<span sid='57815' title='57815'>The whole proceeding is absolutely illegal and outrageous.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57816' title='57816'>'Absolutely,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57817' title='57817'>'Kidnapping a German subject.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57818' title='57818'>'And stealing his private papers.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57819' title='57819'>'Well, you realize your position, you and your accomplice here. </span>
<span sid='57820' title='57820'>If I were to shout for help as we pass through the village-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57821' title='57821'>'My dear sir, if you did anything so foolish you would probably enlarge the too limited titles of our village inns by giving us "The Dangling Prussian" as a sign-post. </span>
<span sid='57822' title='57822'>The Englishman is a patient creature, but at present his temper is a little inflamed and it would be as well not to try him too far. </span>
<span sid='57823' title='57823'>No, Mr. Von Bork, you will go with us in a quiet, sensible fashion to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>, whence you can send for your friend Baron Von Herling and see if even now you may not fill that place which he has reserved for you in the ambassadorial suite. </span>
<span sid='57824' title='57824'>As to you, Watson, you are joining up with your old service, as I understand, so <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> won't be out of your way. </span>
<span sid='57825' title='57825'>Stand with me here upon the terrace, for it may be the last quiet talk that we shall ever have.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57826' title='57826'>The two friends chatted in intimate converse for a few minutes, recalling once again the days of the past whilst their prisoner vainly wriggled to undo the bonds that held him. </span>
<span sid='57827' title='57827'>As they turned to the car, Holmes pointed back to the moonlit sea, and shook a thoughtful head.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57828' title='57828'>'There's an east wind coming, Watson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57829' title='57829'>'I think not, Holmes. </span>
<span sid='57830' title='57830'>It is very warm.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57831' title='57831'>'Good old Watson! </span>
<span sid='57832' title='57832'>You are the one fixed point in a changing age. </span>
<span sid='57833' title='57833'>There's an east wind coming all the same, such a wind as never blew on <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> yet. </span>
<span sid='57834' title='57834'>It will be cold and bitter, Watson, and a good many of us may wither before its blast. </span>
<span sid='57835' title='57835'>But it's God's own wind none the less, and a cleaner, better, stronger land will lie in the sunshine when the storm has cleared. </span>
<span sid='57836' title='57836'>Start her up, Watson, for it's time that we were on our way. </span>
<span sid='57837' title='57837'>I have a cheque for five hundred pounds which should be cashed early, for the drawer is quite capable of stopping it, if he can.'</span>
