<p class="subtitle">Arthur Conan Doyle<label for="sn-meta-gree" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-meta-gree" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><!--googleoff: all--><b>Story Number</b>: 24<br><b>Published in</b>: The Strand Magazine in September 1893<br><b>Collected in</b>: The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes<!--googleon: all--></span></p>
<p>
<span sid='14024' title='14024'>During my long and intimate acquaintance with Mr. Sherlock Holmes I had never heard him refer to his relations, and hardly ever to his own early life. </span>
<span sid='14025' title='14025'>This reticence upon his part had increased the somewhat inhuman effect which he produced upon me, until sometimes I found myself regarding him as an isolated phenomenon, a brain without a heart, as deficient in human sympathy as he was pre-eminent in intelligence. </span>
<span sid='14026' title='14026'>His aversion to women, and his disinclination to form new friendships, were both typical of his unemotional character, but not more so than his complete suppression of every reference to his own people. </span>
<span sid='14027' title='14027'>I had come to believe that he was an orphan with no relatives living, but one day, to my very great surprise, he began to talk to me about his brother.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14028' title='14028'>It was after tea on a summer evening, and the conversation, which had roamed in a desultory, spasmodic fashion from golf clubs to the causes of the change in the obliquity of the ecliptic, came round at last to the question of atavism and hereditary aptitudes. </span>
<span sid='14029' title='14029'>The point under discussion was how far any singular gift in an individual was due to his ancestry, and how far to his own early training.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14030' title='14030'>'In your own case,' said I, 'from all that you have told me it seems obvious that your faculty of observation and your peculiar facility for deduction are due to your own systematic training.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14031' title='14031'>'To some extent,' he answered, thoughtfully. </span>
<span sid='14032' title='14032'>'My ancestors were country squires, who appear to have led much the same life as is natural to their class. </span>
<span sid='14033' title='14033'>But, none the less, my turn that way is in my veins, and may have come with my grandmother, who was the sister of Vernet, the French artist. </span>
<span sid='14034' title='14034'>Art in the blood is liable to take the strangest forms.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14035' title='14035'>'But how do you know that it is hereditary?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14036' title='14036'>'Because my brother Mycroft possesses it in a larger degree than I do.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14037' title='14037'>This was news to me, indeed. </span>
<span sid='14038' title='14038'>If there were another man with such singular powers in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, how was it that neither police nor public had heard of him? </span>
<span sid='14039' title='14039'>I put the question, with a hint that it was my companion's modesty which made him acknowledge his brother as his superior. </span>
<span sid='14040' title='14040'>Holmes laughed at my suggestion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14041' title='14041'>'My dear Watson,' said he. </span>
<span sid='14042' title='14042'>'I cannot agree with those who rank modesty among the virtues. </span>
<span sid='14043' title='14043'>To the logician all things should be seen exactly as they are, and to under-estimate oneself is as much a departure from truth as to exaggerate one's own powers. </span>
<span sid='14044' title='14044'>When I say, therefore, that Mycroft has better powers of observation than I, you may take it that I am speaking the exact and literal truth.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14045' title='14045'>'Is he your junior?</span>
<p>
<span sid='14046' title='14046'>'Seven years my senior.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14047' title='14047'>'How comes it that he is unknown?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14048' title='14048'>'Oh, he is very well known in his own circle.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14049' title='14049'>'Where, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14050' title='14050'>'Well, in the Diogenes Club, for example.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14051' title='14051'>I had never heard of the institution, and my face must have proclaimed as much, for Sherlock Holmes pulled out his watch.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14052' title='14052'>'The Diogenes Club is the queerest club in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, and Mycroft one of the queerest men. </span>
<span sid='14053' title='14053'>He's always there from a quarter to five till twenty to eight. </span>
<span sid='14054' title='14054'>It's six now, so if you care for a stroll this beautiful evening I shall be very happy to introduce you to two curiosities.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14055' title='14055'>Five minutes later we were in the street, walking towards Regent Circus.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14056' title='14056'>'You wonder,' said my companion, 'why it is that Mycroft does not use his powers for detective work. </span>
<span sid='14057' title='14057'>He is incapable of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14058' title='14058'>'But I thought you said-!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14059' title='14059'>'I said that he was my superior in observation and deduction. </span>
<span sid='14060' title='14060'>If the art of the detective began and ended in reasoning from an arm-chair, my brother would be the greatest criminal agent that ever lived. </span>
<span sid='14061' title='14061'>But he has no ambition and no energy. </span>
<span sid='14062' title='14062'>He would not even go out of his way to verify his own solutions, and would rather be considered wrong than take the trouble to prove himself right. </span>
<span sid='14063' title='14063'>Again and again I have taken a problem to him and have received an explanation which has afterwards proved to be the correct one. </span>
<span sid='14064' title='14064'>And yet he was absolutely incapable of working out the practical points which must be gone into before a case could be laid before a judge or jury.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14065' title='14065'>'It is not his profession, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14066' title='14066'>'By no means. </span>
<span sid='14067' title='14067'>What is to me a means of livelihood is to him the merest hobby of a dilettante. </span>
<span sid='14068' title='14068'>He has an extraordinary faculty for figures, and audits the books in some of the Government departments. </span>
<span sid='14069' title='14069'>Mycroft lodges in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pall Mall&t=h'>Pall Mall</a>, and he walks round the corner into <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Whitehall&t=h'>Whitehall</a> every morning and back every evening. </span>
<span sid='14070' title='14070'>From year's end to year's end he takes no other exercise, and is seen nowhere else, except only in the Diogenes Club, which is just opposite his rooms.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14071' title='14071'>'I cannot recall the name.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14072' title='14072'>'Very likely not. </span>
<span sid='14073' title='14073'>There are many men in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, you know, who, some from shyness, some from misanthropy, have no wish for the company of their fellows. </span>
<span sid='14074' title='14074'>Yet they are not averse to comfortable chairs and the latest periodicals. </span>
<span sid='14075' title='14075'>It is for the convenience of these that the Diogenes Club was started, and it now contains the most unsociable and unclubbable men in town. </span>
<span sid='14076' title='14076'>No member is permitted to take the least notice of any other one. </span>
<span sid='14077' title='14077'>Save in the Strangers' Room, no talking is, under any circumstances, permitted, and three offences, if brought to the notice of the committee, render the talker liable to expulsion. </span>
<span sid='14078' title='14078'>My brother was one of the founders, and I have myself found it a very soothing atmosphere.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14079' title='14079'>We had reached <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pall Mall&t=h'>Pall Mall</a> as we talked, and were walking down it from the St. James's end. </span>
<span sid='14080' title='14080'>Sherlock Holmes stopped at a door some little distance from the Carlton, and, cautioning me not to speak, he led the way into the hall. </span>
<span sid='14081' title='14081'>Through the glass panelling I caught a glimpse of a large and luxurious room in which a considerable number of men were sitting about and reading papers, each in his own little nook. </span>
<span sid='14082' title='14082'>Holmes showed me into a small chamber which looked out on to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pall Mall&t=h'>Pall Mall</a>, and then, leaving me for a minute, he came back with a companion who I knew could only be his brother.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14083' title='14083'>Mycroft Holmes was a much larger and stouter man than Sherlock. </span>
<span sid='14084' title='14084'>His body was absolutely corpulent, but his face, though massive, had preserved something of the sharpness of expression which was so remarkable in that of his brother. </span>
<span sid='14085' title='14085'>His eyes, which were of a peculiarly light watery grey, seemed to always retain that far-away, introspective look which I had only observed in Sherlock's when he was exerting his full powers.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14086' title='14086'>'I am glad to meet you, sir,' said he, putting out a broad, flat hand, like the flipper of a seal. </span>
<span sid='14087' title='14087'>'I hear of Sherlock everywhere since you became his chronicler.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14088' title='14088'>By the way, Sherlock, I expected to see you round last week to consult me over that Manor House case. </span>
<span sid='14089' title='14089'>I thought you might be a little out of your depth.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14090' title='14090'>'No, I solved it,' said my friend, smiling.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14091' title='14091'>'It was Adams, of course?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14092' title='14092'>'Yes, it was Adams.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14093' title='14093'>'I was sure of it from the first.' </span>
<span sid='14094' title='14094'>The two sat down together in the bow-window of the club. </span>
<span sid='14095' title='14095'>'To anyone who wishes to study mankind this is the spot,' said Mycroft. </span>
<span sid='14096' title='14096'>'Look at the magnificent types! </span>
<span sid='14097' title='14097'>Look at these two men who are coming towards us, for example.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14098' title='14098'>'The billiard-marker and the other?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14099' title='14099'>'Precisely. </span>
<span sid='14100' title='14100'>What do you make of the other?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14101' title='14101'>The two men had stopped opposite the window. </span>
<span sid='14102' title='14102'>Some chalk marks over the waistcoat pocket were the only signs of billiards which I could see in one of them. </span>
<span sid='14103' title='14103'>The other was a very small, dark fellow, with his hat pushed back and several packages under his arm.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14104' title='14104'>'An old soldier, I perceive,' said Sherlock.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14105' title='14105'>'And very recently discharged,' remarked the brother.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14106' title='14106'>'Served in India, I see.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14107' title='14107'>'And a non-commissioned officer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14108' title='14108'>'Royal Artillery, I fancy,' said Sherlock.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14109' title='14109'>'And a widower.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14110' title='14110'>'But with a child.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14111' title='14111'>'Children, my dear boy, children.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14112' title='14112'>'Come,' said I, laughing, 'this is a little too much.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14113' title='14113'>'Surely,' answered Holmes, 'it is not hard to say that a man with that bearing, expression of authority, and sun-baked skin is a soldier, is more than a private, and is not long from India.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14114' title='14114'>'That he has not left the service long is shown by his still wearing his "ammunition boots," as they are called,' observed Mycroft.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14115' title='14115'>'He has not the cavalry stride, yet he wore his hat on one side, as is shown by the lighter skin on that side of his brow. </span>
<span sid='14116' title='14116'>His weight is against his being a sapper. </span>
<span sid='14117' title='14117'>He is in the artillery.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14118' title='14118'>'Then, of course, his complete mourning shows that he has lost someone very dear. </span>
<span sid='14119' title='14119'>The fact that he is doing his own shopping looks as though it were his wife. </span>
<span sid='14120' title='14120'>He has been buying things for children, you perceive. </span>
<span sid='14121' title='14121'>There is a rattle, which shows that one of them is very young. </span>
<span sid='14122' title='14122'>The wife probably died in child-bed. </span>
<span sid='14123' title='14123'>The fact that he has a picture-book under his arm shows that there is another child to be thought of.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14124' title='14124'>I began to understand what my friend meant when he said that his brother possessed even keener faculties than he did himself. </span>
<span sid='14125' title='14125'>He glanced across at me and smiled. </span>
<span sid='14126' title='14126'>Mycroft took snuff from a tortoiseshell box and brushed away the wandering grains from his coat with a large, red silk handkerchief.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14127' title='14127'>'By the way, Sherlock,' said he, 'I have had something quite after your own heart - a most singular problem - submitted to my judgment. </span>
<span sid='14128' title='14128'>I really had not the energy to follow it up, save in a very incomplete fashion, but it gave me a basis for some very pleasing speculations. </span>
<span sid='14129' title='14129'>If you would care to hear the facts-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14130' title='14130'>'My dear Mycroft, I should be delighted.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14131' title='14131'>The brother scribbled a note upon a leaf of his pocket-book, and, ringing the bell, he handed it to the waiter.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14132' title='14132'>'I have asked Mr. Melas to step across,' said he. </span>
<span sid='14133' title='14133'>'He lodges on the floor above me, and I have some slight acquaintance with him, which led him to come to me in his perplexity. </span>
<span sid='14134' title='14134'>Mr. Melas is a Greek by extraction, as I understand, and he is a remarkable linguist. </span>
<span sid='14135' title='14135'>He earns his living partly as interpreter in the law courts, partly by acting as guide to any wealthy Orientals who may visit the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Northumberland Avenue&t=h'>Northumberland Avenue</a> hotels. </span>
<span sid='14136' title='14136'>I think I will leave him to tell his own very remarkable experience in his own fashion.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14137' title='14137'>A few minutes later we were joined by a short, stout man, whose olive face and coal-black hair proclaimed his Southern origin, though his speech was that of an educated Englishman. </span>
<span sid='14138' title='14138'>He shook hands eagerly with Sherlock Holmes, and his dark eyes sparkled with pleasure when he understood that the specialist was anxious to hear his story.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14139' title='14139'>'I do not believe that the police credit me - on my word I do not,' said he, in a wailing voice. </span>
<span sid='14140' title='14140'>'Just because they have never heard of it before, they think that such a thing cannot be. </span>
<span sid='14141' title='14141'>But I know that I shall never be easy in my mind until I know what has become of my poor man with the sticking-plaster upon his face.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14142' title='14142'>'I am all attention,' said Sherlock Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14143' title='14143'>'This is Wednesday evening,' said Mr. Melas; 'well, then it was on Monday night - only two days ago, you understand - that all this happened. </span>
<span sid='14144' title='14144'>I am an interpreter, as, perhaps, my neighbour there has told you. </span>
<span sid='14145' title='14145'>I interpret all languages - or nearly all - but as I am a Greek by birth, and with a Grecian name, it is with that particular tongue that I am principally associated. </span>
<span sid='14146' title='14146'>For many years I have been the chief Greek interpreter in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, and my name is very well known in the hotels.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14147' title='14147'>'It happens, not unfrequently, that I am sent for at strange hours, by foreigners who get into difficulties, or by travellers who arrive late and wish my services. </span>
<span sid='14148' title='14148'>I was not surprised, therefore, on Monday night when a Mr. Latimer, a very fashionably dressed young man, came up to my rooms and asked me to accompany him in a cab, which was waiting at the door. </span>
<span sid='14149' title='14149'>A Greek friend had come to see him upon business, he said, and, as he could speak nothing but his own tongue, the services of an interpreter were indispensable. </span>
<span sid='14150' title='14150'>He gave me to understand that his house was some little distance off, in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kensington&t=h'>Kensington</a>, and he seemed to be in a great hurry, bustling me rapidly into the cab when we had descended into the street.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14151' title='14151'>'I say into the cab, but I soon became doubtful as to whether it was not a carriage in which I found myself. </span>
<span sid='14152' title='14152'>It was certainly more roomy than the ordinary four-wheeled disgrace to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, and the fittings, though frayed, were of rich quality. </span>
<span sid='14153' title='14153'>Mr. Latimer seated himself opposite to me, and we started off through <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Charing Cross&t=h'>Charing Cross</a> and up the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Shaftesbury Avenue&t=h'>Shaftesbury Avenue</a>. </span>
<span sid='14154' title='14154'>We had come out upon <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Oxford Street&t=h'>Oxford Street</a>, and I had ventured some remark as to this being a roundabout way to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kensington&t=h'>Kensington</a>, when my words were arrested by the extraordinary conduct of my companion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14155' title='14155'>'He began by drawing a most formidable-looking bludgeon loaded with lead from his pocket, and switched it backwards and forwards several times, as if to test its weight and strength. </span>
<span sid='14156' title='14156'>Then he placed it, without a word, upon the seat beside him. </span>
<span sid='14157' title='14157'>Having done this, he drew up the windows on each side, and I found to my astonishment that they were covered with paper so as to prevent my seeing through them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14158' title='14158'>'"I am sorry to cut off your view, Mr. Melas," said he. </span>
<span sid='14159' title='14159'>"The fact is that I have no intention that you should see what the place is to which we are driving. </span>
<span sid='14160' title='14160'>It might possibly be inconvenient to me if you could find your way here again."</span>
<p>
<span sid='14161' title='14161'>'As you can imagine, I was utterly taken aback by such an address. </span>
<span sid='14162' title='14162'>My companion was a powerful, broad-shouldered young fellow, and, apart from the weapon, I should not have had the slightest chance in a struggle with him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14163' title='14163'>'"This is very extraordinary conduct, Mr. Latimer," I stammered. </span>
<span sid='14164' title='14164'>"You must be aware that what you are doing is quite illegal."</span>
<p>
<span sid='14165' title='14165'>'"It is somewhat of a liberty, no doubt," said he, "but we'll make it up to you. </span>
<span sid='14166' title='14166'>But I must warn you, however, Mr. Melas, that if at any time to-night you attempt to raise an alarm or do anything which is against my interests, you will find it a very serious thing. </span>
<span sid='14167' title='14167'>I beg you to remember that no one knows where you are, and that whether you are in this carriage or in my house, you are equally in my power."</span>
<p>
<span sid='14168' title='14168'>'His words were quiet, but he had a rasping way of saying them which was very menacing. </span>
<span sid='14169' title='14169'>I sat in silence, wondering what on earth could be his reason for kidnapping me in this extraordinary fashion. </span>
<span sid='14170' title='14170'>Whatever it might be, it was perfectly clear that there was no possible use in my resisting, and that I could only wait to see what might befall.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14171' title='14171'>'For nearly two hours we drove without my having the least clue as to where we were going. </span>
<span sid='14172' title='14172'>Sometimes the rattle of the stones told of a paved causeway, and at others our smooth, silent course suggested asphalt, but save this variation in sound there was nothing at all which could in the remotest way help me to form a guess as to where we were. </span>
<span sid='14173' title='14173'>The paper over each window was impenetrable to light, and a blue curtain was drawn across the glass-work in front. </span>
<span sid='14174' title='14174'>It was a quarter past seven when we left <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pall Mall&t=h'>Pall Mall</a>, and my watch showed me that it was ten minutes to nine when we at last came to a standstill. </span>
<span sid='14175' title='14175'>My companion let down the window and I caught a glimpse of a low, arched doorway with a lamp burning above it. </span>
<span sid='14176' title='14176'>As I was hurried from the carriage it swung open, and I found myself inside the house, with a vague impression of a lawn and trees on each side of me as I entered. </span>
<span sid='14177' title='14177'>Whether these were private grounds, however, or bona-fide country was more than I could possibly venture to say.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14178' title='14178'>'There was a coloured gas-lamp inside, which was turned so low that I could see little save that the hall was of some size and hung with pictures. </span>
<span sid='14179' title='14179'>In the dim light I could make out that the person who had opened the door was a small, mean-looking, middle-aged man with rounded shoulders. </span>
<span sid='14180' title='14180'>As he turned towards us the glint of the light showed me that he was wearing glasses.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14181' title='14181'>'"Is this Mr. Melas, Harold?" said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14182' title='14182'>'"Yes."</span>
<p>
<span sid='14183' title='14183'>'"Well done! </span>
<span sid='14184' title='14184'>Well done! </span>
<span sid='14185' title='14185'>No ill-will, Mr. Melas, I hope, but we could not get on without you. </span>
<span sid='14186' title='14186'>If you deal fair with us you'll not regret it; but if you try any tricks, God help you!"</span>
<p>
<span sid='14187' title='14187'>'He spoke in a jerky, nervous fashion, and with some giggling laughs in between, but somehow he impressed me with fear more than the other.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14188' title='14188'>'"What do you want with me?" I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14189' title='14189'>'"Only to ask a few questions of a Greek gentleman who is visiting us, and to let us have the answers. </span>
<span sid='14190' title='14190'>But say no more than you are told to say, or" - here came the nervous giggle again - "you had better never have been born."</span>
<p>
<span sid='14191' title='14191'>'As he spoke he opened a door and showed the way into a room which appeared to be very richly furnished - but again the only light was afforded by a single lamp half turned down. </span>
<span sid='14192' title='14192'>The chamber was certainly large, and the way in which my feet sank into the carpet as I stepped across it told me of its richness. </span>
<span sid='14193' title='14193'>I caught glimpses of velvet chairs, a high, white marble mantelpiece, and what seemed to be a suit of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Japan&t=h'>Japan</a>ese armour at one side of it. </span>
<span sid='14194' title='14194'>There was a chair just under the lamp, and the elderly man motioned that I should sit in it. </span>
<span sid='14195' title='14195'>The younger had left us, but he suddenly returned through another door, leading with him a gentleman clad in some sort of loose dressing-gown, who moved slowly towards us. </span>
<span sid='14196' title='14196'>As he came into the circle of dim light which enabled me to see him more clearly, I was thrilled with horror at his appearance. </span>
<span sid='14197' title='14197'>He was deadly pale and terribly emaciated, with the protruding, brilliant eyes of a man whose spirit is greater than his strength. </span>
<span sid='14198' title='14198'>But what shocked me more than any signs of physical weakness was that his face was grotesquely criss-crossed with sticking-plaster, and that one large pad of it was fastened over his mouth.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14199' title='14199'>'"Have you the slate, Harold?" cried the older man, as this strange being fell rather than sat down into a chair. </span>
<span sid='14200' title='14200'>"Are his hands loose? </span>
<span sid='14201' title='14201'>Now then, give him the pencil. </span>
<span sid='14202' title='14202'>You are to ask the questions, Mr. Melas, and he will write the answers. </span>
<span sid='14203' title='14203'>Ask him first of all whether he is prepared to sign the papers."</span>
<p>
<span sid='14204' title='14204'>'The man's eyes flashed fire.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14205' title='14205'>'"Never," he wrote in Greek upon the slate.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14206' title='14206'>'"On no conditions?" I asked at the bidding of our tyrant.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14207' title='14207'>'"Only if I see her married in my presence by a Greek priest whom I know."</span>
<p>
<span sid='14208' title='14208'>'The man giggled in his venomous way.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14209' title='14209'>'"You know what awaits you, then?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='14210' title='14210'>'"I care nothing for myself."</span>
<p>
<span sid='14211' title='14211'>'These are samples of the questions and answers which made up our strange, half-spoken, half-written conversation. </span>
<span sid='14212' title='14212'>Again and again I had to ask him whether he would give in and sign the document. </span>
<span sid='14213' title='14213'>Again and again I had the same indignant reply. </span>
<span sid='14214' title='14214'>But soon a happy thought came to me. </span>
<span sid='14215' title='14215'>I took to adding on little sentences of my own to each question-innocent ones at first, to test whether either of our companions knew anything of the matter, and then, as I found that they showed no sign, I played a more dangerous game. </span>
<span sid='14216' title='14216'>Our conversation ran something like this:</span>
<p>
<span sid='14217' title='14217'>'"You can do no good by this obstinacy. </span>
<span sid='14218' title='14218'>Who are you?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='14219' title='14219'>'"I care not. </span>
<span sid='14220' title='14220'>I am a stranger in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>."</span>
<p>
<span sid='14221' title='14221'>'"Your fate will be on your own head. </span>
<span sid='14222' title='14222'>How long have you been here?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='14223' title='14223'>'"Let it be so. </span>
<span sid='14224' title='14224'>Three weeks."</span>
<p>
<span sid='14225' title='14225'>'"The property can never be yours. </span>
<span sid='14226' title='14226'>What ails you?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='14227' title='14227'>'"It shall not go to villains. </span>
<span sid='14228' title='14228'>They are starving me."</span>
<p>
<span sid='14229' title='14229'>'"You shall go free if you sign. </span>
<span sid='14230' title='14230'>What house is this?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='14231' title='14231'>'"I will never sign. </span>
<span sid='14232' title='14232'>I do not know."</span>
<p>
<span sid='14233' title='14233'>'"You are not doing her any service. </span>
<span sid='14234' title='14234'>What is your name?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='14235' title='14235'>'"Let me hear her say so. </span>
<span sid='14236' title='14236'>Kratides."</span>
<p>
<span sid='14237' title='14237'>'"You shall see her if you sign. </span>
<span sid='14238' title='14238'>Where are you from?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='14239' title='14239'>'"Then I shall never see her. </span>
<span sid='14240' title='14240'><a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Athens&t=h'>Athens</a>."</span>
<p>
<span sid='14241' title='14241'>'Another five minutes, Mr. Holmes, and I should have wormed out the whole story under their very noses. </span>
<span sid='14242' title='14242'>My very next question might have cleared the matter up, but at that instant the door opened and a woman stepped into the room. </span>
<span sid='14243' title='14243'>I could not see her clearly enough to know more than that she was tall and graceful, with black hair, and clad in some sort of loose white gown.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14244' title='14244'>'"Harold!" said she, speaking English with a broken accent, "I could not stay away longer. </span>
<span sid='14245' title='14245'>It is so lonely up there with only - oh, my God, it is Paul!"</span>
<p>
<span sid='14246' title='14246'>'These last words were in Greek, and at the same instant the man, with a convulsive effort, tore the plaster from his lips, and screaming out "Sophy! </span>
<span sid='14247' title='14247'>Sophy!" rushed into the woman's arms. </span>
<span sid='14248' title='14248'>Their embrace was but for an instant, however, for the younger man seized the woman and pushed her out of the room, while the elder easily overpowered his emaciated victim, and dragged him away through the other door. </span>
<span sid='14249' title='14249'>For a moment I was left alone in the room, and I sprang to my feet with some vague idea that I might in some way get a clue to what this house was in which I found myself. </span>
<span sid='14250' title='14250'>Fortunately, however, I took no steps, for, looking up, I saw that the older man was standing in the doorway, with his eyes fixed upon me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14251' title='14251'>'"That will do, Mr. Melas," said he. </span>
<span sid='14252' title='14252'>"You perceive that we have taken you into our confidence over some very private business. </span>
<span sid='14253' title='14253'>We should not have troubled you only that our friend who speaks Greek and who began these negotiations has been forced to return to the East. </span>
<span sid='14254' title='14254'>It was quite necessary for us to find someone to take his place, and we were fortunate in hearing of your powers."</span>
<p>
<span sid='14255' title='14255'>'I bowed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14256' title='14256'>'"There are five sovereigns here," said he, walking up to me, "which will, I hope, be a sufficient fee. </span>
<span sid='14257' title='14257'>But remember," he added, tapping me lightly on the chest and giggling, "if you speak to a human soul about this - one human soul, mind - well, may God have mercy upon your soul!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14258' title='14258'>'I cannot tell you the loathing and horror with which this insignificant-looking man inspired me. </span>
<span sid='14259' title='14259'>I could see him better now as the lamp-light shone upon him. </span>
<span sid='14260' title='14260'>His features were peeky and sallow, and his little, pointed beard was thready and ill-nourished. </span>
<span sid='14261' title='14261'>He pushed his face forward as he spoke, and his lips and eyelids were continually twitching, like a man with St. Vitus's dance. </span>
<span sid='14262' title='14262'>I could not help thinking that his strange, catchy little laugh was also a symptom of some nervous malady. </span>
<span sid='14263' title='14263'>The terror of his face lay in his eyes, however, steel grey, and glistening coldly, with a malignant, inexorable cruelty in their depths.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14264' title='14264'>'"We shall know if you speak of this," said he. </span>
<span sid='14265' title='14265'>"We have our own means of information. </span>
<span sid='14266' title='14266'>Now, you will find the carriage waiting, and my friend will see you on your way."</span>
<p>
<span sid='14267' title='14267'>'I was hurried through the hall, and into the vehicle, again obtaining that momentary glimpse of trees and a garden. </span>
<span sid='14268' title='14268'>Mr. Latimer followed closely at my heels, and took his place opposite to me without a word. </span>
<span sid='14269' title='14269'>In silence we again drove for an interminable distance, with the windows raised, until at last, just after midnight, the carriage pulled up.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14270' title='14270'>'"You will get down here, Mr. Melas," said my companion. </span>
<span sid='14271' title='14271'>"I am sorry to leave you so far from your house, but there is no alternative. </span>
<span sid='14272' title='14272'>Any attempt upon your part to follow the carriage can only end in injury to yourself."</span>
<p>
<span sid='14273' title='14273'>'He opened the door as he spoke, and I had hardly time to spring out when the coachman lashed the horse, and the carriage rattled away. </span>
<span sid='14274' title='14274'>I looked round me in astonishment. </span>
<span sid='14275' title='14275'>I was on some sort of a heathy common, mottled over with dark clumps of furze bushes. </span>
<span sid='14276' title='14276'>Far away stretched a line of houses, with a light here and there in the upper windows. </span>
<span sid='14277' title='14277'>On the other side I saw the red signal lamps of a railway.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14278' title='14278'>'The carriage which had brought me was already out of sight. </span>
<span sid='14279' title='14279'>I stood gazing round and wondering where on earth I might be, when I saw someone coming towards me in the darkness. </span>
<span sid='14280' title='14280'>As he came up to me I made out that it was a railway porter.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14281' title='14281'>'"Can you tell me what place this is?" I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14282' title='14282'>'"<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Wandsworth Common&t=h'>Wandsworth Common</a>," said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14283' title='14283'>'"Can I get a train into town?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='14284' title='14284'>'"If you walk on a mile or so, to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Clapham Junction&t=h'>Clapham Junction</a>," said he, "you'll just be in time for the last to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Victoria&t=h'>Victoria</a>."</span>
<p>
<span sid='14285' title='14285'>'So that was the end of my adventure, Mr. Holmes. </span>
<span sid='14286' title='14286'>I do not know where I was nor whom I spoke with, nor anything, save what I have told you. </span>
<span sid='14287' title='14287'>But I know that there is foul play going on, and I want to help that unhappy man if I can. </span>
<span sid='14288' title='14288'>I told the whole story to Mr. Mycroft Holmes next morning, and, subsequently, to the police.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14289' title='14289'>We all sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative. </span>
<span sid='14290' title='14290'>Then Sherlock looked across at his brother.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14291' title='14291'>'Any steps?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14292' title='14292'>Mycroft picked up the Daily News, which was lying on a side-table.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14293' title='14293'>'"Anybody supplying any information as to the whereabouts of a Greek gentleman named Paul Kratides, from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Athens&t=h'>Athens</a>, who is unable to speak English, will be rewarded. </span>
<span sid='14294' title='14294'>A similar reward paid to anyone giving information about a Greek lady whose first name is Sophy. </span>
<span sid='14295' title='14295'>X2473." </span>
<span sid='14296' title='14296'>That was in all the dailies. </span>
<span sid='14297' title='14297'>No answer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14298' title='14298'>'How about the Greek Legation?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14299' title='14299'>'I have inquired. </span>
<span sid='14300' title='14300'>They know nothing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14301' title='14301'>'A wire to the head of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Athens&t=h'>Athens</a> police, then.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14302' title='14302'>'Sherlock has all the energy of the family,' said Mycroft, turning to me. </span>
<span sid='14303' title='14303'>'Well, you take up the case by all means, and let me know if you do any good.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14304' title='14304'>'Certainly,' answered my friend, rising from his chair. </span>
<span sid='14305' title='14305'>'I'll let you know, and Mr. Melas also. </span>
<span sid='14306' title='14306'>In the meantime, Mr. Melas, I should certainly be on my guard if I were you, for, of course, they must know through these advertisements that you have betrayed them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14307' title='14307'>As we walked home together Holmes stopped at a telegraph office and sent off several wires.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14308' title='14308'>'You see, Watson,' he remarked, 'our evening has been by no means wasted. </span>
<span sid='14309' title='14309'>Some of my most interesting cases have come to me in this way through Mycroft. </span>
<span sid='14310' title='14310'>The problem which we have just listened to, although it can admit of but one explanation, has still some distinguishing features.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14311' title='14311'>'You have hopes of solving it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14312' title='14312'>'Well, knowing as much as we do, it will be singular indeed if we fail to discover the rest. </span>
<span sid='14313' title='14313'>You must yourself have formed some theory which will explain the facts to which we have listened.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14314' title='14314'>'In a vague way, yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14315' title='14315'>'What was your idea, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14316' title='14316'>'It seemed to me to be obvious that this Greek girl had been carried off by the young Englishman named Harold Latimer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14317' title='14317'>'Carried off from where?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14318' title='14318'>'<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Athens&t=h'>Athens</a>, perhaps.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14319' title='14319'>Sherlock Holmes shook his head. </span>
<span sid='14320' title='14320'>'This young man could not talk a word of Greek. </span>
<span sid='14321' title='14321'>The lady could talk English fairly well. </span>
<span sid='14322' title='14322'>Inference, that she had been in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> some little time, but he had not been in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Greece&t=h'>Greece</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14323' title='14323'>'Well, then, we will presume that she had come on a visit to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, and that this Harold had persuaded her to fly with him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14324' title='14324'>'That is the more probable.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14325' title='14325'>'Then the brother - for that, I fancy, must be the relationship - comes over from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Greece&t=h'>Greece</a> to interfere. </span>
<span sid='14326' title='14326'>He imprudently puts himself into the power of the young man and his older associate. </span>
<span sid='14327' title='14327'>They seize him and use violence towards him in order to make him sign some papers to make over the girl's fortune - of which he may be trustee - to them. </span>
<span sid='14328' title='14328'>This he refuses to do. </span>
<span sid='14329' title='14329'>In order to negotiate with him, they have to get an interpreter, and they pitch upon this Mr. Melas, having used some other one before. </span>
<span sid='14330' title='14330'>The girl is not told of the arrival of her brother, and finds it out by the merest accident.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14331' title='14331'>'Excellent, Watson,' cried Holmes. </span>
<span sid='14332' title='14332'>'I really fancy that you are not far from the truth. </span>
<span sid='14333' title='14333'>You see that we hold all the cards, and we have only to fear some sudden act of violence on their part. </span>
<span sid='14334' title='14334'>If they give us time we must have them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14335' title='14335'>'But how can we find where this house lies?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14336' title='14336'>'Well, if our conjecture is correct, and the girl's name is, or was, Sophy Kratides, we should have no difficulty in tracing her. </span>
<span sid='14337' title='14337'>That must be our main hope, for the brother, of course, is a complete stranger. </span>
<span sid='14338' title='14338'>It is clear that some time has elapsed since this Harold established these relations with the girl - some weeks at any rate - since the brother in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Greece&t=h'>Greece</a> has had time to hear of it, and come across. </span>
<span sid='14339' title='14339'>If they have been living in the same place during this time, it is probable that we shall have some answer to Mycroft's advertisement.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14340' title='14340'>We had reached our house in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> whilst we had been talking, Holmes ascended the stairs first, and as he opened the door of our room he gave a start of surprise. </span>
<span sid='14341' title='14341'>Looking over his shoulder I was equally astonished. </span>
<span sid='14342' title='14342'>His brother Mycroft was sitting smoking in the arm-chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14343' title='14343'>'Come in, Sherlock! </span>
<span sid='14344' title='14344'>Come in, sir,' said he, blandly, smiling at our surprised faces. </span>
<span sid='14345' title='14345'>'You don't expect such energy from me, do you, Sherlock? </span>
<span sid='14346' title='14346'>But somehow this case attracts me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14347' title='14347'>'How did you get here?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14348' title='14348'>'I passed you in a hansom.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14349' title='14349'>'There has been some new development?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14350' title='14350'>'I had an answer to my advertisement.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14351' title='14351'>'Ah!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14352' title='14352'>'Yes; it came within a few minutes of your leaving.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14353' title='14353'>'And to what effect?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14354' title='14354'>Mycroft Holmes took out a sheet of paper.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14355' title='14355'>'Here it is,' said he, 'written with a J pen on royal cream paper by a middle-aged man with a weak constitution. </span>
<span sid='14356' title='14356'>"Sir," he says, "in answer to your advertisement of to-day's date, I beg to inform you that I know the young lady in question very well. </span>
<span sid='14357' title='14357'>If you should care to call upon me, I could give you some particulars as to her painful history. </span>

<span sid='14360' title='14360'>'He writes from Lower <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a>,' said Mycroft Holmes. </span>
<span sid='14361' title='14361'>'Do you not think that we might drive to him now, Sherlock, and learn these particulars?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14362' title='14362'>'My dear Mycroft, the brother's life is more valuable than the sister's story. </span>
<span sid='14363' title='14363'>I think we should call at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a> for Inspector Gregson, and go straight out to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Beckenham&t=h'>Beckenham</a>. </span>

<p>
<span sid='14366' title='14366'>'Excellent!' said Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='14367' title='14367'>'Send the boy for a four-wheeler, and we shall be off at once.' </span>
<span sid='14368' title='14368'>He opened the table-drawer as he spoke, and I noticed that he slipped his revolver into his pocket. </span>
<span sid='14369' title='14369'>'Yes,' said he, in answer to my glance, 'I should say from what we have heard that we are dealing with a particularly dangerous gang.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14370' title='14370'>It was almost dark before we found ourselves in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pall Mall&t=h'>Pall Mall</a>, at the rooms of Mr. Melas. </span>
<span sid='14371' title='14371'>A gentleman had just called for him, and he was gone.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14372' title='14372'>'Can you tell me where?' asked Mycroft Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14373' title='14373'>'I don't know, sir,' answered the woman who had opened the door. </span>
<span sid='14374' title='14374'>'I only know that he drove away with the gentleman in a carriage.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14375' title='14375'>'Did the gentleman give a name?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14376' title='14376'>'No, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14377' title='14377'>'He wasn't a tall, handsome, dark young man?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14378' title='14378'>'Oh, no, sir; he was a little gentleman, with glasses, thin in the face, but very pleasant in his ways, for he was laughing all the time that he was talking.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14379' title='14379'>'Come along!' cried Sherlock Holmes, abruptly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14380' title='14380'>'This grows serious!' he observed, as we drove to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>. </span>
<span sid='14381' title='14381'>'These men have got hold of Melas again. </span>
<span sid='14382' title='14382'>He is a man of no physical courage, as they are well aware from their experience the other night. </span>
<span sid='14383' title='14383'>This villain was able to terrorize him the instant that he got into his presence. </span>
<span sid='14384' title='14384'>No doubt they want his professional services; but, having used him, they may be inclined to punish him for what they will regard as his treachery.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14385' title='14385'>Our hope was that by taking train we might get to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Beckenham&t=h'>Beckenham</a> as soon as, or sooner than, the carriage. </span>
<span sid='14386' title='14386'>On reaching <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>, however, it was more than an hour before we could get Inspector Gregson and comply with the legal formalities which would enable us to enter the house. </span>
<span sid='14387' title='14387'>It was a quarter to ten before we reached <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> Bridge, and half-past before the four of us alighted on the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Beckenham&t=h'>Beckenham</a> platform. </span>
<span sid='14388' title='14388'>A drive of half a mile brought us to The Myrtles - a large, dark house, standing back from the road in its own grounds. </span>
<span sid='14389' title='14389'>Here we dismissed our cab, and made our way up the drive together.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14390' title='14390'>'The windows are all dark,' remarked the Inspector.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14391' title='14391'>'The house seems deserted.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14392' title='14392'>'Our birds are flown and the nest empty,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14393' title='14393'>'Why do you say so?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14394' title='14394'>'A carriage heavily loaded with luggage has passed out during the last hour.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14395' title='14395'>The Inspector laughed. </span>
<span sid='14396' title='14396'>'I saw the wheel-tracks in the light of the gate-lamp, but where does the luggage come in?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14397' title='14397'>'You may have observed the same wheel-tracks going the other way. </span>
<span sid='14398' title='14398'>But the outward-bound ones were very much deeper - so much so that we can say for a certainty that there was a very considerable weight on the carriage.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14399' title='14399'>'You get a trifle beyond me there,' said the Inspector, shrugging his shoulders. </span>
<span sid='14400' title='14400'>'It will not be an easy door to force. </span>
<span sid='14401' title='14401'>But we will try if we cannot make someone hear us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14402' title='14402'>He hammered loudly at the knocker and pulled at the bell, but without any success. </span>
<span sid='14403' title='14403'>Holmes had slipped away, but he came back in a few minutes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14404' title='14404'>'I have a window open,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14405' title='14405'>'It is a mercy that you are on the side of the Force, and not against it, Mr. Holmes,' remarked the Inspector, as he noted the clever way in which my friend had forced back the catch. </span>
<span sid='14406' title='14406'>'Well, I think that, under the circumstances, we may enter without waiting for an invitation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14407' title='14407'>One after the other we made our way into a large apartment, which was evidently that in which Mr. Melas had found himself. </span>
<span sid='14408' title='14408'>The Inspector had lit his lantern, and by its light we could see the two doors, the curtain, the lamp and the suit of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Japan&t=h'>Japan</a>ese mail as he had described them. </span>
<span sid='14409' title='14409'>On the table stood two glasses, an empty brandy bottle, and the remains of a meal.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14410' title='14410'>'What is that?' asked Holmes, suddenly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14411' title='14411'>We all stood still and listened. </span>
<span sid='14412' title='14412'>A low, moaning sound was coming from somewhere above our heads. </span>
<span sid='14413' title='14413'>Holmes rushed to the door and out into the hall. </span>
<span sid='14414' title='14414'>The dismal noise came from upstairs. </span>
<span sid='14415' title='14415'>He dashed up, the Inspector and I at his heels, while his brother, Mycroft, followed as quickly as his great bulk would permit.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14416' title='14416'>Three doors faced us upon the second floor, and it was from the central of these that the sinister sounds were issuing, sinking sometimes into a dull mumble and rising again into a shrill whine. </span>
<span sid='14417' title='14417'>It was locked, but the key was on the outside. </span>
<span sid='14418' title='14418'>Holmes flung open the door and rushed in, but he was out again in an instant with his hand to his throat.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14419' title='14419'>'It's charcoal!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='14420' title='14420'>'Give it time. </span>
<span sid='14421' title='14421'>It will clear.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14422' title='14422'>Peering in, we could see that the only light in the room came from a dull, blue flame, which flickered from a small brass tripod in the centre. </span>
<span sid='14423' title='14423'>It threw a livid, unnatural circle upon the floor, while in the shadows beyond, we saw the vague loom of two figures, which crouched against the wall. </span>
<span sid='14424' title='14424'>From the open door there reeked a horrible, poisonous exhalation, which set us gasping and coughing. </span>
<span sid='14425' title='14425'>Holmes rushed to the top of the stairs to draw in the fresh air, and then, dashing into the room, he threw up the window and hurled the brazen tripod out into the garden.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14426' title='14426'>'We can enter in a minute,' he gasped, darting out again. </span>
<span sid='14427' title='14427'>'Where is a candle? </span>
<span sid='14428' title='14428'>I doubt if we could strike a match in that atmosphere. </span>
<span sid='14429' title='14429'>Hold the light at the door and we shall get them out, Mycroft. </span>
<span sid='14430' title='14430'>Now!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14431' title='14431'>With a rush we got to the poisoned men and dragged them out on to the landing. </span>
<span sid='14432' title='14432'>Both of them were blue-lipped and insensible, with swollen, congested faces and protruding eyes. </span>
<span sid='14433' title='14433'>Indeed, so distorted were their features that, save for his black beard and stout figure, we might have failed to recognize in one of them the Greek interpreter who had parted from us only a few hours before at the Diogenes Club. </span>
<span sid='14434' title='14434'>His hands and feet were securely strapped together and he bore over one eye the mark of a violent blow. </span>
<span sid='14435' title='14435'>The other, who was secured in a similar fashion, was a tall man in the last stage of emaciation, with several strips of sticking-plaster arranged in a grotesque pattern over his face. </span>
<span sid='14436' title='14436'>He had ceased to moan as we laid him down, and a glance showed me that for him, at least, our aid had come too late. </span>
<span sid='14437' title='14437'>Mr. Melas, however, still lived, and in less than an hour, with the aid of ammonia and brandy, I had the satisfaction of seeing him open his eyes, and of knowing that my hand had drawn him back from the dark valley in which all paths meet.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14438' title='14438'>It was a simple story which he had to tell, and one which did but confirm our own deductions. </span>
<span sid='14439' title='14439'>His visitor on entering his rooms had drawn a life-preserver from his sleeve, and had so impressed him with the fear of instant and inevitable death, that he had kidnapped him for the second time. </span>
<span sid='14440' title='14440'>Indeed, it was almost mesmeric the effect which this giggling ruffian had produced upon the unfortunate linguist, for he could not speak of him save with trembling hands and a blanched cheek. </span>
<span sid='14441' title='14441'>He had been taken swiftly to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Beckenham&t=h'>Beckenham</a>, and had acted as interpreter in a second interview, even more dramatic than the first, in which the two Englishmen had menaced their prisoner with instant death if he did not comply with their demands. </span>
<span sid='14442' title='14442'>Finally, finding him proof against every threat, they had hurled him back into his prison, and after reproaching Melas with his treachery, which appeared from the newspaper advertisements, they had stunned him with a blow from a stick, and he remembered nothing more until he found us bending over him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14443' title='14443'>And this was the singular case of the Grecian Interpreter, the explanation of which is still involved in some mystery. </span>
<span sid='14444' title='14444'>We were able to find out, by communicating with the gentleman who had answered the advertisement, that the unfortunate young lady came of a wealthy Grecian family, and that she had been on a visit to some friends in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>. </span>
<span sid='14445' title='14445'>While there she had met a young man named Harold Latimer, who had acquired an ascendancy over her, and had eventually persuaded her to fly with him. </span>
<span sid='14446' title='14446'>Her friends, shocked at the event, had contented themselves with informing her brother at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Athens&t=h'>Athens</a>, and had then washed their hands of the matter. </span>
<span sid='14447' title='14447'>The brother, on his arrival in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, had imprudently placed himself in the power of Latimer and of his associate, whose name was Wilson Kemp - a man of the foulest antecedents. </span>
<span sid='14448' title='14448'>These two, finding, that through his ignorance of the language, he was helpless in their hands, had kept him a prisoner, and had endeavoured, by cruelty and starvation, to make him sign away his own and his sister's property. </span>
<span sid='14449' title='14449'>They had kept him in the house without the girl's knowledge, and the plaster over the face had been for the purpose of making recognition difficult in case she should ever catch a glimpse of him. </span>
<span sid='14450' title='14450'>Her feminine perceptions, however, had instantly seen through the disguise when, on the occasion of the interpreter's first visit, she had seen him for the first time. </span>
<span sid='14451' title='14451'>The poor girl, however, was herself a prisoner, for there was no one about the house except the man who acted as coachman and his wife, both of whom were tools of the conspirators. </span>
<span sid='14452' title='14452'>Finding that their secret was out and that their prisoner was not to be coerced, the two villains, with the girl, had fled away at a few hours' notice from the furnished house which they had hired, having first, as they thought, taken vengeance both upon the man who had defied and the one who had betrayed them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14453' title='14453'>Months afterwards a curious newspaper cutting reached us from Buda-Pesth. </span>
<span sid='14454' title='14454'>It told how two Englishmen who had been travelling with a woman had met with a tragic end. </span>
<span sid='14455' title='14455'>They had each been stabbed, it seems, and the Hungarian police were of opinion that they had quarrelled and had inflicted mortal injuries upon each other. </span>
<span sid='14456' title='14456'>Holmes, however, is, I fancy, of a different way of thinking, and he holds to this day that if one could find the Grecian girl one might learn how the wrongs of herself and her brother came to be avenged.</span>
