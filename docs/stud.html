<p>
<span sid='33457' title='33457'>Part 1: Being a reprint from the reminiscences of John H. Watson MD, late of the Army Medical Department</span>
<p>
<span sid='33458' title='33458'>CHAPTER 1: Mr Sherlock Holmes</span>
<p>
<span sid='33459' title='33459'>In the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, and proceeded to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Netley&t=h'>Netley</a> to go through the course prescribed for surgeons in the army. </span>
<span sid='33460' title='33460'>Having completed my studies there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. </span>
<span sid='33461' title='33461'>The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. </span>
<span sid='33462' title='33462'>On landing at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bombay&t=h'>Bombay</a>, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and was already deep in the enemy's country. </span>
<span sid='33463' title='33463'>I followed, however, with many other officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded in reaching <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Candahar&t=h'>Candahar</a> in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once entered upon my new duties.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33464' title='33464'>The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had nothing but misfortune and disaster. </span>
<span sid='33465' title='33465'>I was removed from my brigade and attached to the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Berkshire&t=h'>Berkshire</a>s, with whom I served at the fatal battle of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Maiwand&t=h'>Maiwand</a>. </span>
<span sid='33466' title='33466'>There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. </span>
<span sid='33467' title='33467'>I should have fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33468' title='33468'>Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had undergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to the base hospital at Peshawur. </span>
<span sid='33469' title='33469'>Here I rallied, and had already improved so far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little upon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse of our Indian possessions. </span>
<span sid='33470' title='33470'>For months my life was despaired of, and when at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost in sending me back to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>. </span>
<span sid='33471' title='33471'>I was dispatched, accordingly, in the troopship Orontes, and landed a month later on <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Portsmouth&t=h'>Portsmouth</a> jetty, with my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33472' title='33472'>I had neither kith nor kin in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, and was therefore as free as air - or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit a man to be. </span>
<span sid='33473' title='33473'>Under such circumstances I naturally gravitated to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly drained. </span>
<span sid='33474' title='33474'>There I stayed for some time at a private hotel in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Strand&t=h'>the Strand</a>, leading a comfortless, meaningless existence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely than I ought. </span>
<span sid='33475' title='33475'>So alarming did the state of my finances become that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate somewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in my style of living. </span>
<span sid='33476' title='33476'>Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making up my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive domicile.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33477' title='33477'>On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Criterion Bar&t=h'>the Criterion Bar</a>, when someone tapped me on the shoulder, and turning round I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at Barts. </span>
<span sid='33478' title='33478'>The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. </span>
<span sid='33479' title='33479'>In old days Stamford had never been a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. </span>
<span sid='33480' title='33480'>In the exuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Holborn&t=h'>Holborn</a>, and we started off together in a hansom.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33481' title='33481'>Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?' he asked in undisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> streets. </span>
<span sid='33482' title='33482'>'You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33483' title='33483'>I gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it by the time that we reached our destination.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33484' title='33484'>'Poor devil!' he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my misfortunes. </span>
<span sid='33485' title='33485'>'What are you up to now?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33486' title='33486'>'Looking for lodgings,' I answered. </span>
<span sid='33487' title='33487'>'Trying to solve the problem as to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33488' title='33488'>'That's a strange thing,' remarked my companion, 'you are the second man to-day that has used that expression to me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33489' title='33489'>'And who was the first?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33490' title='33490'>'A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital. </span>
<span sid='33491' title='33491'>He was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which were too much for his purse.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33492' title='33492'>'By Jove!' I cried; gif he really wants some one to share the rooms and the expense, I am the very man for him. </span>
<span sid='33493' title='33493'>I should prefer having a partner to being alone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33494' title='33494'>Young Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. </span>
<span sid='33495' title='33495'>'You don't know Sherlock Holmes yet,' he said; 'perhaps you would not care for him as a constant companion.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33496' title='33496'>'Why, what is there against him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33497' title='33497'>'Oh, I didn't say there was anything against him. </span>
<span sid='33498' title='33498'>He is a little queer in his ideas - an enthusiast in some branches of science. </span>
<span sid='33499' title='33499'>As far as I know he is a decent fellow enough.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33500' title='33500'>'A medical student, I suppose?' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33501' title='33501'>'No - I have no idea what he intends to go in for. </span>
<span sid='33502' title='33502'>I believe he is well up in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know, he has never taken out any systematic medical classes. </span>
<span sid='33503' title='33503'>His studies are very desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the-way knowledge which would astonish his professors.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33504' title='33504'>'Did you never ask him what he was going in for?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33505' title='33505'>'No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be communicative enough when the fancy seizes him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33506' title='33506'>'I should like to meet him,' I said. </span>
<span sid='33507' title='33507'>'If I am to lodge with anyone, I should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. </span>
<span sid='33508' title='33508'>I am not strong enough yet to stand much noise or excitement. </span>
<span sid='33509' title='33509'>I had enough of both in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Afghanistan&t=h'>Afghanistan</a> to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. </span>
<span sid='33510' title='33510'>How could I meet this friend of yours?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33511' title='33511'>'He is sure to be at the laboratory,' returned my companion. </span>
<span sid='33512' title='33512'>'He either avoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning till night. </span>
<span sid='33513' title='33513'>If you like, we will drive round together after luncheon.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33514' title='33514'>'Certainly,' I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other channels.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33515' title='33515'>As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Holborn&t=h'>Holborn</a>, Stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to take as a fellow-lodger.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33516' title='33516'>'You mustn't blame me if you don't get on with him,' he said; 'I know nothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in the laboratory. </span>
<span sid='33517' title='33517'>You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me responsible.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33518' title='33518'>'If we don't get on it will be easy to part company,' I answered. </span>
<span sid='33519' title='33519'>'It seems to me, Stamford,' I added, looking hard at my companion, 'that you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter. </span>
<span sid='33520' title='33520'>Is this fellow's temper so formidable, or what is it? </span>
<span sid='33521' title='33521'>Don't be mealy-mouthed about it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33522' title='33522'>'It is not easy to express the inexpressible,' he answered with a laugh. </span>
<span sid='33523' title='33523'>'Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes - it approaches to cold-bloodedness. </span>
<span sid='33524' title='33524'>I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects. </span>
<span sid='33525' title='33525'>To do him justice, I think that he would take it himself with the same readiness. </span>
<span sid='33526' title='33526'>He appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33527' title='33527'>'Very right too.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33528' title='33528'>'Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. </span>
<span sid='33529' title='33529'>When it comes to beating the subjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking rather a bizarre shape.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33530' title='33530'>'Beating the subjects!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33531' title='33531'>'Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. </span>
<span sid='33532' title='33532'>I saw him at it with my own eyes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33533' title='33533'>'And yet you say he is not a medical student?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33534' title='33534'>'No. </span>
<span sid='33535' title='33535'>Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. </span>
<span sid='33536' title='33536'>But here we are, and you must form your own impressions about him.' </span>
<span sid='33537' title='33537'>As he spoke, we turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door which opened into a wing of the great hospital. </span>
<span sid='33538' title='33538'>It was familiar ground to me, and I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and made our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall and dun-coloured doors. </span>
<span sid='33539' title='33539'>Near the farther end a low arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33540' title='33540'>This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles. </span>
<span sid='33541' title='33541'>Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts, test-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps with their blue flickering flames. </span>
<span sid='33542' title='33542'>There was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant table absorbed in his work. </span>
<span sid='33543' title='33543'>At the sound of our steps he glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. </span>
<span sid='33544' title='33544'>'I've found it! </span>
<span sid='33545' title='33545'>I've found it,' he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a test-tube in his hand. </span>
<span sid='33546' title='33546'>'I have found a re-agent which is precipitated by haemoglobin, and by nothing else.' </span>
<span sid='33547' title='33547'>Had he discovered a gold mine, greater delight could not have shone upon his features.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33548' title='33548'>'Dr Watson, Mr Sherlock Holmes,' said Stamford, introducing us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33549' title='33549'>'How are you?' he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength for which I should hardly have given him credit. </span>
<span sid='33550' title='33550'>'You have been in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Afghanistan&t=h'>Afghanistan</a>, I perceive.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33551' title='33551'>'How on earth did you know that?' I asked in astonishment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33552' title='33552'>'Never mind,' said he, chuckling to himself. </span>
<span sid='33553' title='33553'>'The question now is about haemoglobin. </span>
<span sid='33554' title='33554'>No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33555' title='33555'>'It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,' I answered, 'but practically-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33556' title='33556'>'Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years. </span>
<span sid='33557' title='33557'>Don't you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains. </span>
<span sid='33558' title='33558'>Come over here now!' </span>
<span sid='33559' title='33559'>He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness, and drew me over to the table at which he had been working. </span>
<span sid='33560' title='33560'>'Let us have some fresh blood,' he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger, and drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette. </span>
<span sid='33561' title='33561'>'Now, I add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water. </span>
<span sid='33562' title='33562'>You perceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water. </span>
<span sid='33563' title='33563'>The proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million. </span>
<span sid='33564' title='33564'>I have no doubt, however, that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction.' </span>
<span sid='33565' title='33565'>As he spoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals, and then added some drops of a transparent fluid. </span>
<span sid='33566' title='33566'>In an instant the contents assumed a dull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the glass jar.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33567' title='33567'>'Ha! ha!' he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a child with a new toy. </span>
<span sid='33568' title='33568'>'What do you think of that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33569' title='33569'>'It seems to be a very delicate test,' I remarked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33570' title='33570'>'Beautiful! beautiful! </span>
<span sid='33571' title='33571'>The old guaiacum test was very clumsy and uncertain. </span>
<span sid='33572' title='33572'>So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. </span>
<span sid='33573' title='33573'>The latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. </span>
<span sid='33574' title='33574'>Now, this appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new. </span>
<span sid='33575' title='33575'>Had this test been invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33576' title='33576'>'Indeed!' I murmured.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33577' title='33577'>'Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. </span>
<span sid='33578' title='33578'>A man is suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. </span>
<span sid='33579' title='33579'>His linen or clothes are examined and brownish stains discovered upon them. </span>
<span sid='33580' title='33580'>Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains, or what are they? </span>
<span sid='33581' title='33581'>That is a question which has puzzled many an expert, and why? </span>
<span sid='33582' title='33582'>Because there was no reliable test. </span>
<span sid='33583' title='33583'>Now we have the Sherlock Holmes test, and there will no longer be any difficulty.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33584' title='33584'>His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his imagination.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33585' title='33585'>'You are to be congratulated,' I remarked, considerably surprised at his enthusiasm.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33586' title='33586'>'There was the case of Von Bischoff at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Frankfort&t=h'>Frankfort</a> last year. </span>
<span sid='33587' title='33587'>He would certainly have been hung had this test been in existence. </span>
<span sid='33588' title='33588'>Then there was Mason of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bradford&t=h'>Bradford</a>, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Montpellier&t=h'>Montpellier</a>, and Samson of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=New Orleans&t=h'>New Orleans</a>. </span>
<span sid='33589' title='33589'>I could name a score of cases in which it would have been decisive.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33590' title='33590'>'You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,' said Stamford with a laugh. </span>
<span sid='33591' title='33591'>'You might start a paper on those lines. </span>
<span sid='33592' title='33592'>Call it the "Police News of the Past".'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33593' title='33593'>'Very interesting reading it might be made, too,' remarked Sherlock Holmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger. </span>
<span sid='33594' title='33594'>'I have to be careful,' he continued, turning to me with a smile, 'for I dabble with poisons a good deal.' </span>
<span sid='33595' title='33595'>He held out his hand as he spoke, and I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster, and discoloured with strong acids.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33596' title='33596'>'We came here on business,' said Stamford, sitting down on a high three-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with his foot. </span>
<span sid='33597' title='33597'>'My friend here wants to take diggings; and as you were complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I thought that I had better bring you together.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33598' title='33598'>Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with me. </span>
<span sid='33599' title='33599'>'I have my eye on a suite in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>,' he said, 'which would suit us down to the ground. </span>
<span sid='33600' title='33600'>You don't mind the smell of strong tobacco, I hope?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33601' title='33601'>'I always smoke "ship's" myself,' I answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33602' title='33602'>'That's good enough. </span>
<span sid='33603' title='33603'>I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally do experiments. </span>
<span sid='33604' title='33604'>Would that annoy you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33605' title='33605'>'By no means.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33606' title='33606'>'Let me see - what are my other shortcomings. </span>
<span sid='33607' title='33607'>I get in the dumps at times, and don't open my mouth for days on end. </span>
<span sid='33608' title='33608'>You must not think I am sulky when I do that. </span>
<span sid='33609' title='33609'>Just let me alone, and I'll soon be right. </span>
<span sid='33610' title='33610'>What have you to confess now? </span>
<span sid='33611' title='33611'>It's just as well for two fellows to know the worst of one another before they begin to live together.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33612' title='33612'>I laughed at this cross-examination. </span>
<span sid='33613' title='33613'>'I keep a bull pup,' I said, 'and I object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all sorts of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. </span>
<span sid='33614' title='33614'>I have another set of vices when I'm well, but those are the principal ones at present.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33615' title='33615'>'Do you include violin playing in your category of rows?' he asked, anxiously.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33616' title='33616'>'It depends on the player,' I answered. </span>
<span sid='33617' title='33617'>'A well-played violin is a treat for the gods - a badly-played one-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33618' title='33618'>'Oh, that's all right,' he cried, with a merry laugh. </span>
<span sid='33619' title='33619'>'I think we may consider the thing as settled - that is, if the rooms are agreeable to you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33620' title='33620'>'When shall we see them?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33621' title='33621'>'Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we'll go together and settle everything,' he answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33622' title='33622'>'All right - noon exactly,' said I, shaking his hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33623' title='33623'>We left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards my hotel.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33624' title='33624'>'By the way,' I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford, 'how the deuce did he know that I had come from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Afghanistan&t=h'>Afghanistan</a>?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33625' title='33625'>My companion smiled an enigmatical smile. </span>
<span sid='33626' title='33626'>'That's just his little peculiarity,' he said. </span>
<span sid='33627' title='33627'>'A good many people have wanted to know how he finds things out.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33628' title='33628'>'Oh! a mystery is it?' I cried, rubbing my hands. </span>
<span sid='33629' title='33629'>'This is very piquant. </span>
<span sid='33630' title='33630'>I am much obliged to you for bringing us together. </span>
<span sid='33631' title='33631'>"The proper study of mankind is man," you know.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33632' title='33632'>'You must study him, then,' Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye. </span>
<span sid='33633' title='33633'>'You'll find him a knotty problem, though. </span>
<span sid='33634' title='33634'>I'll wager he learns more about you than you about him. </span>
<span sid='33635' title='33635'>'Good-bye.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33636' title='33636'>'Good-bye,' I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably interested in my new acquaintance.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33637' title='33637'>CHAPTER 2: The Science of Deduction</span>
<p>
<span sid='33638' title='33638'>We met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No. 221B, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>, of which he had spoken at our meeting. </span>
<span sid='33639' title='33639'>They consisted of a couple of comfortable bedrooms and a single large airy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad windows. </span>
<span sid='33640' title='33640'>So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate did the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was concluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession. </span>
<span sid='33641' title='33641'>That very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and portmanteaus. </span>
<span sid='33642' title='33642'>For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and laying out our property to the best advantage. </span>
<span sid='33643' title='33643'>That done, we gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surroundings.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33644' title='33644'>Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. </span>
<span sid='33645' title='33645'>He was quiet in his ways, and his habits were regular. </span>
<span sid='33646' title='33646'>It was rare for him to be up after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in the morning. </span>
<span sid='33647' title='33647'>Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the city. </span>
<span sid='33648' title='33648'>Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night. </span>
<span sid='33649' title='33649'>On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33650' title='33650'>As the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his aims in life gradually deepened and increased. </span>
<span sid='33651' title='33651'>His very person and appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer. </span>
<span sid='33652' title='33652'>In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively lean that he seemed to be considerably taller. </span>
<span sid='33653' title='33653'>His eyes were sharp and piercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded; and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision. </span>
<span sid='33654' title='33654'>His chin, too, had the prominence and squareness which mark the man of determination. </span>
<span sid='33655' title='33655'>His hands were invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33656' title='33656'>The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how much this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured to break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned himself. </span>
<span sid='33657' title='33657'>Before pronouncing judgement, however, be it remembered how objectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my attention. </span>
<span sid='33658' title='33658'>My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was exceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me and break the monotony of my daily existence. </span>
<span sid='33659' title='33659'>Under these circumstances I eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my companion, and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33660' title='33660'>He was not studying medicine. </span>
<span sid='33661' title='33661'>He had himself, in reply to a question, confirmed Stamford's opinion in that point. </span>
<span sid='33662' title='33662'>Neither did he appear to have pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in science or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance into the learned world. </span>
<span sid='33663' title='33663'>Yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable, and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly astounded me. </span>
<span sid='33664' title='33664'>Surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had some definite end in view. </span>
<span sid='33665' title='33665'>Desultory readers are seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning. </span>
<span sid='33666' title='33666'>No man burdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good reason for doing so.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33667' title='33667'>His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. </span>
<span sid='33668' title='33668'>Of contemporary literature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing. </span>
<span sid='33669' title='33669'>Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way who he might be and what he had done. </span>
<span sid='33670' title='33670'>My surprise reached a climax, however, when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System. </span>
<span sid='33671' title='33671'>That any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33672' title='33672'>'You appear to be astonished,' he said, smiling at my expression of surprise. </span>
<span sid='33673' title='33673'>'Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33674' title='33674'>'To forget it!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33675' title='33675'>'You see,' he explained, 'I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. </span>
<span sid='33676' title='33676'>A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things, so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. </span>
<span sid='33677' title='33677'>Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. </span>
<span sid='33678' title='33678'>He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. </span>
<span sid='33679' title='33679'>It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. </span>
<span sid='33680' title='33680'>Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. </span>
<span sid='33681' title='33681'>It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33682' title='33682'>'But the Solar System!' I protested.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33683' title='33683'>'What the deuce is it to me?' he interrupted impatiently: 'you say that we go round the sun. </span>
<span sid='33684' title='33684'>If we went round the moon it would not make a penny-worth of difference to me or to my work.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33685' title='33685'>I was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but something in his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one. </span>
<span sid='33686' title='33686'>I pondered over our short conversation, however, and endeavoured to draw my deductions from it. </span>
<span sid='33687' title='33687'>He said that he would acquire no knowledge which did not bear upon his object. </span>
<span sid='33688' title='33688'>Therefore all the knowledge which he possessed was such as would be useful to him. </span>
<span sid='33689' title='33689'>I enumerated in my own mind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was exceptionally well-informed. </span>
<span sid='33690' title='33690'>I even took a pencil and jotted them down.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33691' title='33691'>I could not help smiling at the document when I had completed it. </span>
<span sid='33692' title='33692'>It ran in this way:</span>
<p>
<span sid='33693' title='33693'>SHERLOCK HOLMES - his limits</span>
<p>
<span sid='33694' title='33694'>1 Knowledge of Literature. </span>
<span sid='33695' title='33695'>- Nil.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33696' title='33696'>2 Knowledge of Philosophy. </span>

<span sid='33699' title='33699'>- Nil.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33700' title='33700'>4 Knowledge of Politics. </span>
<span sid='33701' title='33701'>- Feeble.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33702' title='33702'>5 Knowledge of Botany. </span>
<span sid='33703' title='33703'>- Variable. </span>
<span sid='33704' title='33704'>Well up in belladonna, opium, and poisons generally. </span>
<span sid='33705' title='33705'>Knows nothing of practical gardening.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33706' title='33706'>6 Knowledge of Geology: </span>
<span sid='33707' title='33707'>Practical, but limited. </span>
<span sid='33708' title='33708'>Tells at a glance different soils from each other. </span>
<span sid='33709' title='33709'>After walks has shown me splashes upon his trousers, and told me by their colour and consistence in what part of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> he had received them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33710' title='33710'>7 Knowledge of Chemistry. </span>
<span sid='33711' title='33711'>- Profound.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33712' title='33712'>8 Knowledge of Anatomy. </span>
<span sid='33713' title='33713'>- Accurate, but unsystematic.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33714' title='33714'>9 Knowledge of Sensational Literature. </span>
<span sid='33715' title='33715'>- Immense. </span>
<span sid='33716' title='33716'>He appears to know every detail of every horror perpetrated in the century.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33717' title='33717'>10 Plays the violin well.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33718' title='33718'>11 Is an expert singlestick player, boxer, and swordsman.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33719' title='33719'>12 Has a good practical knowledge of British law.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33720' title='33720'>When I had got so far in my list I threw it into the fire in despair. </span>
<span sid='33721' title='33721'>'If I can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all these accomplishments, and discovering a calling which needs them all,' I said to myself, 'I may as well give up the attempt at once.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33722' title='33722'>I see that I have alluded above to his powers upon the violin. </span>
<span sid='33723' title='33723'>These were very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his other accomplishments. </span>
<span sid='33724' title='33724'>That he could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I knew well, because at my request he has played me some of Mendelssohn's Lieder, and other favourites. </span>
<span sid='33725' title='33725'>When left to himself, however, he would seldom produce any music or attempt any recognized air. </span>
<span sid='33726' title='33726'>Leaning back in his arm-chair of an evening, he would close his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee. </span>
<span sid='33727' title='33727'>Sometimes the chords were sonorous and melancholy. </span>
<span sid='33728' title='33728'>Occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful. </span>
<span sid='33729' title='33729'>Clearly they reflected the thoughts which possessed him, but whether the music aided those thoughts, or whether the playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy, was more than I could determine. </span>
<span sid='33730' title='33730'>I might have rebelled against these exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated them by playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a slight compensation for the trial upon my patience.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33731' title='33731'>During the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to think that my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself. </span>
<span sid='33732' title='33732'>Presently, however, I found that he had many acquaintances, and those in the most different classes of society. </span>
<span sid='33733' title='33733'>There was one little sallow, rat-faced, dark-eyed fellow, who was introduced to me as Mr Lestrade, and who came three or four times in a single week. </span>
<span sid='33734' title='33734'>One morning a young girl called, fashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more. </span>
<span sid='33735' title='33735'>The same afternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor, looking like a Jew pedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closely followed by a slip-shod elderly woman. </span>
<span sid='33736' title='33736'>On another occasion an old white-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and on another, a railway porter in his velveteen uniform. </span>
<span sid='33737' title='33737'>When any of these nondescript individuals put in an appearance, Sherlock Holmes used to beg for the use of the sitting-room, and I would retire to my bed-room. </span>
<span sid='33738' title='33738'>He always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience. </span>
<span sid='33739' title='33739'>'I have to use this room as a place of business,' he said, 'and these people are my clients.' </span>
<span sid='33740' title='33740'>Again I had an opportunity of asking him a point-blank question, and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to confide in me. </span>
<span sid='33741' title='33741'>I imagined at the time that he had some strong reason for not alluding to it, but he soon dispelled the idea by coming round to the subject of his own accord.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33742' title='33742'>It was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I rose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had not yet finished his breakfast. </span>
<span sid='33743' title='33743'>The landlady had become so accustomed to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared. </span>
<span sid='33744' title='33744'>With the unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell and gave a curt intimation that I was ready. </span>
<span sid='33745' title='33745'>Then I picked up a magazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it, while my companion munched silently at his toast. </span>
<span sid='33746' title='33746'>One of the articles had a pencil mark at the heading, and I naturally began to run my eye through it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33747' title='33747'>Its somewhat ambitious tide was 'The Book of Life', and it attempted to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic examination of all that came in his way. </span>
<span sid='33748' title='33748'>It struck me as being a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. </span>
<span sid='33749' title='33749'>The reasoning was close and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to be far-fetched and exaggerated. </span>
<span sid='33750' title='33750'>The writer claimed by a momentary expression, a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a man's inmost thoughts. </span>
<span sid='33751' title='33751'>Deceit, according to him, was an impossibility in the case of one trained to observation and analysis. </span>
<span sid='33752' title='33752'>His conclusions were as infallible as so many propositions of Euclid. </span>
<span sid='33753' title='33753'>So startling would his results appear to the uninitiated that until they learned the processes by which he had arrived at them they might well consider him as a necromancer.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33754' title='33754'>'From a drop of water,' said the writer, 'a logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Niagara&t=h'>Niagara</a> without having seen or heard of one or the other. </span>
<span sid='33755' title='33755'>So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it. </span>
<span sid='33756' title='33756'>Like all other arts, the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired by long and patient study, nor is life long enough to allow any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection in it. </span>
<span sid='33757' title='33757'>Before turning to these mortal and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest difficulties, let the inquirer begin by mastering more elementary problems. </span>
<span sid='33758' title='33758'>Let him on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to distinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession to which he belongs. </span>
<span sid='33759' title='33759'>Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the faculties of observation, and teaches one where to look and what to look for. </span>
<span sid='33760' title='33760'>By a man's finger-nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by his trouser-knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his expression, by his shirt-cuffs - by each of these things a man's calling is plainly revealed. </span>
<span sid='33761' title='33761'>That all united should fail to enlighten the competent inquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33762' title='33762'>'What ineffable twaddle!' I cried, slapping the magazine down on the table; 'I never read such rubbish in my life.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33763' title='33763'>'What is it?' asked Sherlock Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33764' title='33764'>'Why, this article,' I said, pointing at it with my egg-spoon as I sat down to my breakfast. </span>
<span sid='33765' title='33765'>'I see that you have read it since you have marked it. </span>
<span sid='33766' title='33766'>I don't deny that it is smartly written. </span>
<span sid='33767' title='33767'>It irritates me, though. </span>
<span sid='33768' title='33768'>It is evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who evolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study. </span>
<span sid='33769' title='33769'>It is not practical. </span>
<span sid='33770' title='33770'>I should like to see him clapped down in a third- class carriage on the Underground, and asked to give the trades of all his fellow-travellers. </span>
<span sid='33771' title='33771'>I would lay a thousand to one against him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33772' title='33772'>'You would lose your money,' Holmes remarked calmly. </span>
<span sid='33773' title='33773'>'As for the article, I wrote it myself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33774' title='33774'>'You!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33775' title='33775'>'Yes; I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. </span>
<span sid='33776' title='33776'>The theories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be so chimerical, are really extremely practical - so practical that I depend upon them for my bread and cheese.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33777' title='33777'>'And how?' I asked involuntarily.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33778' title='33778'>'Well, I have a trade of my own. </span>
<span sid='33779' title='33779'>I suppose I am the only one in the world. </span>
<span sid='33780' title='33780'>I'm a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is. </span>
<span sid='33781' title='33781'>Here in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> we have lots of Government detectives and lots of private ones. </span>
<span sid='33782' title='33782'>When these fellows are at fault, they come to me, and I manage to put them on the right scent. </span>
<span sid='33783' title='33783'>They lay all the evidence before me, and I am generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history of crime, to set them straight. </span>
<span sid='33784' title='33784'>There is a strong family resemblance about misdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your finger ends, it is odd if you can't unravel the thousand and first. </span>
<span sid='33785' title='33785'>Lestrade is a well-known detective. </span>
<span sid='33786' title='33786'>He got himself into a fog recently over a forgery case, and that was what brought him here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33787' title='33787'>'And these other people?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33788' title='33788'>'They are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. </span>
<span sid='33789' title='33789'>They are all people who are in trouble about something and want a little enlightening. </span>
<span sid='33790' title='33790'>I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, and then I pocket my fee.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33791' title='33791'>'But do you mean to say,' I said, 'that without leaving your room you can unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although they have seen every detail for themselves?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33792' title='33792'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='33793' title='33793'>I have a kind of intuition that way. </span>
<span sid='33794' title='33794'>Now and again a case turns up which is a little more complex. </span>
<span sid='33795' title='33795'>Then I have to bustle about and see things with my own eyes. </span>
<span sid='33796' title='33796'>You see I have a lot of special knowledge which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters wonderfully. </span>
<span sid='33797' title='33797'>Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your scorn are invaluable to me in practical work. </span>
<span sid='33798' title='33798'>Observation with me is second nature. </span>
<span sid='33799' title='33799'>You appeared to be surprised when I told you, on our first meeting, that you had come from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Afghanistan&t=h'>Afghanistan</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33800' title='33800'>'You were told, no doubt.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33801' title='33801'>'Nothing of the sort. </span>
<span sid='33802' title='33802'>I knew you came from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Afghanistan&t=h'>Afghanistan</a>. </span>
<span sid='33803' title='33803'>From long habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind that I arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps. </span>
<span sid='33804' title='33804'>There were such steps, however. </span>
<span sid='33805' title='33805'>The train of reasoning ran: </span>
<span sid='33806' title='33806'>"Here is a gentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military man. </span>
<span sid='33807' title='33807'>Clearly an army doctor then. </span>
<span sid='33808' title='33808'>He has just come from the tropics, for his face is dark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for his wrists are fair. </span>
<span sid='33809' title='33809'>He has undergone hardship and sickness, as his haggard face says clearly. </span>
<span sid='33810' title='33810'>His left arm has been injured. </span>
<span sid='33811' title='33811'>He holds it in a stiff and unnatural manner. </span>
<span sid='33812' title='33812'>Where in the tropics could an English army doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded? </span>
<span sid='33813' title='33813'>Clearly in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Afghanistan&t=h'>Afghanistan</a>." </span>
<span sid='33814' title='33814'>The whole train of thought did not occupy a second. </span>
<span sid='33815' title='33815'>I then remarked that you came from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Afghanistan&t=h'>Afghanistan</a>, and you were astonished.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33816' title='33816'>'It is simple enough as you explain it,' I said, smiling. </span>
<span sid='33817' title='33817'>'You remind me of Edgar Allan Poe's Dupin. </span>
<span sid='33818' title='33818'>I had no idea that such individuals did exist outside of stories.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33819' title='33819'>Sherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe. </span>
<span sid='33820' title='33820'>'No doubt you think that you are complimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,' he observed. </span>
<span sid='33821' title='33821'>'Now, in my opinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. </span>
<span sid='33822' title='33822'>That trick of his of breaking in on his friends' thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of an hour's silence is really very showy and superficial. </span>
<span sid='33823' title='33823'>He had some analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a phenomenon as Poe appeared to imagine.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33824' title='33824'>'Have you read Gaboriau's works?' I asked. </span>
<span sid='33825' title='33825'>'Does Lecoq come up to your idea of a detective?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33826' title='33826'>Sherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. </span>
<span sid='33827' title='33827'>Lecoq was a miserable bungler,' he said, in an angry voice; 'he had only one thing to recommend him, and that was his energy. </span>
<span sid='33828' title='33828'>That book made me positively ill. </span>
<span sid='33829' title='33829'>The question was how to identify an unknown prisoner. </span>
<span sid='33830' title='33830'>I could have done it in twenty-four hours. </span>
<span sid='33831' title='33831'>Lecoq took six months or so. </span>
<span sid='33832' title='33832'>It might be made a text-book for detectives to teach them what to avoid.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33833' title='33833'>I felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired treated in this cavalier style. </span>
<span sid='33834' title='33834'>I walked over to the window, and stood looking out into the busy street. </span>
<span sid='33835' title='33835'>'This fellow may be very clever,' I said to myself, 'but he is certainly very conceited.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33836' title='33836'>'There are no crimes and no criminals in these days,' he said, querulously. </span>
<span sid='33837' title='33837'>'What is the use of having brains in our profession? </span>
<span sid='33838' title='33838'>I know well that I have it in me to make my name famous. </span>
<span sid='33839' title='33839'>No man lives or has ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural talent to the detection of crime which I have done. </span>
<span sid='33840' title='33840'>And what is the result? </span>
<span sid='33841' title='33841'>There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling villainy with a motive so transparent that even a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a> official can see through it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33842' title='33842'>I was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. </span>
<span sid='33843' title='33843'>I thought it best to change the topic.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33844' title='33844'>'I wonder what that fellow is looking for?' I asked, pointing to a stalwart, plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the other side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers. </span>
<span sid='33845' title='33845'>He had a large blue envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of a message.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33846' title='33846'>'You mean the retired sergeant of Marines,' said Sherlock Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33847' title='33847'>'Brag and bounce!' thought I to myself. </span>
<span sid='33848' title='33848'>'He knows that I cannot verify his guess.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33849' title='33849'>The thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were watching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across the roadway. </span>
<span sid='33850' title='33850'>We heard a loud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy steps ascending the stair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33851' title='33851'>Tor Mr Sherlock Holmes,' he said, stepping into the room and handing my friend the letter.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33852' title='33852'>Here was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him. </span>
<span sid='33853' title='33853'>He little thought of this when he made that random shot. </span>
<span sid='33854' title='33854'>'May I ask, my lad,' I said, in the blandest voice, 'what your trade may be?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33855' title='33855'>'Commissionaire, sir,' he said, gruffly. </span>
<span sid='33856' title='33856'>'Uniform away for repairs.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33857' title='33857'>'And you were?' I asked, with a slightly malicious glance at my companion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33858' title='33858'>'A sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir. </span>
<span sid='33859' title='33859'>No answer? </span>
<span sid='33860' title='33860'>Right, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33861' title='33861'>He clicked his heels together, raised his hand in a salute, and was gone.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33862' title='33862'>CHAPTER 3: The Lauriston Gardens Mystery</span>
<p>
<span sid='33863' title='33863'>I confess that I was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the practical nature of my companion's theories. </span>
<span sid='33864' title='33864'>My respect for his powers of analysis increased wondrously. </span>
<span sid='33865' title='33865'>There still remained some lurking suspicion in my mind, however, that the whole thing was a prearranged episode, intended to dazzle me, though what earthly object he could have in taking me in was past my comprehension. </span>
<span sid='33866' title='33866'>When I looked at him, he had finished reading the note, and his eyes had assumed the vacant, lack-lustre expression which showed mental abstraction.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33867' title='33867'>'How in the world did you deduce that?' I asked. </span>
<span sid='33868' title='33868'>'Deduce what?' said he, petulantly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33869' title='33869'>'Why, that he was a retired sergeant of Marines.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33870' title='33870'>'I have no time for trifles,' he answered brusquely; then with a smile: 'Excuse my rudeness. </span>
<span sid='33871' title='33871'>You broke the thread of my thoughts; but perhaps it is as well. </span>
<span sid='33872' title='33872'>So you actually were not able to see that that man was a sergeant of Marines?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33873' title='33873'>'No, indeed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33874' title='33874'>'It was easier to know it than to explain why I know it. </span>
<span sid='33875' title='33875'>If you were asked to prove that two and two made four, you might find some difficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact. </span>
<span sid='33876' title='33876'>Even across the street I could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the fellow's hand. </span>
<span sid='33877' title='33877'>That smacked of the sea. </span>
<span sid='33878' title='33878'>He had a military carriage, however, and regulation side whiskers. </span>
<span sid='33879' title='33879'>There we have the marine. </span>
<span sid='33880' title='33880'>He was a man with some amount of self-importance and a certain air of command. </span>
<span sid='33881' title='33881'>You must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung his cane. </span>
<span sid='33882' title='33882'>A steady, respectable, middle-aged man, too, on the face of him - all facts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33883' title='33883'>'Wonderful!' I ejaculated.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33884' title='33884'>'Commonplace,' said Holmes, though I thought from his expression that he was pleased at my evident surprise and admiration. </span>
<span sid='33885' title='33885'>'I said just now that there were no criminals. </span>
<span sid='33886' title='33886'>It appears that I am wrong - look at this!' </span>
<span sid='33887' title='33887'>He threw me over the note which the commissionaire had brought.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33888' title='33888'>'Why,' I cried, as I cast my eye over it, 'this is terrible!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33889' title='33889'>'It does seem to be a little out of the common,' he remarked, calmly. </span>
<span sid='33890' title='33890'>'Would you mind reading it to me aloud?' </span>
<span sid='33891' title='33891'>This is the letter which I read to him:</span>
<p>
<span sid='33892' title='33892'>"My dear Mr Sherlock Holmes, There has been a bad business during the night at 3, Lauriston Gardens, off the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a> Road. </span>
<span sid='33893' title='33893'>Our man on the beat saw a light there about two in the morning, and as the house was an empty one, suspected that something was amiss. </span>
<span sid='33894' title='33894'>He found the door open, and in the front room, which is bare of furniture, discovered the body of a gentleman, well dressed, and having cards in his pocket bearing the name of 'Enoch J. </span>
<span sid='33895' title='33895'>Drebber, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Cleveland&t=h'>Cleveland</a>, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ohio&t=h'>Ohio</a>, U.S.A.' </span>
<span sid='33896' title='33896'>There had been no robbery, nor is there any evidence as to how the man met his death. </span>
<span sid='33897' title='33897'>There are marks of blood in the room, but there is no wound upon his person. </span>
<span sid='33898' title='33898'>We are at a loss as to how he came into the empty house; indeed, the whole affair is a puzzler. </span>
<span sid='33899' title='33899'>If you can come round to the house any time before twelve, you will find me there. </span>
<span sid='33900' title='33900'>I have left everything in statu quo until I hear from you. </span>
<span sid='33901' title='33901'>If you are unable to come, I shall give you fuller details, and would esteem it a great kindness if you would favour me with your opinion. </span>
<span sid='33902' title='33902'>Yours faithfully, TOBIAS GREGSON."</span>
<p>
<span sid='33903' title='33903'>'Gregson is the smartest of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>ers,' my friend remarked; 'he and Lestrade are the pick of a bad lot. </span>
<span sid='33904' title='33904'>They are both quick and energetic, but conventional -  shockingly so. </span>
<span sid='33905' title='33905'>They have their knives into one another, too. </span>
<span sid='33906' title='33906'>They are as jealous as a pair of professional beauties. </span>
<span sid='33907' title='33907'>There will be some fun over this case if they are both put upon the scent.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33908' title='33908'>I was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on. </span>
<span sid='33909' title='33909'>'Surely there is not a moment to be lost,' I cried; 'shall I go and order you a cab?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33910' title='33910'>'I'm not sure about whether I shall go. </span>
<span sid='33911' title='33911'>I am the most incurably lazy devil that ever stood in shoe leather - that is, when the fit is on me, for I can be spry enough at times.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33912' title='33912'>'Why, it is just such a chance as you have been longing for.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33913' title='33913'>'My dear fellow, what does it matter to me? </span>
<span sid='33914' title='33914'>Supposing I unravel the whole matter, you may be sure that Gregson, Lestrade, and Co. will pocket all the credit. </span>
<span sid='33915' title='33915'>That comes of being an unofficial personage.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33916' title='33916'>'But he begs you to help him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33917' title='33917'>'Yes. </span>
<span sid='33918' title='33918'>He knows that I am his superior, and acknowledges it to me; but he would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person. </span>
<span sid='33919' title='33919'>However, we may as well go and have a look. </span>
<span sid='33920' title='33920'>I shall work it out on my own hook. </span>
<span sid='33921' title='33921'>I may have a laugh at them, if I have nothing else. </span>
<span sid='33922' title='33922'>Come on!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33923' title='33923'>He hustled on his overcoat, and bustled about in a way that showed that an energetic fit had superseded the apathetic one.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33924' title='33924'>'Get your hat,' he said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33925' title='33925'>'You wish me to come?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33926' title='33926'>'Yes, if you have nothing better to do.' </span>
<span sid='33927' title='33927'>A minute later we were both in a hansom, driving furiously for the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a> Road.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33928' title='33928'>It was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a dun-coloured veil hung over the house-tops, looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streets beneath. </span>
<span sid='33929' title='33929'>My companion was in the best of spirits, and prattled away about Cremona fiddles, and the difference between a Stradivarius and an Amati. </span>
<span sid='33930' title='33930'>As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather and the melancholy business upon which we were engaged, depressed my spirits.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33931' title='33931'>'You don't seem to give much thought to the matter in hand,' I said at last, interrupting Holmes's musical disquisition.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33932' title='33932'>'No data yet,' he answered. </span>
<span sid='33933' title='33933'>'It is a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence. </span>
<span sid='33934' title='33934'>It biases the judgement.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33935' title='33935'>'You will have your data soon,' I remarked, pointing with my finger; 'this is the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a> Road, and that is the house, if I am not very much mistaken.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33936' title='33936'>'So it is. </span>
<span sid='33937' title='33937'>Stop, driver, stop!' </span>
<span sid='33938' title='33938'>We were still a hundred yards or so from it, but he insisted upon our alighting, and we finished our journey upon foot.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33939' title='33939'>Number 3, Lauriston Gardens, wore an ill-omened and minatory look. </span>
<span sid='33940' title='33940'>It was one of four which stood back some little way from the street, two being occupied and two empty. </span>
<span sid='33941' title='33941'>The latter looked out with three tiers of vacant melancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that here and there a 'To Let' card had developed like a cataract upon the bleared panes. </span>
<span sid='33942' title='33942'>A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption of sickly plants separated each of these houses from the street, and was traversed by a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and consisting apparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel. </span>
<span sid='33943' title='33943'>The whole place was very sloppy from the rain which had fallen through the night. </span>
<span sid='33944' title='33944'>The garden was bounded by a three-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the top, and against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable, surrounded by a small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and strained their eyes in the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the proceedings within.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33945' title='33945'>I had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the house and plunged into a study of the mystery. </span>
<span sid='33946' title='33946'>Nothing appeared to be further from his intention. </span>
<span sid='33947' title='33947'>With an air of nonchalance which, under the circumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up and down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the opposite houses and the line of railings. </span>
<span sid='33948' title='33948'>Having finished his scrutiny, he proceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the fringe of grass which flanked the path, keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground. </span>
<span sid='33949' title='33949'>Twice he stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter an exclamation of satisfaction. </span>
<span sid='33950' title='33950'>There were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey soil; but since the police had been coming and going over it, I was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it. </span>
<span sid='33951' title='33951'>Still, I had had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his perceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he could see a great deal which was hidden from me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33952' title='33952'>At the door of the house we were met by a tall, white- faced, flaxen-haired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and wrung my companion's hand with effusion. </span>
<span sid='33953' title='33953'>'It is indeed kind of you to come,' he said, 'I have had everything left untouched.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33954' title='33954'>'Except that!' my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. </span>
<span sid='33955' title='33955'>'If a herd of buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess. </span>
<span sid='33956' title='33956'>No doubt, however, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson, before you permitted this.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33957' title='33957'>'I have had so much to do inside the house,' the detective said evasively. </span>
<span sid='33958' title='33958'>'My colleague, Mr Lestrade, is here. </span>
<span sid='33959' title='33959'>I had relied upon him to look after this.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33960' title='33960'>Holmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically. </span>
<span sid='33961' title='33961'>'With two such men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be much for a third party to find out,' he said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33962' title='33962'>Gregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way. </span>
<span sid='33963' title='33963'>'I think we have done all that can be done,' he answered; 'it's a queer case though, and I knew your taste for such things.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33964' title='33964'>'You did not come here in a cab?' asked Sherlock Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33965' title='33965'>'No, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33966' title='33966'>'Nor Lestrade?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33967' title='33967'>'No, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33968' title='33968'>'Then let us go and look at the room.' </span>
<span sid='33969' title='33969'>With which inconsequent remark he strode on into the house, followed by Gregson, whose features expressed his astonishment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33970' title='33970'>A short passage, bare-planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and offices. </span>
<span sid='33971' title='33971'>Two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. </span>
<span sid='33972' title='33972'>One of these had obviously been closed for many weeks. </span>
<span sid='33973' title='33973'>The other belonged to the dining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had occurred. </span>
<span sid='33974' title='33974'>Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that subdued feeling at my heart which the presence of death inspires.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33975' title='33975'>It was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence of all furniture. </span>
<span sid='33976' title='33976'>A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was blotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips had become detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath. </span>
<span sid='33977' title='33977'>Opposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantel-piece of imitation white marble. </span>
<span sid='33978' title='33978'>On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a red wax candle. </span>
<span sid='33979' title='33979'>The solitary window was so dirty that the light was hazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to everything, which was intensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole apartment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33980' title='33980'>All these details I observed afterwards. </span>
<span sid='33981' title='33981'>At present my attention was centred upon the single, grim, motionless figure which lay stretched upon the boards, with vacant, sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured ceiling. </span>
<span sid='33982' title='33982'>It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of age, middle-sized, broad-shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and a short, stubbly beard. </span>
<span sid='33983' title='33983'>He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar and cuffs. </span>
<span sid='33984' title='33984'>A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor beside him. </span>
<span sid='33985' title='33985'>His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while his lower limbs were interlocked, as though his death struggle had been a grievous one. </span>
<span sid='33986' title='33986'>On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror, and, as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human features. </span>
<span sid='33987' title='33987'>This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low forehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw, gave the dead man a singularly simious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his writhing, unnatural posture. </span>
<span sid='33988' title='33988'>I have seen death in many forms, but never has it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark, grimy apartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33989' title='33989'>Lestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway, and greeted my companion and myself.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33990' title='33990'>'This case will make a stir, sir,' he remarked. </span>
<span sid='33991' title='33991'>'It beats anything I have seen, and I am no chicken.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33992' title='33992'>'There is no clue!' said Gregson.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33993' title='33993'>'None at all,' chimed in Lestrade.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33994' title='33994'>Sherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it intently. </span>
<span sid='33995' title='33995'>'You are sure that there is no wound?' he asked, pointing to numerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33996' title='33996'>'Positive!' cried both detectives.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33997' title='33997'>'Then, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual - presumably the murderer, if murder has been committed. </span>
<span sid='33998' title='33998'>It reminds me of the circumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Utrecht&t=h'>Utrecht</a>, in the year '34. </span>
<span sid='33999' title='33999'>Do you remember the case, Gregson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34000' title='34000'>'No, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34001' title='34001'>'Read it up - you really should. </span>
<span sid='34002' title='34002'>There is nothing new under the sun. </span>
<span sid='34003' title='34003'>It has all been done before.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34004' title='34004'>As he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and everywhere, feeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes wore the same faraway expression which I have already remarked upon. </span>
<span sid='34005' title='34005'>So swiftly was the examination made, that one would hardly have guessed the minuteness with which it was conducted. </span>
<span sid='34006' title='34006'>Finally, he sniffed the dead man's lips, and then glanced at the soles of his patent leather boots.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34007' title='34007'>'He has not been moved at all?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34008' title='34008'>'No more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34009' title='34009'>'You can take him to the mortuary now,' he said. </span>
<span sid='34010' title='34010'>'There is nothing more to be learned.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34011' title='34011'>Gregson had a stretcher and four men at hand. </span>
<span sid='34012' title='34012'>At his call they entered the room, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. </span>
<span sid='34013' title='34013'>As they raised him, a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor. </span>
<span sid='34014' title='34014'>Lestrade grabbed it up and stared at it with mystified eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34015' title='34015'>'There's been a woman here,' he cried. </span>
<span sid='34016' title='34016'>'It's a woman's wedding-ring.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34017' title='34017'>He held it out, as he spoke, upon the palm of his hand. </span>
<span sid='34018' title='34018'>We all gathered round him and gazed at it. </span>
<span sid='34019' title='34019'>There could be no doubt that that circlet of plain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34020' title='34020'>'This complicates matters,' said Gregson. </span>
<span sid='34021' title='34021'>'Heaven knows, they were complicated enough before.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34022' title='34022'>'You're sure it doesn't simplify them?' observed Holmes. </span>
<span sid='34023' title='34023'>'There's nothing to be learned by staring at it. </span>
<span sid='34024' title='34024'>What did you find in his pockets?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34025' title='34025'>'We have it all here,' said Gregson, pointing to a litter of objects upon one of the bottom steps of the stairs 'A gold watch, No. 97163, by Barraud, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='34026' title='34026'>Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. </span>
<span sid='34027' title='34027'>Gold ring, with masonic device. </span>
<span sid='34028' title='34028'>Gold pin - bull-dog's head, with rubies as eyes. </span>
<span sid='34029' title='34029'><a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Russia&t=h'>Russia</a>n leather card-case with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Cleveland&t=h'>Cleveland</a>, corresponding with the E. J. D. upon the linen. </span>
<span sid='34030' title='34030'>No purse, but loose money to the extent of seven pounds thirteen. </span>
<span sid='34031' title='34031'>Pocket edition of Boccaccio's Decameron, with name of Joseph Stangerson upon the fly-leaf. </span>
<span sid='34032' title='34032'>Two letters - one addressed to E. J. Drebber and one to Joseph Stangerson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34033' title='34033'>'At what address?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34034' title='34034'>'<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n Exchange, Strand - to be left till called for. </span>
<span sid='34035' title='34035'>They are both from the Guion Steamship Company, and refer to the sailing of their boats from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Liverpool&t=h'>Liverpool</a>. </span>
<span sid='34036' title='34036'>It is clear that this unfortunate man was about to return to New <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=York&t=h'>York</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34037' title='34037'>'Have you made any inquiries as to this man Stangerson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34038' title='34038'>'I did it at once, sir,' said Gregson. </span>
<span sid='34039' title='34039'>'I have had advertisements sent to all the newspapers, and one of my men has gone to the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n Exchange, but he has not returned yet.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34040' title='34040'>'Have you sent to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Cleveland&t=h'>Cleveland</a>?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34041' title='34041'>'We telegraphed this morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34042' title='34042'>'How did you word your inquiries?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34043' title='34043'>'We simply detailed the circumstances, and said that we should be glad of any information which could help us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34044' title='34044'>'You did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to be crucial?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34045' title='34045'>'I asked about Stangerson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34046' title='34046'>'Nothing else? </span>
<span sid='34047' title='34047'>Is there no circumstance on which this whole case appears to hinge? </span>
<span sid='34048' title='34048'>Will you not telegraph again?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34049' title='34049'>'I have said all I have to say,' said Gregson, in an offended voice.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34050' title='34050'>Sherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make some remark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we were holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene, rubbing his hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34051' title='34051'>'Mr Gregson,' he said, 'I have just made a discovery of the highest importance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a careful examination of the walls.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34052' title='34052'>The little man's eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently in a state of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his colleague.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34053' title='34053'>'Come here,' he said, bustling back into the room, the atmosphere of which felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate. </span>
<span sid='34054' title='34054'>'Now, stand there!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34055' title='34055'>He struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34056' title='34056'>'Look at that!' he said, triumphantly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34057' title='34057'>I have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. </span>
<span sid='34058' title='34058'>In this particular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a yellow square of coarse plastering. </span>
<span sid='34059' title='34059'>Across this bare space there was scrawled in blood-red letters a single word-</span>
<p>
<span sid='34060' title='34060'>RACHE</span>
<p>
<span sid='34061' title='34061'>'What do you think of that?' cried the detective, with the air of a showman exhibiting his show. </span>
<span sid='34062' title='34062'>'This was overlooked because it was in the darkest corner of the room, and no one thought of looking there. </span>
<span sid='34063' title='34063'>The murderer has written it with his or her own blood. </span>
<span sid='34064' title='34064'>See this smear where it has trickled down the wall! </span>
<span sid='34065' title='34065'>That disposes of the idea of suicide anyhow. </span>
<span sid='34066' title='34066'>Why was that corner chosen to write it on? </span>
<span sid='34067' title='34067'>I will tell you. </span>
<span sid='34068' title='34068'>See that candle on the mantelpiece. </span>
<span sid='34069' title='34069'>It was lit at the time, and if it was lit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion of the wall.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34070' title='34070'>'And what does it mean now that you have found it?' asked Gregson in a deprecatory voice.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34071' title='34071'>'Mean? </span>
<span sid='34072' title='34072'>Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female name Rachel, but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish. </span>
<span sid='34073' title='34073'>You mark my words, when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a woman named Rachel has something to do with it. </span>
<span sid='34074' title='34074'>It's all very well for you to laugh, Mr Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='34075' title='34075'>You may be very smart and clever, but the old hound is the best, when all is said and done.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34076' title='34076'>'I really beg your pardon!' said my companion, who had ruffled the little man's temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter. </span>
<span sid='34077' title='34077'>'You certainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out and, as you say, it bears every mark of having been written by the other participant in last night's mystery. </span>
<span sid='34078' title='34078'>I have not had time to examine this room yet, but with your permission I shall do so now.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34079' title='34079'>As he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying glass from his pocket. </span>
<span sid='34080' title='34080'>With these two implements he trotted noiselessly about the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once lying flat upon his face. </span>
<span sid='34081' title='34081'>So engrossed was he with his occupation that he appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to himself under his breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire of exclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries suggestive of encouragement and of hope. </span>
<span sid='34082' title='34082'>As I watched him I was irresistibly reminded of a pure-blooded, well-trained foxhound as it dashes backwards and forwards through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes across the lost scent. </span>
<span sid='34083' title='34083'>For twenty minutes or more he continued his researches, measuring with the most exact care the distance between marks which were entirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying his tape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner. </span>
<span sid='34084' title='34084'>In one place he gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the floor, and packed it away in an envelope. </span>
<span sid='34085' title='34085'>Finally he examined with his glass the word upon the wall, going over every letter of it with the most minute exactness. </span>
<span sid='34086' title='34086'>This done, he appeared to be satisfied, for he replaced his tape and his glass in his pocket.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34087' title='34087'>'They say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains; he remarked with a smile. </span>
<span sid='34088' title='34088'>'It's a very bad definition, but it does apply to detective work.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34089' title='34089'>Gregson and Lestrade had watched the manoeuvres of their amateur companion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. </span>
<span sid='34090' title='34090'>They evidently failed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to realize, that Sherlock Holmes's smallest actions were all directed towards some definite and practical end.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34091' title='34091'>'What do you think of it, sir?' they both asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34092' title='34092'>'It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume to help you,' remarked my friend. </span>
<span sid='34093' title='34093'>'You are doing so well now that it would be a pity for anyone to interfere.' </span>
<span sid='34094' title='34094'>There was a world of sarcasm in his voice as he spoke. </span>
<span sid='34095' title='34095'>'If you will let me know how your investigations go,' he continued, 'I shall be happy to give you any help I can. </span>
<span sid='34096' title='34096'>In the meantime I should like to speak to the constable who found the body. </span>
<span sid='34097' title='34097'>Can you give me his name and address?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34098' title='34098'>Lestrade glanced at his note-book. </span>
<span sid='34099' title='34099'>'John Rance,' he said. </span>
<span sid='34100' title='34100'>'He is off duty now. </span>
<span sid='34101' title='34101'>You will find him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park Gate.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34102' title='34102'>Holmes took a note of the address.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34103' title='34103'>'Come along, Doctor,' he said; 'we shall go and look him up. </span>
<span sid='34104' title='34104'>I'll tell you one thing which may help you in the case,' he continued, turning to the two detectives. </span>
<span sid='34105' title='34105'>'There has been murder done, and the murderer was a man. </span>
<span sid='34106' title='34106'>He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had small feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a Trichinopoly cigar. </span>
<span sid='34107' title='34107'>He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab, which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his off fore-leg. </span>
<span sid='34108' title='34108'>In all probability the murderer had a florid face, and the fingernails of his right hand were remarkably long. </span>
<span sid='34109' title='34109'>These are only a few indications, but they may assist you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34110' title='34110'>Lestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34111' title='34111'>'If this man was murdered, how was it done?' asked the former.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34112' title='34112'>'Poison,' said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and strode off. </span>
<span sid='34113' title='34113'>'One other thing, Lestrade,' he added, turning round at the door: '"Rache" is the German for "revenge"; so don't lose your time by looking for Miss Rachel.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34114' title='34114'>With which Parthian shot he walked away, leaving the two rivals open-mouthed behind him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34115' title='34115'>CHAPTER 4: What John Rance Had to Tell</span>
<p>
<span sid='34116' title='34116'>It was one o'clock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. </span>
<span sid='34117' title='34117'>Sherlock Holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a long telegram. </span>
<span sid='34118' title='34118'>He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us to the address given us by Lestrade.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34119' title='34119'>'There is nothing like first-hand evidence,' he remarked; 'as a matter of fact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still we may as well learn all that is to be learned.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34120' title='34120'>'You amaze me, Holmes,' said I. </span>
<span sid='34121' title='34121'>'Surely you are not as sure as you pretend to be of all those particulars which you gave.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34122' title='34122'>'There's no room for mistake,' he answered. </span>
<span sid='34123' title='34123'>The very first thing which I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with its wheels close to the kerb. </span>
<span sid='34124' title='34124'>Now, up to last night, we have had no rain for a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must have been there during the night. </span>
<span sid='34125' title='34125'>There were the marks of the horse's hoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than that of the other three, showing that that was a new shoe. </span>
<span sid='34126' title='34126'>Since the cab was there after the rain began, and was not there at any time during the morning - I have Gregson's word for that - it follows that it must have been there during the night, and, therefore, that it brought those two individuals to the house.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34127' title='34127'>'That seems simple enough,' said I; 'but how about the other man's height?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34128' title='34128'>'Why, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from the length of his stride. </span>
<span sid='34129' title='34129'>It is a simple calculation enough, though there is no use my boring you with figures. </span>
<span sid='34130' title='34130'>I had this fellow's stride both on the clay outside and on the dust within. </span>
<span sid='34131' title='34131'>Then I had a way of checking my calculation. </span>
<span sid='34132' title='34132'>When a man writes on a wall, his instinct leads him to write about the level of his own eyes. </span>
<span sid='34133' title='34133'>Now that writing was just over six feet from the ground. </span>
<span sid='34134' title='34134'>It was child's play.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34135' title='34135'>'And his age?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34136' title='34136'>'Well, if a man can stride four and a half feet without the smallest effort, he can't be quite in the sere and yellow. </span>
<span sid='34137' title='34137'>That was the breadth of a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across. </span>
<span sid='34138' title='34138'>Patent-leather boots had gone round, and Square-toes had hopped over. </span>
<span sid='34139' title='34139'>There is no mystery about it at all. </span>
<span sid='34140' title='34140'>I am simply applying to ordinary life a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which I advocated in that article. </span>
<span sid='34141' title='34141'>Is there anything else that puzzles you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34142' title='34142'>'The finger-nails and the Trichinopoly,' I suggested.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34143' title='34143'>'The writing on the wall was done with a man's fore-finger dipped in blood. </span>
<span sid='34144' title='34144'>My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly scratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the man's nail had been trimmed. </span>
<span sid='34145' title='34145'>I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor. </span>
<span sid='34146' title='34146'>It was dark in colour and flakey - such an ash as is only made by a Trichinopoly. </span>
<span sid='34147' title='34147'>I have made a special study of cigar ashes - in fact, I have written a monograph upon the subject. </span>
<span sid='34148' title='34148'>I flatter myself that I can distinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand either of cigar or of tobacco. </span>
<span sid='34149' title='34149'>It is just in such details that the skilled detective differs from the Gregson and Lestrade type.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34150' title='34150'>And the florid face?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34151' title='34151'>'Ah, that was a more daring shot, though I have no doubt that I was right. </span>
<span sid='34152' title='34152'>You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34153' title='34153'>I passed my hand over my brow. </span>
<span sid='34154' title='34154'>'My head is in a whirl,' I remarked; 'the more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. </span>
<span sid='34155' title='34155'>How came these two men - if there were two men - into an empty house? </span>
<span sid='34156' title='34156'>What has become of the cabman who drove them? </span>
<span sid='34157' title='34157'>How could one man compel another to take poison? </span>
<span sid='34158' title='34158'>Where did the blood come from? </span>
<span sid='34159' title='34159'>What was the object of the murderer, since robbery had no part in it? </span>
<span sid='34160' title='34160'>How came the woman's ring there? </span>
<span sid='34161' title='34161'>Above all, why should the second man write up the German word RACHE before decamping? </span>
<span sid='34162' title='34162'>I confess that I cannot see any possible way of reconciling all these facts.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34163' title='34163'>My companion smiled approvingly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34164' title='34164'>'You sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,' he said. </span>
<span sid='34165' title='34165'>'There is much that is still obscure, though I have quite made up my mind on the main facts. </span>
<span sid='34166' title='34166'>As to poor Lestrade's discovery, it was simply a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track, by suggesting Socialism and secret societies. </span>
<span sid='34167' title='34167'>It was not done by a German. </span>
<span sid='34168' title='34168'>The A, if you noticed, was printed somewhat after the German fashion. </span>
<span sid='34169' title='34169'>Now, a real German invariably prints in the Latin character, so that we may safely say that this was not written by one, but by a clumsy imitator who overdid his part. </span>
<span sid='34170' title='34170'>It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong channel. </span>
<span sid='34171' title='34171'>I'm not going to tell you much more of the case, Doctor. </span>
<span sid='34172' title='34172'>You know a conjurer gets no credit once he has explained his trick; and if I show you too much of my method of working, you will come to the conclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34173' title='34173'>'I shall never do that,' I answered; 'you have brought detection as near an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34174' title='34174'>My companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way in which I uttered them. </span>
<span sid='34175' title='34175'>I had already observed that he was as sensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34176' title='34176'>'I'll tell you one other thing,' he said. </span>
<span sid='34177' title='34177'>'Patent-leathers and Square-toes came in the same cab, and they walked down the pathway together as friendly as possible - arm-in-arm, in all probability. </span>
<span sid='34178' title='34178'>When they got inside, they walked up and down the room - or rather, Patent-leathers stood still while Square-toes walked up and down. </span>
<span sid='34179' title='34179'>I could read all that in the dust; and I could read that as he walked he grew more and more excited. </span>
<span sid='34180' title='34180'>That is shown by the increased length of his strides. </span>
<span sid='34181' title='34181'>He was talking all the while, and working himself up, no doubt, into a fury. </span>
<span sid='34182' title='34182'>Then the tragedy occurred. </span>
<span sid='34183' title='34183'>I've told you all I know myself now, for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. </span>
<span sid='34184' title='34184'>We have a good working basis, however, on which to start. </span>
<span sid='34185' title='34185'>We must hurry up, for I want to go to Halle's concert to hear Norman-Neruda this afternoon.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34186' title='34186'>This conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way through a long succession of dingy streets and dreary byways. </span>
<span sid='34187' title='34187'>In the dingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand. </span>
<span sid='34188' title='34188'>'That's Audley Court in there,' he said, pointing to a narrow slit in the line of dead-coloured brick. </span>
<span sid='34189' title='34189'>'You'll find me here when you come back.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34190' title='34190'>Audley Court was not an attractive locality. </span>
<span sid='34191' title='34191'>The narrow passage led us into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings. </span>
<span sid='34192' title='34192'>We picked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines of discoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of which was decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was engraved. </span>
<span sid='34193' title='34193'>On inquiry we found that the constable was in bed, and we were shown into a little front parlour to await his coming.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34194' title='34194'>He appeared presently, looking a little irritable at being disturbed in his slumbers. </span>
<span sid='34195' title='34195'>'I made my report at the office,' he said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34196' title='34196'>Holmes took a half-sovereign from his pocket and played with it pensively. </span>
<span sid='34197' title='34197'>'We thought that we should like to hear it all from your own lips,' he said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34198' title='34198'>'I shall be most happy to tell you anything I can,' the constable answered, with his eyes upon the little golden disc.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34199' title='34199'>'Just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34200' title='34200'>Rance sat down on the horsehair sofa, and knitted his brows, as though determined not to omit anything in his narrative.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34201' title='34201'>'I'll tell it ye from the beginning,' he said. </span>
<span sid='34202' title='34202'>'My time is from ten at night to six in the morning. </span>
<span sid='34203' title='34203'>At eleven there was a fight at the White Hart; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat. </span>
<span sid='34204' title='34204'>At one o'clock it began to rain, and I met Harry Murcher - him who has the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Holland&t=h'>Holland</a> Grove beat - and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street a-talkin's Presently - maybe about two or a little after - I thought I would take a look round and see that all was right down the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a> Road. </span>
<span sid='34205' title='34205'>It was precious dirty and lonely. </span>
<span sid='34206' title='34206'>Not a soul did I meet all the way down, though a cab or two went past me. </span>
<span sid='34207' title='34207'>I was a-strollin' down, thinkin' between ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be, when suddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same house. </span>
<span sid='34208' title='34208'>Now, I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was empty on account of him that owns them who won't have the drains seed to, though the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o' typhoid fever. </span>
<span sid='34209' title='34209'>I was knocked all in a heap, therefore, at seeing a light in the window, and I suspected as something was wrong. </span>
<span sid='34210' title='34210'>When I got to the door-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34211' title='34211'>'You stopped, and then walked back to the garden gate,' my companion interrupted. </span>
<span sid='34212' title='34212'>'What did you do that for?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34213' title='34213'>Rance gave a violent jump, and stared at Sherlock Holmes with the utmost amazement upon his features.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34214' title='34214'>'Why, that's true, sir,' he said; 'though how you come to know it, Heaven only knows. </span>
<span sid='34215' title='34215'>Ye see when I got up to the door, it was so still and lonesome, that I thought I'd be none the worse for some one with me. </span>
<span sid='34216' title='34216'>I ain't afeard of anything on this side o' the grave, but I thought that maybe it was him that died o' the typhoid inspecting the drains what killed him. </span>
<span sid='34217' title='34217'>The thought gave me a kind o' turn, and I walked back to the gate to see if I could see Murcher's lantern, but there wasn't no sign of him nor of anyone else.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34218' title='34218'>'There was no one in the street?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34219' title='34219'>'Not a livin' soul, sir, nor as much as a dog. </span>
<span sid='34220' title='34220'>Then I pulled myself together and went back and pushed the door open. </span>
<span sid='34221' title='34221'>All was quiet inside, so I went into the room where the light was a-burnin'. </span>
<span sid='34222' title='34222'>There was a candle flickerin' on the mantelpiece - a red wax one - and by its light I saw-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34223' title='34223'>'Yes, I know all that you saw. </span>
<span sid='34224' title='34224'>You walked round the room several times, and you knelt down by the body, and then you walked through and tried the kitchen door, and then-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34225' title='34225'>John Rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in his eyes. </span>
<span sid='34226' title='34226'>'Where was you hid to see all that?' he cried. </span>
<span sid='34227' title='34227'>'It seems to me that you knows a deal more than you should.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34228' title='34228'>Holmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable. </span>
<span sid='34229' title='34229'>'Don't get arresting me for the murder,' he said. </span>
<span sid='34230' title='34230'>'I am one of the hounds and not the wolf; Mr Gregson or Mr Lestrade will answer for that. </span>
<span sid='34231' title='34231'>Go on, though. </span>
<span sid='34232' title='34232'>What did you do next?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34233' title='34233'>Rance resumed his seat, without, however, losing his mystified expression. </span>
<span sid='34234' title='34234'>'I went back to the gate and sounded my whistle That brought Murcher and two more to the spot.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34235' title='34235'>'Was the street empty then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34236' title='34236'>'Well, it was, as far as anybody that could be of any good goes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34237' title='34237'>'What do you mean?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34238' title='34238'>The constable's features broadened into a grin. </span>
<span sid='34239' title='34239'>'I've seen many a drunk chap in my time,' he said, 'but never anyone so cryin' drunk as that cove. </span>
<span sid='34240' title='34240'>He was at the gate when I came out, a-leanin' up ag'in the railings, and a-singin' at the pitch o' his lungs about Columbine's New-fangled Banner, or some such stuff. </span>
<span sid='34241' title='34241'>He couldn't stand, far less help.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34242' title='34242'>'What sort of a man was he?' asked Sherlock Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34243' title='34243'>John Rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression. </span>
<span sid='34244' title='34244'>'He was an uncommon drunk sort o' man,' he said. </span>
<span sid='34245' title='34245'>'He'd ha' found hisself in the station if we hadn't been so took up.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34246' title='34246'>'His face - his dress - didn't you notice them?' </span>
<span sid='34247' title='34247'>Holmes broke in impatiently.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34248' title='34248'>'I should think I did notice them, seeing that I had to prop him up - me and Murcher between us. </span>
<span sid='34249' title='34249'>He was a long chap, with a red face, the lower part muffied round-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34250' title='34250'>'That will do,' cried Holmes. </span>
<span sid='34251' title='34251'>'What became of him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34252' title='34252'>'We'd enough to do without lookin' after him,' the policeman said, in an aggrieved voice. </span>
<span sid='34253' title='34253'>'I'll wager he found his way home all right.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34254' title='34254'>'How was he dressed?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34255' title='34255'>'A brown overcoat.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34256' title='34256'>'Had he a whip in his hand?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34257' title='34257'>'A whip - no.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34258' title='34258'>'He must have left it behind,' muttered my companion. </span>
<span sid='34259' title='34259'>'You didn't happen to see or hear a cab after that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34260' title='34260'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34261' title='34261'>'There's a half-sovereign for you,' my companion said, standing up and taking his hat. </span>
<span sid='34262' title='34262'>'I am afraid, Rance, that you will never rise in the force. </span>
<span sid='34263' title='34263'>That head of yours should be for use as well as ornament. </span>
<span sid='34264' title='34264'>You might have gained your sergeant's stripes last night. </span>
<span sid='34265' title='34265'>The man whom you held in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this mystery, and whom we are seeking. </span>
<span sid='34266' title='34266'>There is no use of arguing about it now; I tell you that it is so. </span>
<span sid='34267' title='34267'>Come along, Doctor.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34268' title='34268'>We started off for the cab together, leaving our informant incredulous, but obviously uncomfortable.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34269' title='34269'>'The blundering fool!' Holmes said, bitterly, as we drove back to our lodgings. </span>
<span sid='34270' title='34270'>Just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of good luck, and not taking advantage of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34271' title='34271'>'I am rather in the dark still. </span>
<span sid='34272' title='34272'>It is true that the description of this man tallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery. </span>
<span sid='34273' title='34273'>But why should he come back to the house after leaving it? </span>
<span sid='34274' title='34274'>That is not the way of criminals.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34275' title='34275'>'The ring, man, the ring that was what he came back for. </span>
<span sid='34276' title='34276'>If we have no other way of catching him, we can always bait our line with the ring. </span>
<span sid='34277' title='34277'>I shall have him, Doctor - I'll lay you two to one that I have him. </span>
<span sid='34278' title='34278'>I must thank you for it all. </span>
<span sid='34279' title='34279'>I might not have gone but for you, and so have missed the finest study I ever came across: a study in scarlet, eh? </span>
<span sid='34280' title='34280'>Why shouldn't we use a little art jargon? </span>
<span sid='34281' title='34281'>There's the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it. </span>
<span sid='34282' title='34282'>And now for lunch, and then for Norman Neruda. </span>
<span sid='34283' title='34283'>Her attack and her bowing are splendid. </span>
<span sid='34284' title='34284'>What's that little thing of Chopin's she plays so magnificently: </span>
<span sid='34285' title='34285'>Tra-la-la-lira-lira-lay.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34286' title='34286'>Leaning back in the cab, this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a lark while I meditated upon the manysidedness of the human mind.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34287' title='34287'>CHAPTER 5: Our Advertisement Brings a Visitor</span>
<p>
<span sid='34288' title='34288'>Our morning's exertions had been too much for my weak health, and I was tired out in the afternoon. </span>
<span sid='34289' title='34289'>After Holmes's departure for the concert, I lay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours' sleep. </span>
<span sid='34290' title='34290'>It was a useless attempt. </span>
<span sid='34291' title='34291'>My mind had been too much excited by all that had occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it. </span>
<span sid='34292' title='34292'>Every time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted, baboon-like countenance of the murdered man. </span>
<span sid='34293' title='34293'>So sinister was the impression which that face had produced upon me that I found it difficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its owner from the world. </span>
<span sid='34294' title='34294'>If ever human features bespoke vice of the most malignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch J. Drebber, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Cleveland&t=h'>Cleveland</a>. </span>
<span sid='34295' title='34295'>Still, I recognized that justice must be done, and that the depravity of the victim was no condonement in the eyes of the law.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34296' title='34296'>The more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion's hypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. </span>
<span sid='34297' title='34297'>I remembered how he had sniffed his lips, and had no doubt that he had detected something which had given rise to the idea. </span>
<span sid='34298' title='34298'>Then, again, if not poison, what had caused the man's death, since there was neither wound nor marks of strangulation? </span>
<span sid='34299' title='34299'>But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay so thickly upon the floor? </span>
<span sid='34300' title='34300'>There were no signs of a struggle, nor had the victim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist. </span>
<span sid='34301' title='34301'>As long as all these questions were unsolved, I felt that sleep would be no easy matter, either for Holmes or myself. </span>
<span sid='34302' title='34302'>His quiet, selfconfident manner convinced me that he had already formed a theory which explained all the facts, though what it was I could not for an instant conjecture.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34303' title='34303'>He was very late in returning - so late that I knew that the concert could not have detained him all the time. </span>
<span sid='34304' title='34304'>Dinner was on the table before he appeared.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34305' title='34305'>'It was magnificent,' he said, as he took his seat. </span>
<span sid='34306' title='34306'>'Do you remember what Darwin says about music? </span>
<span sid='34307' title='34307'>He claims that the power of producing and appreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of speech was arrived at. </span>
<span sid='34308' title='34308'>Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced by it. </span>
<span sid='34309' title='34309'>There are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries when the world was in its childhood.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34310' title='34310'>'That's rather a broad idea,' I remarked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34311' title='34311'>'One's ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret Nature,' he answered. </span>
<span sid='34312' title='34312'>'What's the matter? </span>
<span sid='34313' title='34313'>You're not looking quite yourself. </span>
<span sid='34314' title='34314'>This <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a> Road affair has upset you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34315' title='34315'>'To tell the truth, it has,' I said. </span>
<span sid='34316' title='34316'>'I ought to be more casehardened after my Afghan experiences. </span>
<span sid='34317' title='34317'>I saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Maiwand&t=h'>Maiwand</a> without losing my nerve.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34318' title='34318'>'I can understand. </span>
<span sid='34319' title='34319'>There is a mystery about this which stimulates the imagination; where there is no imagination there is no horror. </span>
<span sid='34320' title='34320'>Have you seen the evening paper?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34321' title='34321'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34322' title='34322'>'It gives a fairly good account of the affair. </span>
<span sid='34323' title='34323'>It does not mention the fact that when the man was raised up a woman's wedding-ring fell upon the floor. </span>
<span sid='34324' title='34324'>It is just as well it does not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34325' title='34325'>'Why?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34326' title='34326'>'Look at this advertisement,' he answered. </span>
<span sid='34327' title='34327'>'I had one sent to every paper this morning immediately after the affair.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34328' title='34328'>He threw the paper across to me and I glanced at the place indicated. </span>
<span sid='34329' title='34329'>It was the first announcement in the 'Found' column. </span>
<span sid='34330' title='34330'>'In <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a> Road, this morning,' it ran, 'a plain gold wedding-ring, found in the roadway between the White Hart Tavern and <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Holland&t=h'>Holland</a> Grove. </span>
<span sid='34331' title='34331'>Apply Dr Watson, 221B, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>, between eight and nine this evening.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34332' title='34332'>'Excuse me using your name,' he said. </span>
<span sid='34333' title='34333'>'If I used my own, some of these dunderheads would recognize it and want to meddle in the affair.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34334' title='34334'>'That is all right,' I answered. </span>
<span sid='34335' title='34335'>'But supposing anyone applies, I have no ring.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34336' title='34336'>'Oh, yes, you have,' said he, handing me one. </span>
<span sid='34337' title='34337'>'This will do very well. </span>
<span sid='34338' title='34338'>It is almost a facsimile.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34339' title='34339'>'And who do you expect will answer this advertisement?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34340' title='34340'>'Why, the man in the brown coat - our florid friend with the square toes. </span>
<span sid='34341' title='34341'>If he does not come himself, he will send an accomplice.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34342' title='34342'>'Would he not consider it as too dangerous?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34343' title='34343'>'Not at all. </span>
<span sid='34344' title='34344'>If my view of the case is correct, and I have every reason to believe that it is, this man would rather risk anything than lose the ring. </span>
<span sid='34345' title='34345'>According to my notion he dropped it while stooping over Drebber's body, and did not miss it at the time. </span>
<span sid='34346' title='34346'>After leaving the house he discovered his loss and hurried back, but found the police already in possession, owing to his own folly in leaving the candle burning. </span>
<span sid='34347' title='34347'>He had to pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions which might have been aroused by his appearance at the gate. </span>
<span sid='34348' title='34348'>Now put yourself in that man's place. </span>
<span sid='34349' title='34349'>On thinking the matter over, it must have occurred to him that it was possible that he had lost the ring in the road after leaving the house. </span>
<span sid='34350' title='34350'>What would he do then? </span>
<span sid='34351' title='34351'>He would eagerly look out for the evening papers in the hope of seeing it among the articles found. </span>
<span sid='34352' title='34352'>His eye, of course, would alight upon this. </span>
<span sid='34353' title='34353'>He would be overjoyed. </span>
<span sid='34354' title='34354'>Why should he fear a trap? </span>
<span sid='34355' title='34355'>There would be no reason in his eyes why the finding of the ring should be connected with the murder. </span>
<span sid='34356' title='34356'>He would come. </span>
<span sid='34357' title='34357'>He will come. </span>
<span sid='34358' title='34358'>You shall see him within an hour.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34359' title='34359'>'And then?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34360' title='34360'>'Oh, you can leave me to deal with him then. </span>
<span sid='34361' title='34361'>Have you any arms?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34362' title='34362'>'I have my old service revolver and a few cartridges.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34363' title='34363'>'You had better clean it and load it. </span>
<span sid='34364' title='34364'>He will be a desperate man; and though I shall take him unawares, it is as well to be ready for anything.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34365' title='34365'>I went to my bed-room and followed his advice. </span>
<span sid='34366' title='34366'>When I returned with the pistol, the table had been cleared, and Holmes was engaged in his favourite occupation of scraping upon his violin.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34367' title='34367'>'The plot thickens,' he said, as I entered; 'I have just had an answer to my <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n telegram. </span>
<span sid='34368' title='34368'>My view of the case is the correct one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34369' title='34369'>'And that is?' I asked eagerly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34370' title='34370'>'My fiddle would be the better for new strings,' he remarked. </span>
<span sid='34371' title='34371'>'Put your pistol in your pocket. </span>
<span sid='34372' title='34372'>When the fellow comes, speak to him in an ordinary way. </span>
<span sid='34373' title='34373'>Leave the rest to me. </span>
<span sid='34374' title='34374'>Don't frighten him by looking at him too hard.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34375' title='34375'>'It is eight o'clock now,' I said, glancing at my watch.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34376' title='34376'>'Yes. </span>
<span sid='34377' title='34377'>He will probably be here in a few minutes. </span>
<span sid='34378' title='34378'>Open the door slightly. </span>
<span sid='34379' title='34379'>That will do. </span>
<span sid='34380' title='34380'>Now put the key on the inside. </span>
<span sid='34381' title='34381'>Thank you! </span>
<span sid='34382' title='34382'>This is a queer old book I picked up at a stall yesterday - De Jure inter Gentes - published in Latin at LiÃ¨ge in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Lowlands&t=h'>the Lowlands</a>, in 1642. </span>
<span sid='34383' title='34383'>Charles's head was still firm on his shoulders when this little brown-backed volume was struck off.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34384' title='34384'>'Who is the printer?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34385' title='34385'>'Philippe de Croy, whoever he may have been. </span>
<span sid='34386' title='34386'>On the flyleaf, in very faded ink, is written "Ex libris Gulielmi Whyte." </span>
<span sid='34387' title='34387'>I wonder who William Whyte was. </span>
<span sid='34388' title='34388'>Some pragmatical seventeenth-century lawyer, I suppose. </span>
<span sid='34389' title='34389'>His writing has a legal twist about it. </span>
<span sid='34390' title='34390'>Here comes our man, I think.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34391' title='34391'>As he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell. </span>
<span sid='34392' title='34392'>Sherlock Holmes rose softly and moved his chair in the direction of the door. </span>
<span sid='34393' title='34393'>We heard the servant pass along the hall, and the sharp click of the latch as she opened it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34394' title='34394'>'Does Dr Watson live here?' asked a clear but rather harsh voice. </span>
<span sid='34395' title='34395'>We could not hear the servant's reply, but the door closed, and someone began to ascend the stairs. </span>
<span sid='34396' title='34396'>The footfall was an uncertain and shuffling one. </span>
<span sid='34397' title='34397'>A look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he listened to it. </span>
<span sid='34398' title='34398'>It came slowly along the passage, and there was a feeble tap at the door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34399' title='34399'>'Come in,' I cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34400' title='34400'>At my summons, instead of the man of violence whom we expected, a very old and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment. </span>
<span sid='34401' title='34401'>She appeared to be dazzled by the sudden blaze of light, and after dropping a curtsey, she stood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket with nervous shaky fingers. </span>
<span sid='34402' title='34402'>I glanced at my companion, and his face had assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all I could do to keep my countenance.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34403' title='34403'>The old crone drew out an evening paper, and pointed at our advertisement. </span>
<span sid='34404' title='34404'>'It's this as has brought me, good gentlemen,' she said, dropping another curtsey; 'a gold wedding-ring in the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a> Road. </span>
<span sid='34405' title='34405'>It belongs to my girl Sally, as was married only this time twelve-month, which her husband is steward aboard a Union boat, and what he'd say if he come 'ome and found her without her ring is more than I can think, he being short enough at the best o' times, but more especially when he has the drink. </span>
<span sid='34406' title='34406'>If it please you, she went to the circus last night along with-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34407' title='34407'>'Is that her ring?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34408' title='34408'>'The Lord be thanked!' cried the old woman; Sally will be a glad woman this night. </span>
<span sid='34409' title='34409'>That's the ring.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34410' title='34410'>'And what may your address be?' I inquired, taking up a pencil.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34411' title='34411'>'13, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Duncan Street&t=h'>Duncan Street</a>, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Houndsditch&t=h'>Houndsditch</a>. </span>
<span sid='34412' title='34412'>A weary way from here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34413' title='34413'>'The <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a> Road does not lie between any circus and <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Houndsditch&t=h'>Houndsditch</a>,' said Sherlock Holmes sharply.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34414' title='34414'>The old woman faced round and looked keenly at him from her little red-rimmed eyes. </span>
<span sid='34415' title='34415'>'The gentleman asked me for my address,' she said. </span>
<span sid='34416' title='34416'>'Sally lives in lodgings at 3, Mayfield Place, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Peckham&t=h'>Peckham</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34417' title='34417'>'And your name is-?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34418' title='34418'>'My name is Sawyer - hers is Dennis, which Tom Dennis married her - and a smart, clean lad, too, as long as he's at sea, and no steward in the company more thought of; but when on shore, what with the women and what with liquor shops-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34419' title='34419'>'Here is your ring, Mrs Sawyer,' I interrupted, in obedience to a sign from my companion; 'it clearly belongs to your daughter, and I am glad to be able to restore it to the rightful owner.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34420' title='34420'>With many mumbled blessings and protestations of gratitude the old crone packed it away in her pocket, and shuffled off down the stairs Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet the moment that she was gone and rushed into his room. </span>
<span sid='34421' title='34421'>He returned in a few seconds enveloped in an ulster and a cravat. </span>
<span sid='34422' title='34422'>'I'll follow her,' he said, hurriedly; 'she must be an accomplice, and will lead me to him. </span>
<span sid='34423' title='34423'>Wait up for me.' </span>
<span sid='34424' title='34424'>The hall door had hardly slammed behind our visitor before Holmes had descended the stair. </span>
<span sid='34425' title='34425'>Looking through the window I could see her walking feebly along the other side, while her pursuer dogged her some little distance behind. </span>
<span sid='34426' title='34426'>'Either his whole theory is incorrect,' I thought to myself, 'or else he will be led now to the heart of the mystery.' </span>
<span sid='34427' title='34427'>There was no need for him to ask me to wait up for him, for I felt that sleep was impossible until I heard the result of his adventure.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34428' title='34428'>It was close upon nine when he set out. </span>
<span sid='34429' title='34429'>I had no idea how long he might be, but I sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages of Henri Murger's Vie de BohÃ¨me. </span>
<span sid='34430' title='34430'>Ten o'clock passed, and I heard the footsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed. </span>
<span sid='34431' title='34431'>Eleven, and the more stately tread of the landlady passed my door, bound for the same destination. </span>
<span sid='34432' title='34432'>It was close upon twelve before I heard the sharp sound of his latch-key. </span>
<span sid='34433' title='34433'>The instant he entered I saw by his face that he had not been successful. </span>
<span sid='34434' title='34434'>Amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for the mastery, until the former suddenly carried the day, and he burst into a hearty laugh.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34435' title='34435'>'I wouldn't have the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>ers know it for the world,' he cried, dropping into his chair; 'I have chaffed them so much that they would never have let me hear the end of it. </span>
<span sid='34436' title='34436'>I can afford to laugh, because I know that I will be even with them in the long run.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34437' title='34437'>'What is it then?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34438' title='34438'>'Oh, I don't mind telling a story against myself. </span>
<span sid='34439' title='34439'>That creature had gone a little way when she began to limp and show every sign of being footsore. </span>
<span sid='34440' title='34440'>Presently she came to a halt, and hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. </span>
<span sid='34441' title='34441'>I managed to be close to her so as to hear the address, but I need not have been so anxious, for she sang it out loud enough to be heard at the other side of the street: </span>
<span sid='34442' title='34442'>"Drive to 13, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Duncan Street&t=h'>Duncan Street</a>, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Houndsditch&t=h'>Houndsditch</a>," she cried. </span>
<span sid='34443' title='34443'>This begins to look genuine, I thought, and having seen her safely inside, I perched myself behind. </span>
<span sid='34444' title='34444'>That's an art which every detective should be an expert at. </span>
<span sid='34445' title='34445'>Well, away we rattled, and never drew rein until we reached the street in question. </span>
<span sid='34446' title='34446'>I hopped off before we came to the door, and strolled down the street in an easy lounging way. </span>
<span sid='34447' title='34447'>I saw the cab pull up. </span>
<span sid='34448' title='34448'>The driver jumped down, and I saw him open the door and stand expectantly. </span>
<span sid='34449' title='34449'>Nothing came out though. </span>
<span sid='34450' title='34450'>When I reached him, he was groping about frantically in the empty cab, and giving vent to the finest assorted collection of oaths that ever I listened to. </span>
<span sid='34451' title='34451'>There was no sign or trace of his passenger, and I fear it will be some time before he gets his fare. </span>
<span sid='34452' title='34452'>On inquiring at Number 13 we found that the house belonged to a respectable paperhanger, named Keswick, and that no one of the name either of Sawyer or Dennis had ever been heard of there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34453' title='34453'>'You don't mean to say,' I cried, in amazement, 'that that tottering, feeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion, without either you or the driver seeing her?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34454' title='34454'>'Old woman be damned!' said Sherlock Holmes, sharply. </span>
<span sid='34455' title='34455'>'We were the old women to be so taken in. </span>
<span sid='34456' title='34456'>It must have been a young man, and an active one, too, besides being an incomparable actor. </span>
<span sid='34457' title='34457'>The get-up was inimitable. </span>
<span sid='34458' title='34458'>He saw that he was followed, no doubt, and used this means of giving me the slip. </span>
<span sid='34459' title='34459'>It shows that the man we are after is not as lonely as I imagined he was, but has friends who are ready to risk something for him. </span>
<span sid='34460' title='34460'>Now, Doctor, you are looking done-up. </span>
<span sid='34461' title='34461'>Take my advice and turn in.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34462' title='34462'>I was certainly feeling very weary, so I obeyed his injunction. </span>
<span sid='34463' title='34463'>I left Holmes seated in front of the smouldering fire, and long into the watches of the night I heard the low, melancholy wailings of his violin, and knew that he was still pondering over the strange problem which he had set himself to unravel.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34464' title='34464'>CHAPTER 6: Tobias Gregson Shows What He Can Do</span>
<p>
<span sid='34465' title='34465'>The papers next day were full of the '<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a> Mystery', as they termed it. </span>
<span sid='34466' title='34466'>Each had a long account of the affair, and some had leaders upon it in addition. </span>
<span sid='34467' title='34467'>There was some information in them which was new to me. </span>
<span sid='34468' title='34468'>I still retain in my scrap-book numerous clippings and extracts bearing upon the case. </span>
<span sid='34469' title='34469'>Here is a condensation of a few of them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34470' title='34470'>The Daily Telegraph remarked that in the history of crime there had seldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. </span>
<span sid='34471' title='34471'>The German name of the victim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinister inscription on the wall, all pointed to its perpetration by political refugees and revolutionists. </span>
<span sid='34472' title='34472'>The Socialists had many branches in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>, and the deceased had, no doubt, infringed their unwritten laws, and been tracked down by them. </span>
<span sid='34473' title='34473'>After alluding airily to the Vehmgericht, aqua tofana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers, the Darwinian theory, the principles of Malthus, and the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ratcliff Highway&t=h'>Ratcliff Highway</a> murders, the article concluded by admonishing the Government and advocating a closer watch over foreigners in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34474' title='34474'>The Standard commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the sort usually occurred under a Liberal Administration. </span>
<span sid='34475' title='34475'>They arose from the unsettling of the minds of the masses, and the consequent weakening of all authority. </span>
<span sid='34476' title='34476'>The deceased was an <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n gentleman who had been residing for some weeks in the Metropolis. </span>
<span sid='34477' title='34477'>He had stayed at the boarding-house of Madame Charpentier, in Torquay Terrace, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Camberwell&t=h'>Camberwell</a>. </span>
<span sid='34478' title='34478'>He was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary, Mr Joseph Stangerson. </span>
<span sid='34479' title='34479'>The two bade adieu to their landlady upon Tuesday, the 4th inst., and departed to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Euston Station&t=h'>Euston Station</a> with the avowed intention of catching the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Liverpool&t=h'>Liverpool</a> express. </span>
<span sid='34480' title='34480'>They were afterwards seen together upon the platform. </span>
<span sid='34481' title='34481'>Nothing more is known of them until Mr Drebber's body was, as recorded, discovered in an empty house in the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a> Road, many miles from Euston. </span>
<span sid='34482' title='34482'>How he came there, or how he met his fate, are questions which are still involved in mystery. </span>
<span sid='34483' title='34483'>Nothing is known of the whereabouts of Stangerson. </span>
<span sid='34484' title='34484'>We are glad to learn that Mr Lestrade and Mr Gregson, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>, are both engaged upon the case, and it is confidently anticipated that these well-known officers will speedily throw light upon the matter.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34485' title='34485'>The Daily News observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being a political one. </span>
<span sid='34486' title='34486'>The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which animated <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Continent&t=h'>the Continent</a>al Governments had had the effect of driving to our shores a number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they not soured by the recollection of all that they had undergone. </span>
<span sid='34487' title='34487'>Among these men there was a stringent code of honour, any infringement of which was punished by death. </span>
<span sid='34488' title='34488'>Every effort should be made to find the secretary, Stangerson, and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of the deceased. </span>
<span sid='34489' title='34489'>A great step had been gained by the discovery of the address of the house at which he had boarded - a result which was entirely due to the acuteness and energy of Mr Gregson of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34490' title='34490'>Sherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast, and they appeared to afford him considerable amusement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34491' title='34491'>'I told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade and Gregson would be sure to score.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34492' title='34492'>'That depends on how it turns out.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34493' title='34493'>'Oh, bless you, it doesn't matter in the least. </span>
<span sid='34494' title='34494'>If the man is caught, it will be on account of their exertions; if he escapes, it will be in spite of their exertions. </span>
<span sid='34495' title='34495'>It's heads I win and tails you lose. </span>
<span sid='34496' title='34496'>Whatever they do, they will have followers. </span>
<span sid='34497' title='34497'>"Un sot trouve toujours un plus sot qui l'admire."'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34498' title='34498'>'What on earth is that?' I cried, for at this moment there came the pattering of many steps in the hall and on the stairs, accompanied by audible expressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34499' title='34499'>'It's the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> division of the detective police force; said my companion gravely; and as he spoke there rushed into the room half a dozen of the dirtiest and most ragged street Arabs that ever I clapped eyes on.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34500' title='34500'>' 'Tention!' cried Holmes, in a sharp tone, and the six dirty little scoundrels stood in a line like so many disreputable statuettes. </span>
<span sid='34501' title='34501'>'In future you shall send up Wiggins alone to report, and the rest of you must wait in the street. </span>
<span sid='34502' title='34502'>Have you found it, Wiggins?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34503' title='34503'>'No, sir, we hain't,' said one of the youths.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34504' title='34504'>'I hardly expected you would. </span>
<span sid='34505' title='34505'>You must keep on until you do. </span>
<span sid='34506' title='34506'>Here are your wages.' </span>
<span sid='34507' title='34507'>He handed each of them a shilling. </span>
<span sid='34508' title='34508'>'Now, off you go, and come back with a better report next time.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34509' title='34509'>He waved his hand, and they scampered away downstairs like so many rats, and we heard their shrill voices next moment in the street.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34510' title='34510'>'There's more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than out of a dozen of the force,' Holmes remarked. </span>
<span sid='34511' title='34511'>'The mere sight of an official-looking person seals men's lips. </span>
<span sid='34512' title='34512'>These youngsters, however, go everywhere, and hear everything. </span>
<span sid='34513' title='34513'>They are as sharp as needles, too; all they want is organization.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34514' title='34514'>'Is it on this <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a> case that you are employing them?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34515' title='34515'>'Yes; there is a point which I wish to ascertain. </span>
<span sid='34516' title='34516'>It is merely a matter of time. </span>
<span sid='34517' title='34517'>Hullo! we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance! </span>
<span sid='34518' title='34518'>Here is Gregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon every feature of his face. </span>
<span sid='34519' title='34519'>Bound for us, I know. </span>
<span sid='34520' title='34520'>Yes, he is stopping. </span>
<span sid='34521' title='34521'>There he is!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34522' title='34522'>There was a violent peal at the bell, and in a few seconds the fair-haired detective came up the stairs, three steps at a time, and burst into our sitting-room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34523' title='34523'>'My dear fellow,' he cried, wringing Holmes's unresponsive hand, 'congratulate me! </span>
<span sid='34524' title='34524'>I have made the whole thing as clear as day.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34525' title='34525'>A shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion's expressive face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34526' title='34526'>'Do you mean that you are on the right track?' he asked. </span>
<span sid='34527' title='34527'>'The right track! </span>
<span sid='34528' title='34528'>Why, sir, we have the man under lock and key.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34529' title='34529'>'And his name is?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34530' title='34530'>'Arthur Charpentier, sub-lieutenant in Her Majesty's Navy,' cried Gregson pompously, rubbing his fat hands and inflating his chest.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34531' title='34531'>Sherlock Holmes gave a sigh of relief and relaxed into a smile.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34532' title='34532'>'Take a seat, and try one of these cigars,' he said. </span>
<span sid='34533' title='34533'>'We are anxious to know how you managed it. </span>
<span sid='34534' title='34534'>Will you have some whiskey and water?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34535' title='34535'>'I don't mind if I do; the detective answered. </span>
<span sid='34536' title='34536'>The tremendous exertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have worn me out. </span>
<span sid='34537' title='34537'>Not so much bodily exertion, you understand, as the strain upon the mind. </span>
<span sid='34538' title='34538'>You will appreciate that, Mr Sherlock Holmes, for we are both brain-workers.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34539' title='34539'>'You do me too much honour,' said Holmes gravely. </span>
<span sid='34540' title='34540'>'Let us hear how you arrived at this most gratifying result.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34541' title='34541'>The detective seated himself in the arm-chair, and puffed complacently at his cigar. </span>
<span sid='34542' title='34542'>Then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm of amusement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34543' title='34543'>'The fun of it is,' he cried, 'that that fool Lestrade, who thinks himself so smart, has gone off upon the wrong track altogether. </span>
<span sid='34544' title='34544'>He is after the secretary Stangerson, who had no more to do with the crime than the babe unborn. </span>
<span sid='34545' title='34545'>I have no doubt that he has caught him by this time.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34546' title='34546'>The idea tickled Gregson so much that he laughed until he choked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34547' title='34547'>'And how did you get your clue?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34548' title='34548'>'Ah, tell you all about it. </span>
<span sid='34549' title='34549'>Of course, Doctor Watson, this is strictly between ourselves. </span>
<span sid='34550' title='34550'>The first difficulty which we had to contend with was the finding of this <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n's antecedents. </span>
<span sid='34551' title='34551'>Some people would have waited until their advertisements were answered, or until parties came forward and volunteered information. </span>
<span sid='34552' title='34552'>That is not Tobias Gregson's way of going to work. </span>
<span sid='34553' title='34553'>You remember the hat beside the dead man?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34554' title='34554'>'Yes; said Holmes; 'by John Underwood and Sons, 129, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Camberwell&t=h'>Camberwell</a> Road.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34555' title='34555'>Gregson looked quite crestfallen.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34556' title='34556'>'I had no idea that you noticed that,' he said. </span>
<span sid='34557' title='34557'>'Have you been there?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34558' title='34558'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34559' title='34559'>'Ha!' cried Gregson, in a relieved voice; 'you should never neglect a chance, however small it may seem.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34560' title='34560'>'To a great mind, nothing is little; remarked Holmes, sententiously.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34561' title='34561'>'Well, I went to Underwood, and asked him if he had sold a hat of that size and description. </span>
<span sid='34562' title='34562'>He looked over his books, and came on it at once. </span>
<span sid='34563' title='34563'>He had sent the hat to a Mr Drebber, residing at Charpentier's Boarding Establishment, Torquay Terrace. </span>
<span sid='34564' title='34564'>Thus I got his address.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34565' title='34565'>'Smart - very smart!' murmured Sherlock Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34566' title='34566'>'I next called upon Madame Charpentier,' continued the detective. </span>
<span sid='34567' title='34567'>'I found her very pale and distressed. </span>
<span sid='34568' title='34568'>Her daughter was in the room, too - an uncommonly fine girl she is, too; she was looking red about the eyes and her lips trembled as I spoke to her. </span>
<span sid='34569' title='34569'>That didn't escape my notice. </span>
<span sid='34570' title='34570'>I began to smell a rat. </span>
<span sid='34571' title='34571'>You know that feeling, Mr Sherlock Holmes, when you come upon the right scent - a kind of thrill in your nerves. </span>
<span sid='34572' title='34572'>"Have you heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder Mr Enoch J. Drebber, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Cleveland&t=h'>Cleveland</a>?" I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34573' title='34573'>'The mother nodded. </span>
<span sid='34574' title='34574'>She didn't seem able to get out a word. </span>
<span sid='34575' title='34575'>The daughter burst into tears. </span>
<span sid='34576' title='34576'>I felt more than ever that these people knew something of the matter.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34577' title='34577'>'"At what o'clock did Mr Drebber leave your house for the train?" I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34578' title='34578'>'"At eight o'clock," she said, gulping in her throat to keep down her agitation. </span>
<span sid='34579' title='34579'>"His secretary, Mr Stangerson, said that there were two trains - one at 9.15 and one at 11. </span>
<span sid='34580' title='34580'>He was to catch the first."</span>
<p>
<span sid='34581' title='34581'>'"And was that the last which you saw of him?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='34582' title='34582'>'A terrible change came over the woman's face as I asked the question. </span>
<span sid='34583' title='34583'>Her features turned perfectly livid. </span>
<span sid='34584' title='34584'>It was some seconds before she could get out the single word "Yes" - and when it did come it was in a husky, unnatural tone.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34585' title='34585'>'There was a silence for a moment, and then the daughter spoke in a calm, clear voice.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34586' title='34586'>'"No good can ever come of falsehood, mother," she said. </span>
<span sid='34587' title='34587'>"Let us be frank with this gentleman. </span>
<span sid='34588' title='34588'>We did see Mr Drebber again."</span>
<p>
<span sid='34589' title='34589'>'"God forgive you!" cried Madame Charpentier, throwing up her hands, and sinking back in her chair. </span>
<span sid='34590' title='34590'>"You have murdered your brother."</span>
<p>
<span sid='34591' title='34591'>'"Arthur would rather that we spoke the truth," the girl answered firmly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34592' title='34592'>'"You had best tell me all about it now," I said. </span>
<span sid='34593' title='34593'>"Halfconfidences are worse than none. </span>
<span sid='34594' title='34594'>Besides, you do not know how much we know of it."</span>
<p>
<span sid='34595' title='34595'>'"On your head be it, Alice!" cried her mother; and then, turning to me: </span>
<span sid='34596' title='34596'>"I will tell you all, sir. </span>
<span sid='34597' title='34597'>Do not imagine that my agitation on behalf of my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in this terrible affair. </span>
<span sid='34598' title='34598'>He is utterly innocent of it. </span>
<span sid='34599' title='34599'>My dread is, however, that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to be compromised. </span>
<span sid='34600' title='34600'>That, however, is surely impossible. </span>
<span sid='34601' title='34601'>His high character, his profession, his antecedents would all forbid it."</span>
<p>
<span sid='34602' title='34602'>'"Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts," I answered. </span>
<span sid='34603' title='34603'>"Depend upon it, if your son is innocent he will be none the worse."</span>
<p>
<span sid='34604' title='34604'>'"Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together," she said, and her daughter withdrew. </span>
<span sid='34605' title='34605'>"Now, sir," she continued, "I had no intention of telling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I have no alternative. </span>
<span sid='34606' title='34606'>Having once decided to speak, I will tell you all without omitting any particular."</span>
<p>
<span sid='34607' title='34607'>'"It is your wisest course," said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34608' title='34608'>'"Mr Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks. </span>
<span sid='34609' title='34609'>He and his secretary, Mr Stangerson, had been travelling on <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Continent&t=h'>the Continent</a>. </span>
<span sid='34610' title='34610'>I noticed a '<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Copenhagen&t=h'>Copenhagen</a>' label upon each of their trunks, showing that that had been their last stopping place. </span>
<span sid='34611' title='34611'>Stangerson was a quiet, reserved man, but his employer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise. </span>
<span sid='34612' title='34612'>He was coarse in his habits and brutish in his ways. </span>
<span sid='34613' title='34613'>The very night of his arrival he became very much the worse for drink, and, indeed, after twelve o'clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be sober. </span>
<span sid='34614' title='34614'>His manners towards the maid-servants were disgustingly free and familiar. </span>
<span sid='34615' title='34615'>Worst of all, he speedily assumed the same attitude towards my daughter Alice, and spoke to her more than once in a way which, fortunately, she is too innocent to understand. </span>
<span sid='34616' title='34616'>On one occasion he actually seized her in his arms and embraced her - an outrage which caused his own secretary to reproach him for his unmanly conduct."</span>
<p>
<span sid='34617' title='34617'>'"But why did you stand all this?" I asked. </span>
<span sid='34618' title='34618'>"I suppose that you can get rid of your boarders when you wish."</span>
<p>
<span sid='34619' title='34619'>'Madame Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question. </span>
<span sid='34620' title='34620'>"Would to God that I had given him notice on the very day that he came," she said. </span>
<span sid='34621' title='34621'>"But it was a sore temptation. </span>
<span sid='34622' title='34622'>They were paying a pound a day each - fourteen pounds a week, and this is the slack season. </span>
<span sid='34623' title='34623'>I am a widow, and my boy in the Navy has cost me much. </span>
<span sid='34624' title='34624'>I grudged to lose the money. </span>
<span sid='34625' title='34625'>I acted for the best. </span>
<span sid='34626' title='34626'>This last was too much, however, and I gave him notice to leave on account of it. </span>
<span sid='34627' title='34627'>That was the reason of his going."</span>
<p>
<span sid='34628' title='34628'>'"Well?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='34629' title='34629'>'"My heart grew light when I saw him drive away. </span>
<span sid='34630' title='34630'>My son is on leave just now, but I did not tell him anything of all this, for his temper is violent, and he is passionately fond of his sister. </span>
<span sid='34631' title='34631'>When I closed the door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind. </span>
<span sid='34632' title='34632'>Alas, in less than an hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned that Mr Drebber had returned. </span>
<span sid='34633' title='34633'>He was much excited, and evidently the worse for drink. </span>
<span sid='34634' title='34634'>He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting with my daughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed the train. </span>
<span sid='34635' title='34635'>He then turned to Alice, and before my very face proposed to her that she should fly with him. </span>
<span sid='34636' title='34636'>'You are of age,' he said, 'and there is no law to stop you. </span>
<span sid='34637' title='34637'>I have money enough and to spare. </span>
<span sid='34638' title='34638'>Never mind the old girl here, but come along with me now straight away. </span>
<span sid='34639' title='34639'>You shall live like a princess.' </span>
<span sid='34640' title='34640'>Poor Alice was so frightened that she shrunk away from him, but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her towards the door. </span>
<span sid='34641' title='34641'>I screamed, and at that moment my son Arthur came into the room. </span>
<span sid='34642' title='34642'>What happened then I do not know. </span>
<span sid='34643' title='34643'>I heard oaths and the confused sounds of a scuffle. </span>
<span sid='34644' title='34644'>I was too terrified to raise my head. </span>
<span sid='34645' title='34645'>When I did look up I saw Arthur standing in the doorway laughing, with a stick in his hand. </span>
<span sid='34646' title='34646'>'I don't think that fine fellow will trouble us again,' he said. </span>
<span sid='34647' title='34647'>'I will just go after him and see what he does with himself.' </span>
<span sid='34648' title='34648'>With those words he took his hat and started off down the street. </span>
<span sid='34649' title='34649'>The next morning we heard of Mr Drebber's mysterious death."</span>
<p>
<span sid='34650' title='34650'>'This statement came from Madame Charpentier's lips with many gasps and pauses. </span>
<span sid='34651' title='34651'>At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the words. </span>
<span sid='34652' title='34652'>I made shorthand notes of all that she said, however, so that there should be no possibility of a mistake.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34653' title='34653'>'It's quite exciting,' said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn. </span>
<span sid='34654' title='34654'>'What happened next?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34655' title='34655'>'When Madame Charpentier paused,' the detective continued, 'I saw that the whole case hung upon one point. </span>
<span sid='34656' title='34656'>Fixing her with my eye in a way which I always found effective with women, I asked her at what hour her son returned.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34657' title='34657'>'"I do not know," she answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34658' title='34658'>'"Not know?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='34659' title='34659'>'"No; he has a latch-key, and he let himself in." </span>
<span sid='34660' title='34660'>"After you went to bed?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='34661' title='34661'>'"Yes."</span>
<p>
<span sid='34662' title='34662'>'"When did you go to bed?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='34663' title='34663'>'"About eleven."</span>
<p>
<span sid='34664' title='34664'>'"So your son was gone at least two hours?" </span>
<span sid='34665' title='34665'>"Yes."</span>
<p>
<span sid='34666' title='34666'>'"Possibly four or five?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='34667' title='34667'>'"Yes."</span>
<p>
<span sid='34668' title='34668'>'"What was he doing during that time?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='34669' title='34669'>'"I do not know," she answered, turning white to her very lips.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34670' title='34670'>'Of course after that there was nothing more to be done. </span>
<span sid='34671' title='34671'>I found out where Lieutenant Charpentier was, took two officers with me, and arrested him. </span>
<span sid='34672' title='34672'>When I touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come quietly with us, he answered us as bold as brass: "I suppose you are arresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel Drebber," he said. </span>
<span sid='34673' title='34673'>We had said nothing to him about it, so that his alluding to it had a most suspicious aspect.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34674' title='34674'>'Very,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34675' title='34675'>'He still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as having with him when he followed Drebber. </span>
<span sid='34676' title='34676'>It was a stout oak cudgel.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34677' title='34677'>'What is your theory, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34678' title='34678'>'Well, my theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a> Road. </span>
<span sid='34679' title='34679'>When there, a fresh altercation arose between them, in the course of which Drebber received a blow from the stick, in the pit of the stomach perhaps, which killed him without leaving any mark. </span>
<span sid='34680' title='34680'>The night was so wet that no one was about, so Charpentier dragged the body of his victim into the empty house. </span>
<span sid='34681' title='34681'>As to the candle, and the blood, and the writing on the wall, and the ring, they may all be so many tricks to throw the police on to the wrong scent.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34682' title='34682'>'Well done!' said Holmes in an encouraging voice. </span>
<span sid='34683' title='34683'>'Really, Gregson, you are getting along. </span>
<span sid='34684' title='34684'>We shall make something of you yet.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34685' title='34685'>'I flatter myself that I have managed it rather neatly,' the detective answered proudly. </span>
<span sid='34686' title='34686'>'The young man volunteered a statement, in which he said that after following Drebber some time, the latter perceived him, and took a cab in order to get away from him. </span>
<span sid='34687' title='34687'>On his way home he met an old shipmate, and took a long walk with him. </span>
<span sid='34688' title='34688'>On being asked where this old shipmate lived, he was unable to give any satisfactory reply. </span>
<span sid='34689' title='34689'>I think the whole case fits together uncommonly well. </span>
<span sid='34690' title='34690'>What amuses me is to think of Lestrade, who had started off upon the wrong scent. </span>
<span sid='34691' title='34691'>I am afraid he won't make much of it. </span>
<span sid='34692' title='34692'>Why, by Jove, here's the very man himself!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34693' title='34693'>It was indeed Lestrade, who had ascended the stairs while we were talking, and who now entered the room. </span>
<span sid='34694' title='34694'>The assurance and jauntiness which generally marked his demeanour and dress were, however, wanting. </span>
<span sid='34695' title='34695'>His face was disturbed and troubled, while his clothes were disarranged and untidy. </span>
<span sid='34696' title='34696'>He had evidently come with the intention of consulting with Sherlock Holmes, for on perceiving his colleague he appeared to be embarrassed and put out. </span>
<span sid='34697' title='34697'>He stood in the centre of the room, fumbling nervously with his hat and uncertain what to do. </span>
<span sid='34698' title='34698'>This is a most extraordinary case,' he said at last - 'a most incomprehensible affair.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34699' title='34699'>'Ah, you find it so, Mr Lestrade!' cried Gregson, triumphantly. </span>
<span sid='34700' title='34700'>'I thought you would come to that conclusion. </span>
<span sid='34701' title='34701'>Have you managed to find the secretary, Mr Joseph Stangerson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34702' title='34702'>'The secretary, Mr Joseph Stangerson,' said Lestrade gravely, 'was murdered at Halliday's Private Hotel about six o'clock this morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34703' title='34703'>CHAPTER 7: Light in the Darkness</span>
<p>
<span sid='34704' title='34704'>The intelligence with which Lestrade greeted us was so momentous and so unexpected that we were all three fairly dumbfounded. </span>
<span sid='34705' title='34705'>Gregson sprang out of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water. </span>
<span sid='34706' title='34706'>I stared in silence at Sherlock Holmes, whose lips were compressed and his brows drawn down over his eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34707' title='34707'>Stangerson too!' he muttered. </span>
<span sid='34708' title='34708'>'The plot thickens.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34709' title='34709'>'It was quite thick enough before,' grumbled Lestrade, taking a chair. </span>
<span sid='34710' title='34710'>'I seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34711' title='34711'>'Are you - are you sure of this piece of intelligence?' stammered Gregson.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34712' title='34712'>'I have just come from his room,' said Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='34713' title='34713'>'I was the first to discover what had occurred.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34714' title='34714'>'We have been hearing Gregson's view of the matter,' Holmes observed. </span>
<span sid='34715' title='34715'>'Would you mind letting us know what you have seen and done?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34716' title='34716'>'I have no objection,' Lestrade answered, seating himself. </span>
<span sid='34717' title='34717'>'I freely confess that I was of the opinion that Stangerson was concerned in the death of Drebber. </span>
<span sid='34718' title='34718'>This fresh development has shown me that I was completely mistaken. </span>
<span sid='34719' title='34719'>Full of the one idea, I set myself to find out what had become of the secretary. </span>
<span sid='34720' title='34720'>They had been seen together at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Euston Station&t=h'>Euston Station</a> about half-past eight on the evening of the third. </span>
<span sid='34721' title='34721'>At two in the morning Drebber had been found in the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a> Road. </span>
<span sid='34722' title='34722'>The question which confronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed between 8.30 and the time of the crime, and what had become of him afterwards. </span>
<span sid='34723' title='34723'>I telegraphed to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Liverpool&t=h'>Liverpool</a>, giving a description of the man, and warning them to keep a watch upon the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n boats. </span>
<span sid='34724' title='34724'>I then set to work calling upon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the vicinity of Euston. </span>
<span sid='34725' title='34725'>You see, I argued that if Drebber and his companion had become separated, the natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in the vicinity for the night, and then to hang about the station again next morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34726' title='34726'>'They would be likely to agree on some meeting-place beforehand,' remarked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34727' title='34727'>'So it proved. </span>
<span sid='34728' title='34728'>I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making inquiries entirely without avail. </span>
<span sid='34729' title='34729'>This morning I began very early, and at eight o'clock I reached Halliday's Private Hotel, in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Little George Street&t=h'>Little George Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='34730' title='34730'>On my inquiry as to whether a Mr Stangerson was living there, they at once answered me in the affirmative.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34731' title='34731'>'"No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting," they said. </span>
<span sid='34732' title='34732'>"He has been waiting for a gentleman for two days."</span>
<p>
<span sid='34733' title='34733'>'"Where is he now?" I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34734' title='34734'>'"He is upstairs in bed. </span>
<span sid='34735' title='34735'>He wished to be called at nine." </span>
<span sid='34736' title='34736'>"I will go up and see him at once," I said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34737' title='34737'>'It seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and lead him to say something unguarded. </span>
<span sid='34738' title='34738'>The Boots volunteered to show me the room: it was on the second floor, and there was a small corridor leading up to it. </span>
<span sid='34739' title='34739'>The Boots pointed out the door to me, and was about to go downstairs again when I saw something that made me feel sickish, in spite of my twenty years' experience. </span>
<span sid='34740' title='34740'>From under the door there curled a little red ribbon of blood, which had meandered across the passage and formed a little pool along the skirting at the other side. </span>
<span sid='34741' title='34741'>I gave a cry, which brought the Boots back. </span>
<span sid='34742' title='34742'>He nearly fainted when he saw it. </span>
<span sid='34743' title='34743'>The door was locked on the inside, but we put our shoulders to it, and knocked it in. </span>
<span sid='34744' title='34744'>The window of the room was open, and beside the window all huddled up, lay the body of a man in his nightdress. </span>
<span sid='34745' title='34745'>He was quite dead, and had been for some time, for his limbs were rigid and cold. </span>
<span sid='34746' title='34746'>When we turned him over, the Boots recognized him at once as being the same gentleman who had engaged the room under the name of Joseph Stangerson. </span>
<span sid='34747' title='34747'>The cause of death was a deep stab in the left side, which must have penetrated the heart. </span>
<span sid='34748' title='34748'>And now comes the strangest part of the affair. </span>
<span sid='34749' title='34749'>What do you suppose was above the murdered man?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34750' title='34750'>I felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror, even before Sherlock Holmes answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34751' title='34751'>'The word RACHE, written in letters of blood,' he said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34752' title='34752'>'That was it,' said Lestrade, in an awe-struck voice; and we were all silent for a while.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34753' title='34753'>There was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the deeds of this unknown assassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to his crimes. </span>
<span sid='34754' title='34754'>My nerves, which were steady enough on the field of battle, tingled as I thought of it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34755' title='34755'>'The man was seen,' continued Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='34756' title='34756'>'A milk boy, passing on his way to the dairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews at the back of the hotel. </span>
<span sid='34757' title='34757'>He noticed that a ladder, which usually lay there, was raised against one of the windows of the second floor, which was wide open. </span>
<span sid='34758' title='34758'>After passing, he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder. </span>
<span sid='34759' title='34759'>He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel. </span>
<span sid='34760' title='34760'>He took no particular notice of him, beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him to be at work. </span>
<span sid='34761' title='34761'>He has an impression that the man was tall, had a reddish face, and was dressed in a long, brownish coat. </span>
<span sid='34762' title='34762'>He must have stayed in the room some little time after the murder, for we found blood-stained water in the basin, where he had washed his hands, and marks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34763' title='34763'>I glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer which tallied so exactly with his own. </span>
<span sid='34764' title='34764'>There was, however, no trace of exultation or satisfaction upon his face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34765' title='34765'>'Did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the murderer?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34766' title='34766'>'Nothing. </span>
<span sid='34767' title='34767'>Stangerson had Drebber's purse in his pocket, but it seems that this was usual, as he did all the paying. </span>
<span sid='34768' title='34768'>There was eighty-odd pounds in it, but nothing had been taken. </span>
<span sid='34769' title='34769'>Whatever the motives of these extraordinary crimes, robbery is certainly not one of them. </span>
<span sid='34770' title='34770'>There were no papers or memoranda in the murdered man's pocket, except a single telegram, dated from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Cleveland&t=h'>Cleveland</a> about a month ago, and containing the words, 'J. H. is in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>." </span>
<span sid='34771' title='34771'>There was no name appended to this message.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34772' title='34772'>'And there was nothing else?' Holmes asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34773' title='34773'>'Nothing of any importance The man's novel, with which he had read himself to sleep, was lying upon the bed, and his pipe was on a chair beside him. </span>
<span sid='34774' title='34774'>There was a glass of water on the table, and on the window-sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34775' title='34775'>Sherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34776' title='34776'>The last link,' he cried, exultantly. </span>
<span sid='34777' title='34777'>'My case is complete.' </span>
<span sid='34778' title='34778'>The two detectives stared at him in amazement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34779' title='34779'>'I have now in my hands,' my companion said, confidently, 'all the threads which have formed such a tangle.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34780' title='34780'>There are, of course, details to be filled in, but I am as certain of all the main facts, from the time that Drebber parted from Stangerson at the station, up to the discovery of the body of the latter, as if I had seen them with my own eyes. </span>
<span sid='34781' title='34781'>I will give you a proof of my knowledge. </span>
<span sid='34782' title='34782'>Could you lay your hand upon those pills?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34783' title='34783'>'I have them,' said Lestrade, producing a small white box; 'I took them and the purse and the telegram, intending to have them put in a place of safety at the Police Station. </span>
<span sid='34784' title='34784'>It was the merest chance my taking these pills, for I am bound to say I do not attach any importance to them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34785' title='34785'>'Give them here,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='34786' title='34786'>'Now, Doctor,' turning to me, 'are those ordinary pills?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34787' title='34787'>They certainly were not. </span>
<span sid='34788' title='34788'>They were of a pearly grey colour, small, round, and almost transparent against the light. </span>
<span sid='34789' title='34789'>'From their lightness and transparency, I should imagine that they are soluble in water,' I remarked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34790' title='34790'>'Precisely so,' answered Holmes. </span>
<span sid='34791' title='34791'>'Now would you mind going down and fetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so long, and which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain yesterday.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34792' title='34792'>I went downstairs and carried the dog upstairs in my arms. </span>
<span sid='34793' title='34793'>Its laboured breathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end. </span>
<span sid='34794' title='34794'>Indeed, its snow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded the usual term of canine existence. </span>
<span sid='34795' title='34795'>I placed it upon a cushion on the rug.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34796' title='34796'>'I will now cut one of these pills in two,' said Holmes, and drawing his penknife he suited the action to the word. </span>
<span sid='34797' title='34797'>'One half we return into the box for future purposes. </span>
<span sid='34798' title='34798'>The other half I will place in this wine-glass, in which is a teaspoonful of water. </span>
<span sid='34799' title='34799'>You perceive that our friend, the Doctor, is right, and that it readily dissolves.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34800' title='34800'>This may be very interesting,' said Lestrade, in the injured tone of one who suspects that he is being laughed at; 'I cannot see, however, what it has to do with the death of Mr Joseph Stangerson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34801' title='34801'>'Patience, my friend, patience! </span>
<span sid='34802' title='34802'>You will find in time that it has everything to do with it. </span>
<span sid='34803' title='34803'>I shall now add a little milk to make the mixture palatable, and on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps it up readily enough.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34804' title='34804'>As he spoke he turned the contents of the wine-glass into a saucer and placed it in front of the terrier, who speedily licked it dry. </span>
<span sid='34805' title='34805'>Sherlock Holmes's earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in silence, watching the animal intently, and expecting some startling effect. </span>
<span sid='34806' title='34806'>None such appeared, however. </span>
<span sid='34807' title='34807'>The dog continued to lie stretched upon the cushion, breathing in a laboured way but apparently neither the better nor the worse for its draught.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34808' title='34808'>Holmes had taken out his watch, and as minute followed minute without result, an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared upon his features. </span>
<span sid='34809' title='34809'>He gnawed his lip, drummed his fingers upon the table, and showed every other symptom of acute impatience. </span>
<span sid='34810' title='34810'>So great was his emotion that I felt sincerely sorry for him, while the two detectives smiled derisively, by no means displeased at this check which he had met.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34811' title='34811'>'It can't be a coincidence,' he cried, at last springing from his chair and pacing wildly up and down the room; 'it is impossible that it should be a mere coincidence. </span>
<span sid='34812' title='34812'>The very pills which I suspected in the case of Drebber are actually found after the death of Stangerson. </span>
<span sid='34813' title='34813'>And yet they are inert. </span>
<span sid='34814' title='34814'>What can it mean? </span>
<span sid='34815' title='34815'>Surely my whole chain of reasoning cannot have been false. </span>
<span sid='34816' title='34816'>It is impossible! </span>
<span sid='34817' title='34817'>And yet this wretched dog is none the worse. </span>
<span sid='34818' title='34818'>Ah, I have it! </span>
<span sid='34819' title='34819'>I have it!' </span>
<span sid='34820' title='34820'>With a perfect shriek of delight he rushed to the box, cut the other pill in two, dissolved it, added milk, and presented it to the terrier. </span>
<span sid='34821' title='34821'>The unfortunate creature's tongue seemed hardly to have been moistened in it before it gave a convulsive shiver in every limb, and lay as rigid and lifeless as if it had been struck by lightning.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34822' title='34822'>Sherlock Holmes drew a long breath, and wiped the perspiration from his forehead. </span>
<span sid='34823' title='34823'>'I should have more faith,' he said; 'I ought to know by this time that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of deductions, it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other interpretation. </span>
<span sid='34824' title='34824'>Of the two pills in the box, one was of the most deadly poison, and the other was entirely harmless. </span>
<span sid='34825' title='34825'>I ought to have known that before ever I saw the box at all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34826' title='34826'>This last statement appeared to me to be so startling that I could hardly believe that he was in his sober senses. </span>
<span sid='34827' title='34827'>There was the dead dog, however, to prove that his conjecture had been correct. </span>
<span sid='34828' title='34828'>It seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away, and I began to have a dim, vague perception of the truth.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34829' title='34829'>'All this seems strange to you,' continued Holmes, 'because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which was presented to you. </span>
<span sid='34830' title='34830'>I had the good fortune to seize upon that, and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the logical sequence of it. </span>
<span sid='34831' title='34831'>Hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more obscure have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions. </span>
<span sid='34832' title='34832'>It is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. </span>
<span sid='34833' title='34833'>The most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious, because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn. </span>
<span sid='34834' title='34834'>This murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those outrÃ© and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable. </span>
<span sid='34835' title='34835'>These strange details, far from making the case more difficult, have really had the effect of making it less so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34836' title='34836'>Mr Gregson, who had listened to this address with considerable impatience, could contain himself no longer. </span>
<span sid='34837' title='34837'>'Look here, Mr Sherlock Holmes,' he said, 'we are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart man, and that you have your own methods of working. </span>
<span sid='34838' title='34838'>We want something more than mere theory and preaching now, though. </span>
<span sid='34839' title='34839'>It is a case of taking the man. </span>
<span sid='34840' title='34840'>I have made my case out, and it seems I was wrong. </span>
<span sid='34841' title='34841'>Young Charpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair. </span>
<span sid='34842' title='34842'>Lestrade went after his man, Stangerson, and it appears that he was wrong too. </span>
<span sid='34843' title='34843'>You have thrown out hints here, and hints there, and seem to know more than we do, but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to ask you straight how much you do know of the business. </span>
<span sid='34844' title='34844'>Can you name the man who did it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34845' title='34845'>'I cannot help feeling that Gregson is right, sir,' remarked Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='34846' title='34846'>'We have both tried, and we have both failed. </span>
<span sid='34847' title='34847'>You have remarked more than once since I have been in the room that you had all the evidence which you require. </span>
<span sid='34848' title='34848'>Surely you will not withhold it any longer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34849' title='34849'>'Any delay in arresting the assassin,' I observed, 'might give him time to perpetrate some fresh atrocity.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34850' title='34850'>Thus pressed by us all, Holmes showed signs of irresolution. </span>
<span sid='34851' title='34851'>He continued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest and his brows drawn down, as was his habit when lost in thought.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34852' title='34852'>'There will be no more murders,' he said at last, stopping abruptly and facing us. </span>
<span sid='34853' title='34853'>'You can put that consideration out of the question. </span>
<span sid='34854' title='34854'>You have asked me if I know the name of the assassin. </span>
<span sid='34855' title='34855'>I do. </span>
<span sid='34856' title='34856'>The mere knowing of his name is a small thing, however, compared with the power of laying our hands upon him. </span>
<span sid='34857' title='34857'>This I expect very shortly to do. </span>
<span sid='34858' title='34858'>I have good hopes of managing it through my own arrangements; but it is a thing which needs delicate handling, for we have a shrewd and desperate man to deal with, who is supported, as I have had occasion to prove, by another who is as clever as himself. </span>
<span sid='34859' title='34859'>As long as this man has no idea that anyone can have a clue there is some chance of securing him; but if he had the slightest suspicion, he would change his name, and vanish in an instant among the four million inhabitants of this great city. </span>
<span sid='34860' title='34860'>Without meaning to hurt either of your feelings, I am bound to say that I consider these men to be more than a match for the official force, and that is why I have not asked your assistance. </span>
<span sid='34861' title='34861'>If I fail, I shall, of course, incur all the blame due to this omission; but that I am prepared for. </span>
<span sid='34862' title='34862'>At present I am ready to promise that the instant that I can communicate with you without endangering my own combinations, I shall do so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34863' title='34863'>Gregson and Lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this assurance, or by the depreciating allusion to the detective police. </span>
<span sid='34864' title='34864'>The former had flushed up to the roots of his flaxen hair, while the other's beady eyes glistened with curiosity and resentment. </span>
<span sid='34865' title='34865'>Neither of them had time to speak, however, before there was a tap at the door, and the spokesman of the street Arabs, young Wiggins, introduced his insignificant and unsavoury person.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34866' title='34866'>'Please, sir,' he said, touching his forelock, 'I have the cab downstairs.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34867' title='34867'>'Good boy,' said Holmes, blandly. </span>
<span sid='34868' title='34868'>'Why don't you introduce this pattern at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>?' he continued, taking a pair of steel handcuffs from a drawer. </span>
<span sid='34869' title='34869'>'See how beautifully the spring works. </span>
<span sid='34870' title='34870'>They fasten in an instant!</span>
<p>
<span sid='34871' title='34871'>'The old pattern is good enough,' remarked Lestrade, 'if we can only find the man to put them on.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34872' title='34872'>'Very good, very good,' said Holmes, smiling. </span>
<span sid='34873' title='34873'>'The cabman may as well help me with my boxes. </span>
<span sid='34874' title='34874'>Just ask him to step up, Wiggins.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34875' title='34875'>I was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about to set out on a journey, since he had not said anything to me about it. </span>
<span sid='34876' title='34876'>There was a small portmanteau in the room, and this he pulled out and began to strap. </span>
<span sid='34877' title='34877'>He was busily engaged at it when the cabman entered the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34878' title='34878'>'Just give me a help with this buckle, cabman,' he said, kneeling over his task, and never turning his head.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34879' title='34879'>The fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen, defiant air and put down his hands to assist. </span>
<span sid='34880' title='34880'>At that instant there was a sharp click, the jangling of metal, and Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet again.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34881' title='34881'>'Gentlemen; he cried, with flashing eyes, get me introduce you to Mr Jefferson Hope, the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph Stangerson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34882' title='34882'>The whole thing occurred in a moment - so quickly that I had no time to realize it. </span>
<span sid='34883' title='34883'>I have a vivid recollection of that instant, of Holmes's triumphant expression and the ring of his voice, of the cabman's dazed, savage face, as he glared at the glittering handcuffs, which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists. </span>
<span sid='34884' title='34884'>For a second or two we might have been a group of statues. </span>
<span sid='34885' title='34885'>Then with an inarticulate roar of fury, the prisoner wrenched himself free from Holmes's grasp, and hurled himself through the window. </span>
<span sid='34886' title='34886'>Woodwork and glass gave way before him; but before he got quite through, Gregson, Lestrade, and Holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds. </span>
<span sid='34887' title='34887'>He was dragged back into the room, and then commenced a terrific conflict. </span>
<span sid='34888' title='34888'>So powerful and so fierce was he that the four of us were shaken off again and again. </span>
<span sid='34889' title='34889'>He appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit. </span>
<span sid='34890' title='34890'>His face and hands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass, but loss of blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance. </span>
<span sid='34891' title='34891'>It was not until Lestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and half-strangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of no avail; and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his feet as well as his hands. </span>
<span sid='34892' title='34892'>That done, we rose to our feet breathless and panting.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34893' title='34893'>'We have his cab,' said Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='34894' title='34894'>'It will serve to take him to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>. </span>
<span sid='34895' title='34895'>And now, gentlemen,' he continued, with a pleasant smile, 'we have reached the end of our little mystery. </span>
<span sid='34896' title='34896'>You are very welcome to put any questions that you like to me now, and there is no danger that I will refuse to answer them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34897' title='34897'>Part 2: The Country of the Saints</span>
<p>
<span sid='34898' title='34898'>CHAPTER 1: On the Great Alkali Plain</span>
<p>
<span sid='34899' title='34899'>In the central portion of the great North <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n Continent there lies an arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served as a barrier against the advance of civilization. </span>
<span sid='34900' title='34900'>From the Sierra <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Nevada&t=h'>Nevada</a> to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Nebraska&t=h'>Nebraska</a>, and from the Yellow-stone River in the north to the Colorado upon the south, is a region of desolation and silence. </span>
<span sid='34901' title='34901'>Nor is Nature always in one mood throughout this grim district. </span>
<span sid='34902' title='34902'>It comprises snow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy valleys. </span>
<span sid='34903' title='34903'>There are swift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged caÃ±ons; and there are enormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer are grey with the saline alkali dust. </span>
<span sid='34904' title='34904'>They all preserve, however, the common characteristics of barrenness, inhospitality, and misery.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34905' title='34905'>There are no inhabitants of this land of despair. </span>
<span sid='34906' title='34906'>A band of Pawnees or of Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other hunting-grounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight of those awesome plains, and to find themselves once more upon their prairies. </span>
<span sid='34907' title='34907'>The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps heavily through the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark ravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks. </span>
<span sid='34908' title='34908'>These are the sole dwellers in the wilderness.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34909' title='34909'>In the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern slope of the Sierra Blanco. </span>
<span sid='34910' title='34910'>As far as the eye can reach stretches the great flat plain-land, all dusted over with patches of alkali, and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chapparal bushes. </span>
<span sid='34911' title='34911'>On the extreme verge of the horizon lies a long chain of mountain peaks, with their rugged summits flecked with snow. </span>
<span sid='34912' title='34912'>In this great stretch of country there is no sign of life, nor of anything appertaining to life. </span>
<span sid='34913' title='34913'>There is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no movement upon the dull, grey earth - above all, there is absolute silence. </span>
<span sid='34914' title='34914'>Listen as one may, there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness; nothing but silence - complete and heart-subduing silence.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34915' title='34915'>It has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain. </span>
<span sid='34916' title='34916'>That is hardly true. </span>
<span sid='34917' title='34917'>Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one sees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance. </span>
<span sid='34918' title='34918'>It is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many adventurers. </span>
<span sid='34919' title='34919'>Here and there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali. </span>
<span sid='34920' title='34920'>Approach, and examine them! </span>
<span sid='34921' title='34921'>They are bones: some large and coarse, others smaller and more delicate. </span>
<span sid='34922' title='34922'>The former have belonged to oxen, and the latter to men. </span>
<span sid='34923' title='34923'>For fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34924' title='34924'>Looking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May, eighteen hundred and forty-seven, a solitary traveller. </span>
<span sid='34925' title='34925'>His appearance was such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region. </span>
<span sid='34926' title='34926'>An observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty. </span>
<span sid='34927' title='34927'>His face was lean and haggard, and the brown parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones; his long, brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white; his eyes were sunken in his head, and burned with an unnatural lustre; while the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton. </span>
<span sid='34928' title='34928'>As he stood, he leaned upon his weapon for support, and yet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiry and vigorous constitution. </span>
<span sid='34929' title='34929'>His gaunt face, however, and his clothes, which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs, proclaimed what it was that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance. </span>
<span sid='34930' title='34930'>The man was dying - dying from hunger and from thirst.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34931' title='34931'>He had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this little elevation, in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water. </span>
<span sid='34932' title='34932'>Now the great salt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of savage mountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which might indicate the presence of moisture. </span>
<span sid='34933' title='34933'>In all that broad landscape there was no gleam of hope. </span>
<span sid='34934' title='34934'>North, and east, and west he looked with wild, questioning eyes, and then he realized that his wanderings had come to an end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to die. </span>
<span sid='34935' title='34935'>'Why not here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence,' he muttered, as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34936' title='34936'>Before sitting down, he had deposited upon the ground his useless rifle, and also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl, which he had carried slung over his right shoulder. </span>
<span sid='34937' title='34937'>It appeared to be somewhat too heavy for his strength, for in lowering it, it came down on the ground with some little violence. </span>
<span sid='34938' title='34938'>Instantly there broke from the grey parcel a little moaning cry, and from it there protruded a small, scared face, with very bright brown eyes, and two little speckled dimpled fists.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34939' title='34939'>'You've hurt me!' said a childish voice, reproachfully.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34940' title='34940'>'Have I though, the man answered penitently; 'I didn't go for to do it.' </span>
<span sid='34941' title='34941'>As he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty little girl of about five years of age, whose dainty shoes and smart pink frock with its little linen apron all bespoke a mother's care. </span>
<span sid='34942' title='34942'>The child was pale and wan, but her healthy arms and legs showed that she had suffered less than her companion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34943' title='34943'>'How is it now?' he answered anxiously, for she was still rubbing the towsy golden curls which covered the back of her head.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34944' title='34944'>'Kiss it and make it well,' she said, with perfect gravity, showing the injured part to him. </span>
<span sid='34945' title='34945'>'That's what mother used to do. </span>
<span sid='34946' title='34946'>Where's mother?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34947' title='34947'>'Mother's gone. </span>
<span sid='34948' title='34948'>I guess you'll see her before long.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34949' title='34949'>'Gone, eh!' said the little girl. </span>
<span sid='34950' title='34950'>'Funny, she didn't say goodbye; she 'most always did if she was just goin' over to auntie's for tea, and now she's been away three days. </span>
<span sid='34951' title='34951'>Say, it's awful dry, ain't it? </span>
<span sid='34952' title='34952'>Ain't there no water nor nothing to eat?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34953' title='34953'>'No, there ain't nothing, dearie. </span>
<span sid='34954' title='34954'>You'll just need to be patient awhile, and then you'll be all right. </span>
<span sid='34955' title='34955'>Put your head up agin' me like that, and then you'll feel bullier. </span>
<span sid='34956' title='34956'>It ain't easy to talk when your lips is like leather, but I guess I'd best let you know how the cards lie. </span>
<span sid='34957' title='34957'>What's that you've got?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34958' title='34958'>Pretty things! fine things!' cried the little girl enthusiastically, holding up two glittering fragments of mica. </span>
<span sid='34959' title='34959'>'When we goes back to home - give them to brother Bob.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34960' title='34960'>'You'll see prettier things than them soon,' said the man confidently. </span>
<span sid='34961' title='34961'>'You just wait a bit. </span>
<span sid='34962' title='34962'>I was going to tell you though - you remember when we left the river?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34963' title='34963'>'Oh, yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34964' title='34964'>'Well, we reckoned we'd strike another river soon, d'ye see. </span>
<span sid='34965' title='34965'>But there was somethin' wrong; compasses, or map, or somethin', and it didn't turn up. </span>
<span sid='34966' title='34966'>Water ran out. </span>
<span sid='34967' title='34967'>Just except a little drop for the likes of you and - and -'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34968' title='34968'>'And you couldn't wash yourself,' interrupted his companion gravely, staring up at his grimy visage.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34969' title='34969'>'No, nor drink. </span>
<span sid='34970' title='34970'>And Mr Bender, he was the fust to go, and then Indian Pete, and then Mrs McGregor, and then Johnny Hones, and then dearie, your mother.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34971' title='34971'>'Then mother's a deader too,' cried the little girl, dropping her face in her pinafore and sobbing bitterly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34972' title='34972'>'Yes, they all went except you and me. </span>
<span sid='34973' title='34973'>Then I thought there was some chance of water in this direction, so I heaved you over my shoulder and we tramped it together. </span>
<span sid='34974' title='34974'>It don't seem as though we've improved matters. </span>
<span sid='34975' title='34975'>There's an almighty small chance for us now!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34976' title='34976'>'Do you mean that we are going to die too?' asked the child, checking her sobs, and raising her tear-stained face. </span>
<span sid='34977' title='34977'>'I guess that's about the size of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34978' title='34978'>'Why didn't you say so before?' she said, laughing gleefully. </span>
<span sid='34979' title='34979'>'You gave me such a fright. </span>
<span sid='34980' title='34980'>Why, of course, now as long as we die we'll be with mother again.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34981' title='34981'>'Yes, you will, dearie.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34982' title='34982'>'And you too. </span>
<span sid='34983' title='34983'>I'll tell her how awful good you've been. </span>
<span sid='34984' title='34984'>I'll bet she meets us at the door of heaven with a big pitcher of water, and a lot of buckwheat cakes, hot, and toasted on both sides, like Bob and me was fond of. </span>
<span sid='34985' title='34985'>How long will it be first?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34986' title='34986'>'I don't know - not very long.' </span>
<span sid='34987' title='34987'>The man's eyes were fixed upon the northern horizon. </span>
<span sid='34988' title='34988'>In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared three little specks which increased in size every moment, so rapidly did they approach. </span>
<span sid='34989' title='34989'>They speedily resolved themselves into three large birds, which circled over the heads of the two wanderers, and then settled upon some rocks which overlooked them. </span>
<span sid='34990' title='34990'>They were buzzards, the vultures of the west, whose coming is the forerunner of death.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34991' title='34991'>'Cocks and hens,' cried the little girl gleefully, pointing at their ill-omened forms, and clapping her hands to make them rise. </span>
<span sid='34992' title='34992'>Say, did God make this country?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34993' title='34993'>'In course He did,' said her companion, rather startled by this unexpected question.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34994' title='34994'>'He made the country down in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Illinois&t=h'>Illinois</a>, and He made the Missouri,' the little girl continued. </span>
<span sid='34995' title='34995'>'I guess somebody else made the country in these parts. </span>
<span sid='34996' title='34996'>It's not nearly so well done. </span>
<span sid='34997' title='34997'>They forgot the water and the trees.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='34998' title='34998'>'What would ye think of offering up prayer?' the man asked diffidently.</span>
<p>
<span sid='34999' title='34999'>'It ain't night yet,' she answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35000' title='35000'>'It don't matter. </span>
<span sid='35001' title='35001'>It ain't quite regular, but He won't mind that, you bet. </span>
<span sid='35002' title='35002'>You say over them ones that you used to say every night in the waggon when we was on the Plains.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35003' title='35003'>'Why don't you say some yourself?' the child asked, with wondering eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35004' title='35004'>'I disremember them,' he answered. </span>
<span sid='35005' title='35005'>'I hain't said none since I was half the height o'that gun. </span>
<span sid='35006' title='35006'>I guess it's never too late. </span>
<span sid='35007' title='35007'>You say them out, and I'll stand by and come in on the choruses.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35008' title='35008'>'Then you'll need to kneel down, and me too,' she said, laying the shawl out for that purpose. </span>
<span sid='35009' title='35009'>'You've got to put your hands up like this It makes you feel kind of good.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35010' title='35010'>It was a strange sight, had there been anything but the buzzards to see it. </span>
<span sid='35011' title='35011'>Side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers, the little prattling child and the reckless, hardened adventurer. </span>
<span sid='35012' title='35012'>Her chubby face and his haggard, angular visage were both turned up to the cloudless heaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread Being with whom they were face to face, while the two voices - the one thin and clear, the other deep and harsh - united in the entreaty for mercy and forgiveness. </span>
<span sid='35013' title='35013'>The prayer finished, they resumed their seat in the shadow of the boulder until the child fell asleep, nestling upon the broad breast of her protector. </span>
<span sid='35014' title='35014'>He watched over her slumber for some time, but Nature proved to be too strong for him. </span>
<span sid='35015' title='35015'>For three days and three nights he had allowed himself neither rest nor repose. </span>
<span sid='35016' title='35016'>Slowly the eyelids drooped over the tired eyes, and the head sunk lower and lower upon the breast, until the man's grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses of his companion, and both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35017' title='35017'>Had the wanderer remained awake for another half-hour a strange sight would have met his eyes. </span>
<span sid='35018' title='35018'>Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali plain there rose up a little spray of dust, very slight at first, and hardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance, but gradually growing higher and broader until it formed a solid, well-defined cloud. </span>
<span sid='35019' title='35019'>This cloud continued to increase in size until it became evident that it could only be raised by a great multitude of moving creatures. </span>
<span sid='35020' title='35020'>In more fertile spots the observer would have come to the conclusion that one of those great herds of bisons which graze upon the prairie land was approaching him. </span>
<span sid='35021' title='35021'>This was obviously impossible in these arid wilds. </span>
<span sid='35022' title='35022'>As the whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary bluff upon which the two castaways were reposing, the canvas-covered tilts of waggons and the figures of armed horsemen began to show up through the haze, and the apparition revealed itself as being a great caravan upon its journey for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the West&t=h'>the West</a>. </span>
<span sid='35023' title='35023'>But what a caravan! </span>
<span sid='35024' title='35024'>When the head of it had reached the base of the mountains, the rear was not yet visible on the horizon. </span>
<span sid='35025' title='35025'>Right across the enormous plain stretched the straggling array, waggons and carts, men on horseback, and men on foot. </span>
<span sid='35026' title='35026'>Innumerable women who staggered along under burdens, and children who toddled beside the waggons or peeped out from under the white coverings. </span>
<span sid='35027' title='35027'>This was evidently no ordinary party of immigrants, but rather some nomad people who had been compelled from stress of circumstances to seek themselves a new country. </span>
<span sid='35028' title='35028'>There rose through the clear air a confused clattering and rumbling from this great mass of humanity, with the creaking of wheels and the neighing of horses. </span>
<span sid='35029' title='35029'>Loud as it was, it was not sufficient to rouse the two tired wayfarers above them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35030' title='35030'>At the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave, iron-faced men, clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles. </span>
<span sid='35031' title='35031'>On reaching the base of the bluff they halted, and held a short council among themselves.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35032' title='35032'>'The wells are to the right, my brothers,' said one, a hard-lipped, clean-shaven man with grizzly hair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35033' title='35033'>To the right of the Sierra Blanco - so we shall reach the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Rio Grande&t=h'>Rio Grande</a>,' said another.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35034' title='35034'>'Fear not for water,' cried a third. </span>
<span sid='35035' title='35035'>'He who could draw it from the rocks will not now abandon His chosen people.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35036' title='35036'>'Amen! amen!' responded the whole party.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35037' title='35037'>They were about to resume their journey when one of the youngest and keenest-eyed uttered an exclamation and pointed up at the rugged crag above them. </span>
<span sid='35038' title='35038'>From its summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink, showing up hard and bright against the grey rocks behind. </span>
<span sid='35039' title='35039'>At the sight there was a general reining up of horses and unslinging of guns, while fresh horsemen came galloping up to reinforce the vanguard. </span>
<span sid='35040' title='35040'>The word 'Redskins' was on every lip.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35041' title='35041'>'There can't be any number of Injuns here,' said the elderly man who appeared to be in command. </span>
<span sid='35042' title='35042'>'We have passed the Pawnees, and there are no other tribes until we cross the great mountains.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35043' title='35043'>'Shall I go forward and see, Brother Stangerson,' asked one of the band.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35044' title='35044'>'And I,' 'And I,' cried a dozen voices.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35045' title='35045'>'Leave your horses below and we will await you here,' the Elder answered. </span>
<span sid='35046' title='35046'>In a moment the young fellows had dismounted, fastened their horses, and were ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the object which had excited their curiosity. </span>
<span sid='35047' title='35047'>They advanced rapidly and noiselessly, with the confidence and dexterity of practised scouts. </span>
<span sid='35048' title='35048'>The watchers from the plain below could see them flit from rock to rock until their figures stood out against the skyline. </span>
<span sid='35049' title='35049'>The young man who had first given the alarm was leading them. </span>
<span sid='35050' title='35050'>Suddenly his followers saw him throw up his hands, as though overcome with astonishment, and on joining him they were affected in the same way by the sight which met their eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35051' title='35051'>On the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a single giant boulder, and against this boulder there lay a tall man, long-bearded and hard-featured, but of an excessive thinness. </span>
<span sid='35052' title='35052'>His placid face and regular breathing showed that he was fast asleep. </span>
<span sid='35053' title='35053'>Beside him lay a little child, with her round white arms encircling his brown sinewy neck, and her golden-haired head resting upon the breast of his velveteen tunic. </span>
<span sid='35054' title='35054'>Her rosy lips were parted, showing the regular line of snow-white teeth within, and a playful smile played over her infantile features. </span>
<span sid='35055' title='35055'>Her plump little white legs, terminating in white socks and neat shoes with shining buckles, offered a strange contrast to the long shrivelled members of her companion. </span>
<span sid='35056' title='35056'>On the ledge of rock above this strange couple there stood three solemn buzzards, who, at the sight of the new comers, uttered raucous screams of disappointment and flapped sullenly away.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35057' title='35057'>The cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers, who stared about them in bewilderment. </span>
<span sid='35058' title='35058'>The man staggered to his feet and looked down upon the plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him, and which was now traversed by this enormous body of men and of beasts. </span>
<span sid='35059' title='35059'>His face assumed an expression of incredulity as he gazed, and he passed his bony hand over his eyes. </span>
<span sid='35060' title='35060'>'This is what they call delirium, I guess,' he muttered. </span>
<span sid='35061' title='35061'>The child stood beside him, holding on to the skirt of his coat, and said nothing, but looked all around her with the wondering, questioning gaze of childhood.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35062' title='35062'>The rescuing party were speedily able to convince the two castaways that their appearance was no delusion. </span>
<span sid='35063' title='35063'>One of them seized the little girl and hoisted her upon his shoulder, while two others supported her gaunt companion, and assisted him towards the wagons.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35064' title='35064'>'My name is John Ferrier,' the wanderer explained; 'me and that little un are all that's left o' twenty-one people. </span>
<span sid='35065' title='35065'>The rest is all dead o' thirst and hunger away down in the south.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35066' title='35066'>'Is she your child?' asked someone.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35067' title='35067'>'I guess she is now,' the other cried, defiantly; 'she's mine 'cause I saved her. </span>
<span sid='35068' title='35068'>No man will take her from me. </span>
<span sid='35069' title='35069'>She's Lucy Ferrier from this day on. </span>
<span sid='35070' title='35070'>Who are you though?' he continued, glancing with curiosity at his stalwart, sunburned rescuers; 'there seems to be a powerful lot of ye.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35071' title='35071'>'Nigh upon ten thousand,' said one of the young men; 'we are the persecuted children of God - the chosen of the Angel Merona.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35072' title='35072'>'I never heard tell on him,' said the wanderer. </span>
<span sid='35073' title='35073'>'He appears to have chosen a fair crowd of ye.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35074' title='35074'>'Do not jest at that which is sacred,' said the other sternly. </span>
<span sid='35075' title='35075'>'We are of those who believe in those sacred writings, drawn in Egyptian letters on plates of beaten gold, which were handed unto the holy Joseph Smith at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Palmyra&t=h'>Palmyra</a>. </span>
<span sid='35076' title='35076'>We have come from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Nauvoo&t=h'>Nauvoo</a>, in the State of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Illinois&t=h'>Illinois</a>, where we had founded our temple. </span>
<span sid='35077' title='35077'>We have come to seek a refuge from the violent man and from the godless, even though it be the heart of the desert.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35078' title='35078'>The name of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Nauvoo&t=h'>Nauvoo</a> evidently recalled recollections to John Ferrier. </span>
<span sid='35079' title='35079'>'I see,' he said, 'you are the Mormons!</span>
<p>
<span sid='35080' title='35080'>'We are the Mormons,' answered his companions with one voice.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35081' title='35081'>'And where are you going?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35082' title='35082'>'We do not know. </span>
<span sid='35083' title='35083'>The hand of God is leading us under the person of our Prophet. </span>
<span sid='35084' title='35084'>You must come before him. </span>
<span sid='35085' title='35085'>He shall say what is to be done with you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35086' title='35086'>They had reached the base of the hill by this time, and were surrounded by crowds of the pilgrims - pale-faced, meek-looking women; strong, laughing children; and anxious earnest-eyed men. </span>
<span sid='35087' title='35087'>Many were the cries of astonishment and of commiseration which arose from them when they perceived the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution of the other. </span>
<span sid='35088' title='35088'>Their escort did not halt, however, but pushed on, followed by a great crowd of Mormons, until they reached a waggon, which was conspicuous for its great size and for the gaudiness and smartness of its appearance. </span>
<span sid='35089' title='35089'>Six horses were yoked to it, whereas the others were furnished with two, or, at most, four a-piece. </span>
<span sid='35090' title='35090'>Beside the driver there sat a man who could not have been more than thirty years of age, but whose massive head and resolute expression marked him as leader. </span>
<span sid='35091' title='35091'>He was reading a brown-backed volume, but as the crowd approached he laid it aside, and listened attentively to an account of the episode. </span>
<span sid='35092' title='35092'>Then he turned to the two castaways.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35093' title='35093'>'If we take you with us,' he said, in solemn words, 'it can only be as believers in our own creed. </span>
<span sid='35094' title='35094'>We shall have no wolves in our fold. </span>
<span sid='35095' title='35095'>Better far that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you should prove to be that little speck of decay which in time corrupts the whole fruit. </span>
<span sid='35096' title='35096'>Will you come with us on these terms?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35097' title='35097'>'Guess come with you on any terms,' said Ferrier, with such emphasis that the grave Elders could not restrain a smile. </span>
<span sid='35098' title='35098'>The leader alone retained his stern, impressive expression.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35099' title='35099'>'Take him, Brother Stangerson,' he said, 'give him food and drink, and the child likewise. </span>
<span sid='35100' title='35100'>Let it be your task also to teach him our holy creed. </span>
<span sid='35101' title='35101'>We have delayed long enough! </span>
<span sid='35102' title='35102'>Forward! </span>
<span sid='35103' title='35103'>On, on to Zion!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35104' title='35104'>'On, on to Zion!' cried the crowd of Mormons, and the words rippled down the long caravan, passing from mouth to mouth until they died away in a dull murmur in the far distance. </span>
<span sid='35105' title='35105'>With a cracking of whips and a creaking of wheels the great waggons got into motion and soon the whole caravan was winding along once more. </span>
<span sid='35106' title='35106'>The Elder to whose care the two waifs had been committed led them to his waggon, where a meal was already awaiting them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35107' title='35107'>'You shall remain here,' he said. </span>
<span sid='35108' title='35108'>'In a few days you will have recovered from your fatigues. </span>
<span sid='35109' title='35109'>In the meantime, remember that now and for ever you are of our religion. </span>
<span sid='35110' title='35110'>Brigham Young has said it, and he has spoken with the voice of Joseph Smith, which is the voice of God.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35111' title='35111'>CHAPTER 2: The Flower of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Utah&t=h'>Utah</a></span>
<p>
<span sid='35112' title='35112'>This is not the place to commemorate the trials and privations endured by the immigrant Mormons before they came to their final haven. </span>
<span sid='35113' title='35113'>From the shores of the Mississippi to the western slopes of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Rocky Mountains&t=h'>Rocky Mountains</a> they had struggled on with a constancy almost unparalleled in history. </span>
<span sid='35114' title='35114'>The savage man, and the savage beast, hunger, thirst, fatigue, and disease - every impediment which Nature could place in the way - had all been overcome with Anglo-Saxon tenacity. </span>
<span sid='35115' title='35115'>Yet the long journey and the accumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the stoutest among them. </span>
<span sid='35116' title='35116'>There was not one who did not sink upon his knees in heartfelt prayer when they saw the broad valley of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Utah&t=h'>Utah</a> bathed in the sunlight beneath them, and learned from the lips of their leader that this was the promised land, and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for evermore.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35117' title='35117'>Young speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as a resolute chief. </span>
<span sid='35118' title='35118'>Maps were drawn and charts prepared, in which the future city was sketched out. </span>
<span sid='35119' title='35119'>All around farms were apportioned and allotted in proportion to the standing of each individual. </span>
<span sid='35120' title='35120'>The tradesman was put to his trade and the artisan to his calling. </span>
<span sid='35121' title='35121'>In the town streets and squares sprang up as if by magic. </span>
<span sid='35122' title='35122'>In the country there was draining and hedging, planting and clearing, until the next summer saw the whole country golden with the wheat crop. </span>
<span sid='35123' title='35123'>Everything prospered in the strange settlement. </span>
<span sid='35124' title='35124'>Above all, the great temple which they had erected in the centre of the city grew ever taller and larger. </span>
<span sid='35125' title='35125'>From the first blush of dawn until the closing of the twilight, the clatter of the hammer and the rasp of the saw were never absent from the monument which the immigrants erected to Him who had led them safe through many dangers.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35126' title='35126'>The two castaways, John Ferrier and the little girl, who had shared his fortunes and had been adopted as his daughter, accompanied the Mormons to the end of their great pilgrimage. </span>
<span sid='35127' title='35127'>Little Lucy Ferrier was borne along pleasantly enough in Elder Stangerson's waggon, a retreat which she shared with the Mormon's three wives and with his son, a headstrong, forward boy of twelve. </span>
<span sid='35128' title='35128'>Having rallied, with the elasticity of childhood, from the shock caused by her mother's death, she soon became a pet with the women, and reconciled herself to this new life in her moving canvas-covered home. </span>
<span sid='35129' title='35129'>In the meantime Ferrier having recovered from his privations, distinguished himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable hunter. </span>
<span sid='35130' title='35130'>So rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions, that when they reached the end of their wanderings, it was unanimously agreed that he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land as any of the settlers, with the exception of Young himself, and of Stangerson, Kemball, Johnston, and Drebber, who were the four principal Elders.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35131' title='35131'>On the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantial log-house, which received so many additions in succeeding years that it grew into a roomy villa. </span>
<span sid='35132' title='35132'>He was a man of a practical turn of mind, keen in his dealings and skilful with his hands. </span>
<span sid='35133' title='35133'>His iron constitution enabled him to work morning and evening at improving and tilling his lands. </span>
<span sid='35134' title='35134'>Hence it came about that his farm and all that belonged to him prospered exceedingly. </span>
<span sid='35135' title='35135'>In three years he was better off than his neighbours, in six he was well-to-do, in nine he was rich, and in twelve there were not half a dozen men in the whole of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Salt Lake City&t=h'>Salt Lake City</a> who could compare with him. </span>
<span sid='35136' title='35136'>From the great inland sea to the distant Wahsatch Mountains there was no name better known than that of John Ferrier.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35137' title='35137'>There was one way and only one in which he offended the susceptibilities of his co-religionists. </span>
<span sid='35138' title='35138'>No argument or persuasion could ever induce him to set up a female establishment after the manner of his companions. </span>
<span sid='35139' title='35139'>He never gave reasons for this persistent refusal, but contented himself by resolutely and inflexibly adhering to his determination. </span>
<span sid='35140' title='35140'>There were some who accused him of lukewarmness in his adopted religion, and others who put it down to greed of wealth and reluctance to incur expense. </span>
<span sid='35141' title='35141'>Others again spoke of some early love affair, and of a fair-haired girl who had pined away on the shores of the Atlantic. </span>
<span sid='35142' title='35142'>Whatever the reason, Ferrier remained strictly celibate. </span>
<span sid='35143' title='35143'>In every other respect he conformed to the religion of the young settlement, and gained the name of being an orthodox and straight-walking man.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35144' title='35144'>Lucy Ferrier grew up within the log-house, and assisted her adopted father in all his undertakings. </span>
<span sid='35145' title='35145'>The keen air of the mountains and the balsamic odour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to the young girl. </span>
<span sid='35146' title='35146'>As year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger, her cheek more ruddy and her step more elastic. </span>
<span sid='35147' title='35147'>Many a wayfarer upon the high road which ran by Ferrier's farm felt long-forgotten thoughts revive in their minds as they watched her lithe, girlish figure tripping through the wheatfields, or met her mounted upon her father's mustang, and managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the West&t=h'>the West</a>. </span>
<span sid='35148' title='35148'>So the bud blossomed into a flower, and the year which saw her father the richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n girlhood as could be found in the whole Pacific slope.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35149' title='35149'>It was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child had developed into the woman. </span>
<span sid='35150' title='35150'>It seldom is in such cases. </span>
<span sid='35151' title='35151'>That mysterious change is too subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates. </span>
<span sid='35152' title='35152'>Least of all does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the touch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her, and she learns, with a mixture of pride and of fear, that a new and a larger nature has awoke within her. </span>
<span sid='35153' title='35153'>There are few who cannot recall that day and remember the one little incident which heralded the dawn of a new life. </span>
<span sid='35154' title='35154'>In the case of Lucy Ferrier the occasion was serious enough in itself, apart from its future influence on her destiny and that of many besides.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35155' title='35155'>It was a warm June morning, and the Latter Day Saints were as busy as the bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem. </span>
<span sid='35156' title='35156'>In the fields and in the streets rose the same hum of human industry. </span>
<span sid='35157' title='35157'>Down the dusty high roads defiled long streams of heavily-laden mules, all heading to the west, for the gold fever had broken out in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=California&t=h'>California</a>, and the overland route lay through the city of the Elect. </span>
<span sid='35158' title='35158'>There, too, were droves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands, and trains of tired immigrants, men and horses equally weary of their interminable journey. </span>
<span sid='35159' title='35159'>Through all this motley assemblage, threading her way with the skill of an accomplished rider, there galloped Lucy Ferrier, her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out behind her. </span>
<span sid='35160' title='35160'>She had a commission from her father in the city, and was dashing in as she had done many a time before, with all the fearlessness of youth, thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed. </span>
<span sid='35161' title='35161'>The travel-stained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment, and even the unemotional Indians, journeying in with their pelties, relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale-faced maiden.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35162' title='35162'>She had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road blocked by a great drove of cattle, driven by a half-dozen wild-looking herdsmen from the plains. </span>
<span sid='35163' title='35163'>In her impatience she endeavoured to pass this obstacle by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap. </span>
<span sid='35164' title='35164'>Scarcely had she got fairly into it, however, before the beasts closed in behind her, and she found herself completely imbedded in the moving stream of fierce-eyed, long-horned bullocks. </span>
<span sid='35165' title='35165'>Accustomed as she was to deal with cattle, she was not alarmed at her situation, but took advantage of every opportunity to urge her horse on, in the hopes of pushing her way through the cavalcade. </span>
<span sid='35166' title='35166'>Unfortunately the horns of one of the creatures, either by accident or design, came in violent contact with the flank of the mustang, and excited it to madness. </span>
<span sid='35167' title='35167'>In an instant it reared up upon its hind legs with a snort of rage, and pranced and tossed in a way that would have unseated any but a skilful rider. </span>
<span sid='35168' title='35168'>The situation was full of peril. </span>
<span sid='35169' title='35169'>Every plunge of the excited horse brought it against the horns again, and goaded it to fresh madness. </span>
<span sid='35170' title='35170'>It was all that the girl could do to keep herself in the saddle, yet a slip would mean a terrible death under the hoofs of the unwieldy and terrified animals. </span>
<span sid='35171' title='35171'>Unaccustomed to sudden emergencies, her head began to swim, and her grip upon the bridle to relax. </span>
<span sid='35172' title='35172'>Choked by the rising cloud of dust and by the steam from the struggling creatures, she might have abandoned her efforts in despair, but for a kindly voice at her elbow which assured her of assistance. </span>
<span sid='35173' title='35173'>At the same moment a sinewy brown hand caught the frightened horse by the curb, and forcing a way through the drove, soon brought her to the outskirts.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35174' title='35174'>'You're not hurt, I hope, miss,' said her preserver, respectfully.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35175' title='35175'>She looked up at his dark, fierce face, and laughed saucily. </span>
<span sid='35176' title='35176'>'I'm awful frightened,' she said, naÃ¯vely; 'whoever would have thought that Pancho would have been so scared by a lot of cows?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35177' title='35177'>'Thank God you kept your seat,' the other said earnestly. </span>
<span sid='35178' title='35178'>He was a tall, savage-looking young fellow, mounted on a powerful roan horse, and clad in the rough dress of a hunter, with a long rifle slung over his shoulders. </span>
<span sid='35179' title='35179'>'I guess you are the daughter of John Ferrier,' he remarked; 'I saw you ride down from his house. </span>
<span sid='35180' title='35180'>When you see him, ask him if he remembers the Jefferson Hopes of St Louis. </span>
<span sid='35181' title='35181'>If he's the same Ferrier, my father and he were pretty thick.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35182' title='35182'>'Hadn't you better come and ask yourself?' she asked, demurely.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35183' title='35183'>The young fellow seemed pleased at the suggestion, and his dark eyes sparkled with pleasure. </span>
<span sid='35184' title='35184'>'I'll do so,' he said; 'we've been in the mountains for two months, and are not over and above in visiting condition. </span>
<span sid='35185' title='35185'>He must take us as he finds us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35186' title='35186'>'He has a good deal to thank you for, and so have I,' she answered, 'he's awful fond of me. </span>
<span sid='35187' title='35187'>If those cows had jumped on me he'd have never got over it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35188' title='35188'>'Neither would I,' said her companion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35189' title='35189'>'You! </span>
<span sid='35190' title='35190'>Well, I don't see that it would make much matter to you, anyhow. </span>
<span sid='35191' title='35191'>You ain't even a friend of ours.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35192' title='35192'>The young hunter's dark face grew so gloomy over this remark that Lucy Ferrier laughed aloud.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35193' title='35193'>'There, I didn't mean that,' she said; 'of course, you are a friend now. </span>
<span sid='35194' title='35194'>You must come and see us. </span>
<span sid='35195' title='35195'>Now I must push along, or father won't trust me with his business any more. </span>
<span sid='35196' title='35196'>Good-bye!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35197' title='35197'>'Good-bye; he answered, raising his broad sombrero, and bending over her little hand. </span>
<span sid='35198' title='35198'>She wheeled her mustang round, gave it a cut with her riding-whip, and darted away down the broad road in a rolling cloud of dust.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35199' title='35199'>Young Jefferson Hope rode on with his companions, gloomy and taciturn. </span>
<span sid='35200' title='35200'>He and they had been among the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Nevada&t=h'>Nevada</a> Mountains prospecting for silver, and were returning to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Salt Lake City&t=h'>Salt Lake City</a> in the hope of raising capital enough to work some lodes which they had discovered. </span>
<span sid='35201' title='35201'>He had been as keen as any of them upon the business until this sudden incident had drawn his thoughts into another channel. </span>
<span sid='35202' title='35202'>The sight of the fair young girl, as frank and wholesome as the Sierra breezes, had stirred his volcanic, untamed heart to its depths. </span>
<span sid='35203' title='35203'>When she had vanished from his sight, he realized that a crisis had come in his life, and that neither silver speculations nor any other questions could ever be of such importance to him as this new and all-absorbing one. </span>
<span sid='35204' title='35204'>The love which had sprung up in his heart was not the sudden, changeable fancy of a boy, but rather that wild, fierce passion of a man of strong will and imperious temper. </span>
<span sid='35205' title='35205'>He had been accustomed to succeed in all that he undertook. </span>
<span sid='35206' title='35206'>He swore in his heart that he would not fail in this if human effort and human perseverance could render him successful.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35207' title='35207'>He called on John Ferrier that night, and many times again, until his face was a familiar one at the farmhouse. </span>
<span sid='35208' title='35208'>John, cooped up in the valley, and absorbed in his work, had had little chance of learning the news of the outside world during the last twelve years. </span>
<span sid='35209' title='35209'>All this Jefferson Hope was able to tell him, and in a style which interested Lucy as well as her father. </span>
<span sid='35210' title='35210'>He had been a pioneer in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=California&t=h'>California</a>, and could narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost in those wild, halcyon days. </span>
<span sid='35211' title='35211'>He had been a scout, too, and a trapper, a silver explorer, and a ranchman. </span>
<span sid='35212' title='35212'>Wherever stirring adventures were to be had, Jefferson Hope had been there in search of them. </span>
<span sid='35213' title='35213'>He soon became a favourite with the old farmer, who spoke eloquently of his virtues. </span>
<span sid='35214' title='35214'>On such occasions, Lucy was silent, but her blushing cheek and her bright, happy eyes showed only too clearly that her young heart was no longer her own. </span>
<span sid='35215' title='35215'>Her honest father may not have observed these symptoms, but they were assuredly not thrown away upon the man who had won her affections.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35216' title='35216'>One summer evening he came galloping down the road and pulled up at the gate. </span>
<span sid='35217' title='35217'>She was at the doorway, and came down to meet him. </span>
<span sid='35218' title='35218'>He threw the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35219' title='35219'>'I am off, Lucy,' he said, taking her two hands in his, and gazing tenderly down into her face; 'I won't ask you to come with me now, but will you be ready to come when I am here again?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35220' title='35220'>'And when will that be?' she asked, blushing and laughing.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35221' title='35221'>'A couple of months at the outside. </span>
<span sid='35222' title='35222'>I will come and claim you then, my darling. </span>
<span sid='35223' title='35223'>There's no one who can stand between us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35224' title='35224'>'And how about father?' she asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35225' title='35225'>'He has given his consent, provided we get these mines working all right. </span>
<span sid='35226' title='35226'>I have no fear on that head.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35227' title='35227'>'Oh, well; of course, if you and father have arranged it all, there's no more to be said,' she whispered, with her cheek against his broad breast.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35228' title='35228'>Thank God!' he said, hoarsely, stooping and kissing her. </span>
<span sid='35229' title='35229'>'It is settled, then. </span>
<span sid='35230' title='35230'>The longer I stay, the harder it will be to go. </span>
<span sid='35231' title='35231'>They are waiting for me at the caÃ±on. </span>
<span sid='35232' title='35232'>Good-bye, my own darling - good-bye. </span>
<span sid='35233' title='35233'>In two months you shall see me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35234' title='35234'>He tore himself from her as he spoke, and, flinging himself upon his horse, galloped furiously away, never even looking round, as though afraid that his resolution might fail him if he took one glance at what he was leaving. </span>
<span sid='35235' title='35235'>She stood at the gate, gazing after him until he vanished from her sight. </span>
<span sid='35236' title='35236'>Then she walked back into the house, the happiest girl in all <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Utah&t=h'>Utah</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35237' title='35237'>CHAPTER 3: John Ferrier Talks with the Prophet</span>
<p>
<span sid='35238' title='35238'>Three weeks had passed since Jefferson Hope and his comrades had departed from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Salt Lake City&t=h'>Salt Lake City</a>. </span>
<span sid='35239' title='35239'>John Ferrier's heart was sore within him when he thought of the young man's return, and of the impending loss of his adopted child. </span>
<span sid='35240' title='35240'>Yet her bright and happy face reconciled him to the arrangement more than any argument could have done. </span>
<span sid='35241' title='35241'>He had always determined, deep down in his resolute heart, that nothing would ever induce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. </span>
<span sid='35242' title='35242'>Such a marriage he regarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and a disgrace. </span>
<span sid='35243' title='35243'>Whatever he might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that one point he was inflexible. </span>
<span sid='35244' title='35244'>He had to seal his mouth on the subject, however, for to express an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in the Land of the Saints.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35245' title='35245'>Yes, a dangerous matter - so dangerous that even the most saintly dared only whisper their religious opinions with bated breath, lest something which fell from their lips might be misconstrued, and bring down a swift retribution upon them. </span>
<span sid='35246' title='35246'>The victims of persecution had now turned persecutors on their own account and persecutors of the most terrible description. </span>
<span sid='35247' title='35247'>Not the Inquisition of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Seville&t=h'>Seville</a>, nor the German Vehmgericht, nor the Secret Societies of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Italy&t=h'>Italy</a>, were ever able to put a more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over the State of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Utah&t=h'>Utah</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35248' title='35248'>Its invisibility, and the mystery which was attached to it, made this organization doubly terrible. </span>
<span sid='35249' title='35249'>It appeared to be omniscient and omnipotent, and yet was neither seen nor heard. </span>
<span sid='35250' title='35250'>The man who held out against the Church vanished away, and none knew whither he had gone or what had befallen him. </span>
<span sid='35251' title='35251'>His wife and his children awaited him at home, but no father ever returned to tell them how he had fared at the hands of his secret judges. </span>
<span sid='35252' title='35252'>A rash word or a hasty act was followed by annihilation, and yet none knew what the nature might be of this terrible power which was suspended over them. </span>
<span sid='35253' title='35253'>No wonder that men went about in fear and trembling, and that even in the heart of the wilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35254' title='35254'>At first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the recalcitrants who, having embraced the Mormon faith, wished afterwards to pervert or to abandon it. </span>
<span sid='35255' title='35255'>Soon, however, it took a wider range The supply of adult women was running short, and polygamy without a female population on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed. </span>
<span sid='35256' title='35256'>Strange rumours began to be bandied about - rumours of murdered immigrants and rifled camps in regions where Indians had never been seen. </span>
<span sid='35257' title='35257'>Fresh women appeared in the harems of the Elders - women who pined and wept, and bore upon their faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror. </span>
<span sid='35258' title='35258'>Belated wanderers upon the mountains spoke of gangs of armed men, masked, stealthy, and noiseless, who flitted by them in the darkness. </span>
<span sid='35259' title='35259'>These tales and rumours took substance and shape, and were corroborated and recorroborated, until they resolved themselves into a definite name. </span>
<span sid='35260' title='35260'>To this day, in the lonely ranches of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the West&t=h'>the West</a>, the name of the Danite Band, or the Avenging Angels, is a sinister and an ill-omened one.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35261' title='35261'>Fuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible results served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it inspired in the minds of men. </span>
<span sid='35262' title='35262'>None knew who belonged to this ruthless society. </span>
<span sid='35263' title='35263'>The names of the participators in the deeds of blood and violence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret. </span>
<span sid='35264' title='35264'>The very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to the Prophet and his mission might be one of those who would come forth at night with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation. </span>
<span sid='35265' title='35265'>Hence every man feared his neighbour, and none spoke of the things which were nearest his heart.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35266' title='35266'>One fine morning John Ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields, when he heard the click of the latch, and, looking through the window, saw a stout, sandy-haired middle-aged man coming up the pathway. </span>
<span sid='35267' title='35267'>His heart leapt to his mouth, for this was none other than the great Brigham Young himself. </span>
<span sid='35268' title='35268'>Full of trepidation - for he knew that such a visit boded him little good - Ferrier ran to the door to greet the Mormon chief. </span>
<span sid='35269' title='35269'>The latter, however, received his salutations coldly, and followed him with a stern face into the sitting-room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35270' title='35270'>'Brother Ferrier,' he said, taking a seat, and eyeing the farmer keenly from under his light-coloured eyelashes, 'the true believers have been good friends to you. </span>
<span sid='35271' title='35271'>We picked you up when you were starving in the desert, we shared our food with you, led you safe to the Chosen Valley, gave you a goodly share of land, and allowed you to wax rich under our protection. </span>
<span sid='35272' title='35272'>Is not this so?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35273' title='35273'>'It is so,' answered John Ferrier.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35274' title='35274'>'In return for all this we asked but one condition: that was, that you should embrace the true faith, and conform in every way to its usages. </span>
<span sid='35275' title='35275'>This you promised to do, and this, if common report says truly, you have neglected.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35276' title='35276'>'And how have I neglected it?' asked Ferrier, throwing out his hands in expostulation. </span>
<span sid='35277' title='35277'>'Have I not given to the common fund? </span>
<span sid='35278' title='35278'>Have I not attended at the Temple? </span>
<span sid='35279' title='35279'>Have I not-?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35280' title='35280'>'Where are your wives?' asked Young, looking round him. </span>
<span sid='35281' title='35281'>'Call them in, that I may greet them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35282' title='35282'>'It is true that I have not married,' Ferrier answered. </span>
<span sid='35283' title='35283'>'But women were few, and there were many who had better claims than I. </span>
<span sid='35284' title='35284'>I was not a lonely man: I had my daughter to attend to my wants.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35285' title='35285'>'It is of that daughter that I would speak to you,' said the leader of the Mormons. </span>
<span sid='35286' title='35286'>'She has grown to be the flower of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Utah&t=h'>Utah</a>, and has found favour in the eyes of many who are high in the land-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35287' title='35287'>John Ferrier groaned inwardly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35288' title='35288'>'There are stories of her which I would fain disbelieve stories that she is sealed to some Gentile. </span>
<span sid='35289' title='35289'>This must be the gossip of idle tongues.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35290' title='35290'>What is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted Joseph Smith? </span>
<span sid='35291' title='35291'>"Let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the Elect; for if she wed a Gentile, she commits a grievous sin." </span>
<span sid='35292' title='35292'>This being so, it is impossible that you, who profess the holy creed, should suffer your daughter to violate it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35293' title='35293'>John Ferrier made no answer, but he played nervously with his riding-whip.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35294' title='35294'>'Upon this one point your whole faith shall be tested - so it has been decided in the Sacred Council of Four. </span>
<span sid='35295' title='35295'>The girl is young, and we would not have her wed grey hairs, neither would we deprive her of all choice. </span>
<span sid='35296' title='35296'>We Elders have many heifers, but our children must also be provided. </span>
<span sid='35297' title='35297'>Stangerson has a son, and Drebber has a son, and either of them would gladly welcome your daughter to their house. </span>
<span sid='35298' title='35298'>Let her choose between them. </span>
<span sid='35299' title='35299'>They are young and rich, and of the true faith. </span>
<span sid='35300' title='35300'>What say you to that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35301' title='35301'>Ferrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35302' title='35302'>'You will give us time,' he said at last. </span>
<span sid='35303' title='35303'>'My daughter is very young - she is scarce of an age to marry.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35304' title='35304'>'She shall have a month to choose,' said Young, rising from his seat. </span>
<span sid='35305' title='35305'>'At the end of that time she shall give her answer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35306' title='35306'>He was passing through the door, when he turned, with flushed face and flashing eyes. </span>
<span sid='35307' title='35307'>'It were better for you, John Ferrier,' he thundered, 'that you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the Sierra Blanco, than that you should put your weak wills against the orders of the Holy Four!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35308' title='35308'>With a threatening gesture of his hand, he turned from the door, and Ferrier heard his heavy steps scrunching along the shingly path.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35309' title='35309'>He was still sitting with his elbow upon his knee considering how he should broach the matter to his daughter, when a soft hand was laid upon his, and looking up, he saw her standing beside him. </span>
<span sid='35310' title='35310'>One glance at her pale, frightened face showed him that she had heard what had passed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35311' title='35311'>'I could not help it,' she said, in answer to his look. </span>
<span sid='35312' title='35312'>'His voice rang through the house. </span>
<span sid='35313' title='35313'>Oh, father, father, what shall we do?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35314' title='35314'>'Don't you scare yourself,' he answered, drawing her to him, and passing his broad, rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair. </span>
<span sid='35315' title='35315'>'We'll fix it up somehow or another. </span>
<span sid='35316' title='35316'>You don't find your fancy kind o' lessening for this chap, do you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35317' title='35317'>A sob and a squeeze of his hand was her only answer.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35318' title='35318'>'No; of course not. </span>
<span sid='35319' title='35319'>I shouldn't care to hear you say you did. </span>
<span sid='35320' title='35320'>He's a likely lad, and he's a Christian, which is more than these folk here, in spite o' all their praying and preaching. </span>
<span sid='35321' title='35321'>There's a party starting for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Nevada&t=h'>Nevada</a> tomorrow, and I'll manage to send him a message letting him know the hole we are in. </span>
<span sid='35322' title='35322'>If I know anything o' that young man, he'll be back here with a speed that would whip electro-telegraphs.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35323' title='35323'>Lucy laughed through her tears at her father's description.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35324' title='35324'>'When he comes, he will advise us for the best. </span>
<span sid='35325' title='35325'>But it is for you that I am frightened, dear. </span>
<span sid='35326' title='35326'>One hears - one hears such dreadful stories about those who oppose the Prophet: </span>
<span sid='35327' title='35327'>something terrible always happens to them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35328' title='35328'>'But we haven't opposed him yet,' her father answered. </span>
<span sid='35329' title='35329'>'It will be time to look out for squalls when we do. </span>
<span sid='35330' title='35330'>We have a clear month before us; at the end of that, I guess we had best shin out of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Utah&t=h'>Utah</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35331' title='35331'>'Leave <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Utah&t=h'>Utah</a>!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35332' title='35332'>'That's about the size of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35333' title='35333'>'But the farm?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35334' title='35334'>'We will raise as much as we can in money, and let the rest go. </span>
<span sid='35335' title='35335'>To tell the truth, Lucy, it isn't the first time I have thought of doing it. </span>
<span sid='35336' title='35336'>I don't care about knuckling under to any man, as these folk do to their darned Prophet. </span>
<span sid='35337' title='35337'>I'm a free-born <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n, and it's all new to me. </span>
<span sid='35338' title='35338'>Guess I'm too old to learn. </span>
<span sid='35339' title='35339'>If he comes browsing about this farm, he might chance to run up against a charge of buck-shot travelling in the opposite direction.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35340' title='35340'>'But they won't let us leave,' his daughter objected.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35341' title='35341'>'Wait till Jefferson comes, and we'll soon manage that. </span>
<span sid='35342' title='35342'>In the meantime, don't you fret yourself, my dearie, and don't get your eyes swelled up, else he'll be walking into me when he sees you. </span>
<span sid='35343' title='35343'>There's nothing to be afeard about, and there's no danger at all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35344' title='35344'>John Ferrier uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident tone, but she could not help observing that he paid unusual care to the fastening of the doors that night, and that he carefully cleaned and loaded the rusty old shot-gun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35345' title='35345'>CHAPTER 4: A Flight for Life</span>
<p>
<span sid='35346' title='35346'>On the morning which followed his interview with the Mormon Prophet, John Ferrier went in to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Salt Lake City&t=h'>Salt Lake City</a>, and having found his acquaintance, who was bound for the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Nevada&t=h'>Nevada</a> Mountains, he entrusted him with his message to Jefferson Hope. </span>
<span sid='35347' title='35347'>In it he told the young man of the imminent danger which threatened them, and how necessary it was that he should return. </span>
<span sid='35348' title='35348'>Having done thus he felt easier in his mind, and returned home with a lighter heart.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35349' title='35349'>As he approached his farm, he was surprised to see a horse hitched to each of the posts of the gate. </span>
<span sid='35350' title='35350'>Still more surprised was he on entering to find two young men in possession of his sitting-room. </span>
<span sid='35351' title='35351'>One, with a long pale face, was leaning back in the rocking-chair, with his feet cocked up upon the stove. </span>
<span sid='35352' title='35352'>The other, a bull-necked youth with coarse, bloated features, was standing in front of the window with his hands in his pockets whistling a popular hymn. </span>
<span sid='35353' title='35353'>Both of them nodded to Ferrier as he entered, and the one in the rocking-chair commenced the conversation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35354' title='35354'>'Maybe you don't know us,' he said. </span>
<span sid='35355' title='35355'>This here is the son of Elder Drebber, and I'm Joseph Stangerson, who travelled with you in the desert when the Lord stretched out His hand and gathered you into the true fold.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35356' title='35356'>'As He will all the nations in His own good time,' said the other in a nasal voice; 'He grindeth slowly but exceeding small.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35357' title='35357'>John Ferrier bowed coldly. </span>
<span sid='35358' title='35358'>He had guessed who his visitors were.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35359' title='35359'>'We have come,' continued Stangerson, 'at the advice of our fathers to solicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to you and to her. </span>
<span sid='35360' title='35360'>As I have but four wives and Brother Drebber here has seven, it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35361' title='35361'>Way, nay, Brother Stangerson,' cried the other; 'the question is not how many wives we have, but how many we can keep. </span>
<span sid='35362' title='35362'>My father has now given over his mills to me, and I am the richer man.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35363' title='35363'>'But my prospects are better,' said the other, warmly. </span>
<span sid='35364' title='35364'>'When the Lord removes my father, I shall have his tanning yard and his leather factory. </span>
<span sid='35365' title='35365'>Then I am your elder, and am higher in the Church.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35366' title='35366'>'It will be for the maiden to decide,' rejoined young Drebber, smirking at his own reflection in the glass. </span>
<span sid='35367' title='35367'>'We will leave it all to her decision.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35368' title='35368'>During this dialogue John Ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway, hardly able to keep his riding-whip from the backs of his two visitors.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35369' title='35369'>'Look here,' he said at last, striding up to them, 'when my daughter summons you, you can come, but until then I don't want to see your faces again.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35370' title='35370'>The two young Mormons stared at him in amazement. </span>
<span sid='35371' title='35371'>In their eyes this competition between them for the maiden's hand was the highest of honours both to her and her father.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35372' title='35372'>'There are two ways out of the room,' cried Ferrier; 'there is the door, and there is the window. </span>
<span sid='35373' title='35373'>Which do you care to use?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35374' title='35374'>His brown face looked so savage, and his gaunt hands so threatening, that his visitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat. </span>
<span sid='35375' title='35375'>The old farmer followed them to the door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35376' title='35376'>'Let me know when you have settled which it is to be,' he said, sardonically.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35377' title='35377'>'You shall smart for this!' Stangerson cried, white with rage. </span>
<span sid='35378' title='35378'>'You have defied the Prophet and the Council of Four. </span>
<span sid='35379' title='35379'>You shall rue it to the end of your days.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35380' title='35380'>'The hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon you,' cried young Drebber; 'He will arise and smite you!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35381' title='35381'>'Then start the smiting,' exclaimed Ferrier, furiously, and would have rushed upstairs for his gun had not Lucy seized him by the arm and restrained him. </span>
<span sid='35382' title='35382'>Before he could escape from her, the clatter of horses' hoofs told him that they were beyond his reach.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35383' title='35383'>'The young canting rascals!' he exclaimed, wiping the perspiration from his forehead; 'I would sooner see you in your grave, my girl, than the wife of either of them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35384' title='35384'>'And so should I, father,' she answered, with spirit; 'but Jefferson will soon be here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35385' title='35385'>'Yes. </span>
<span sid='35386' title='35386'>It will not be long before he comes. </span>
<span sid='35387' title='35387'>The sooner the better, for we do not know what their next move may be.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35388' title='35388'>It was, indeed, high time that someone capable of giving advice and help should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted daughter. </span>
<span sid='35389' title='35389'>In the whole history of the settlement there had never been such a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the Elders. </span>
<span sid='35390' title='35390'>If minor errors were punished so sternly, what would be the fate of this arch rebel? </span>
<span sid='35391' title='35391'>Ferrier knew that his wealth and position would be of no avail to him. </span>
<span sid='35392' title='35392'>Others as well known and as rich as himself had been spirited away before now, and their goods given over to the Church. </span>
<span sid='35393' title='35393'>He was a brave man, but he trembled at the vague, shadowy terrors which hung over him. </span>
<span sid='35394' title='35394'>Any known danger he could face with a firm lip, but this suspense was unnerving. </span>
<span sid='35395' title='35395'>He concealed his fears from his daughter, however, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she, with the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35396' title='35396'>He expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from Young as to his conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in an unlooked-for manner. </span>
<span sid='35397' title='35397'>Upon rising next morning he found, to his surprise, a small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed just over his chest. </span>
<span sid='35398' title='35398'>On it was printed, in bold, straggling letters:</span>
<p>
<span sid='35399' title='35399'>'Twenty-nine days are given you for amendment, and then-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35400' title='35400'>The dash was more fear-inspiring than any threat could have been. </span>
<span sid='35401' title='35401'>How this warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely, for his servants slept in an outhouse, and the doors and windows had all been secured. </span>
<span sid='35402' title='35402'>He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter, but the incident struck a chill into his heart. </span>
<span sid='35403' title='35403'>The twenty-nine days were evidently the balance of the month which Young had promised. </span>
<span sid='35404' title='35404'>What strength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such mysterious powers? </span>
<span sid='35405' title='35405'>The hand which fastened that pin might have struck him to the heart, and he could never have known who had slain him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35406' title='35406'>Still more shaken was he next morning. </span>
<span sid='35407' title='35407'>They had sat down to their breakfast, when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards. </span>
<span sid='35408' title='35408'>In the centre of the ceiling was scrawled, with a burned stick apparently, the number 28. </span>
<span sid='35409' title='35409'>To his daughter it was unintelligible, and he did not enlighten her. </span>
<span sid='35410' title='35410'>That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and ward. </span>
<span sid='35411' title='35411'>He saw and he heard nothing, and yet in the morning a great 27 had been painted upon the outside of his door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35412' title='35412'>Thus day followed day; and as sure as morning came he found that his unseen enemies had kept their register, and had marked up in some conspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the month of grace. </span>
<span sid='35413' title='35413'>Sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls, sometimes upon the floors, occasionally they were on small placards stuck upon the garden gate or the railings. </span>
<span sid='35414' title='35414'>With all his vigilance John Ferrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded. </span>
<span sid='35415' title='35415'>A horror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of them. </span>
<span sid='35416' title='35416'>He became haggard and restless, and his eyes had the troubled look of some hunted creature. </span>
<span sid='35417' title='35417'>He had but one hope in life now, and that was for the arrival of the young hunter from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Nevada&t=h'>Nevada</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35418' title='35418'>Twenty had changed to fifteen, and fifteen to ten, but there was no news of the absentee. </span>
<span sid='35419' title='35419'>One by one the numbers dwindled down, and still there came no sign of him. </span>
<span sid='35420' title='35420'>Whenever a horseman clattered down the road, or a driver shouted at his team, the old farmer hurried to the gate, thinking that help had arrived at last. </span>
<span sid='35421' title='35421'>At last, when he saw five give way to four and that again to three, he lost heart, and abandoned all hope of escape. </span>
<span sid='35422' title='35422'>Single-handed, and with his limited knowledge of the mountains which surrounded the settlement, he knew that he was powerless. </span>
<span sid='35423' title='35423'>The more frequented roads were strictly watched and guarded, and none could pass along them without an order from the Council. </span>
<span sid='35424' title='35424'>Turn which way he would, there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him. </span>
<span sid='35425' title='35425'>Yet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life itself before he consented to what he regarded as his daughter's dishonour.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35426' title='35426'>He was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles, and searching vainly for some way out of them. </span>
<span sid='35427' title='35427'>That morning had shown the figure 2 upon the wall of his house, and the next day would be the last of the allotted time. </span>
<span sid='35428' title='35428'>What was to happen then? </span>
<span sid='35429' title='35429'>All manner of vague and terrible fancies filled his imagination. </span>
<span sid='35430' title='35430'>And his daughter - what was to become of her after he was gone? </span>
<span sid='35431' title='35431'>Was there no escape from the invisible network which was drawn all round them? </span>
<span sid='35432' title='35432'>He sank his head upon the table and sobbed at the thought of his own impotence.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35433' title='35433'>What was that? </span>
<span sid='35434' title='35434'>In the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound - low, but very distinct in the quiet of the night. </span>
<span sid='35435' title='35435'>It came from the door of the house. </span>
<span sid='35436' title='35436'>Ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently. </span>
<span sid='35437' title='35437'>There was a pause for a few moments, and then the low, insidious sound was repeated. </span>
<span sid='35438' title='35438'>Someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the panels of the door. </span>
<span sid='35439' title='35439'>Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry out the murderous orders of the secret tribunal? </span>
<span sid='35440' title='35440'>Or was it some agent who was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived? </span>
<span sid='35441' title='35441'>John Ferrier felt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook his nerves and chilled his heart. </span>
<span sid='35442' title='35442'>Springing forward, he drew the bolt and threw the door open.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35443' title='35443'>Outside all was calm and quiet. </span>
<span sid='35444' title='35444'>The night was fine, and the stars were twinkling brightly overhead. </span>
<span sid='35445' title='35445'>The little front garden lay before the farmer's eyes bounded by the fence and gate, but neither there nor on the road was any human being to be seen. </span>
<span sid='35446' title='35446'>With a sigh of relief, Ferrier looked to right and to left, until, happening to glance straight down at his own feet, he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his face upon the ground, with arms and legs all asprawl.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35447' title='35447'>So unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall with his hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out. </span>
<span sid='35448' title='35448'>His first thought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying man, but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into the hall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent. </span>
<span sid='35449' title='35449'>Once within the house the man sprang to his feet, closed the door, and revealed to the astonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of Jefferson Hope.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35450' title='35450'>'Good God!' gasped John Ferrier. </span>
<span sid='35451' title='35451'>'How you scared me. </span>
<span sid='35452' title='35452'>Whatever made you come in like that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35453' title='35453'>'Give me food,' the other said hoarsely. </span>
<span sid='35454' title='35454'>'I have had no time for bite or sup for eight-and-forty hours.' </span>
<span sid='35455' title='35455'>He flung himself upon the cold meat and bread which were still lying upon the table from his host's supper, and devoured it voraciously. </span>
<span sid='35456' title='35456'>'Does Lucy bear up well?' he asked, when he had satisfied his hunger.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35457' title='35457'>'Yes. </span>
<span sid='35458' title='35458'>She does not know the danger,' her father answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35459' title='35459'>'That is well. </span>
<span sid='35460' title='35460'>The house is watched on every side. </span>
<span sid='35461' title='35461'>That is why I crawled my way up to it. </span>
<span sid='35462' title='35462'>They may be darned sharp, but they're not quite sharp enough to catch a Washoe hunter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35463' title='35463'>John Ferrier felt a different man now that he realized that he had a devoted ally. </span>
<span sid='35464' title='35464'>He seized the young man's leathery hand and wrung it cordially. </span>
<span sid='35465' title='35465'>'You're a man to be proud of,' he said. </span>
<span sid='35466' title='35466'>'There are not many who would come to share our danger and our troubles.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35467' title='35467'>'You've hit it there, pard,' the young hunter answered. </span>
<span sid='35468' title='35468'>'I have a respect for you, but if you were alone in this business I'd think twice before I put my head into such a hornets' nest. </span>
<span sid='35469' title='35469'>It's Lucy that brings me here, and before harm comes on her I guess there will be one less o' the Hope family in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Utah&t=h'>Utah</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35470' title='35470'>'What are we to do?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35471' title='35471'>'To-morrow is your last day, and unless you act tonight you are lost. </span>
<span sid='35472' title='35472'>I have a mule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine. </span>
<span sid='35473' title='35473'>How much money have you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35474' title='35474'>Two thousand dollars in gold and five in notes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35475' title='35475'>'That will do. </span>
<span sid='35476' title='35476'>I have as much more to add to it. </span>
<span sid='35477' title='35477'>We must push for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Carson City&t=h'>Carson City</a> through the mountains You had best wake Lucy. </span>
<span sid='35478' title='35478'>It is as well that the servants do not sleep in the house.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35479' title='35479'>While Ferrier was absent, preparing his daughter for the approaching journey, Jefferson Hope packed all the eatables that he could find into a small parcel, and filled a stoneware jar with water, for he knew by experience that the mountain wells were few and far between. </span>
<span sid='35480' title='35480'>He had hardly completed his arrangements before the farmer returned with his daughter all dressed and ready for a start. </span>
<span sid='35481' title='35481'>The greeting between the lovers was warm, but brief, for minutes were precious, and there was much to be done.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35482' title='35482'>'We must make our start at once,' said Jefferson Hope, speaking in a low but resolute voice, like one who realizes the greatness of the peril, but has steeled his heart to meet it. </span>
<span sid='35483' title='35483'>The front and back entrances are watched, but with caution we may get away through the side window and across the fields. </span>
<span sid='35484' title='35484'>Once on the road we are only two miles from the Ravine where the horses are waiting. </span>
<span sid='35485' title='35485'>By daybreak we should be half-way through the mountains.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35486' title='35486'>'What if we are stopped?' asked Ferrier.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35487' title='35487'>Hope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his tunic. </span>
<span sid='35488' title='35488'>'If they are too many for us, we shall take two or three of them with us,' he said with a sinister smile.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35489' title='35489'>The lights inside the house had all been extinguished, and from the darkened window Ferrier peered over the fields which had been his own, and which he was now about to abandon for ever. </span>
<span sid='35490' title='35490'>He had long nerved himself to the sacrifice, however, and the thought of the honour and happiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes. </span>
<span sid='35491' title='35491'>All looked so peaceful and happy, the rustling trees and the broad silent stretch of grainland, that it was difficult to realize that the spirit of murder lurked through it all. </span>
<span sid='35492' title='35492'>Yet the white face and set expression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house he had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35493' title='35493'>Ferrier carried the bag of gold and notes, Jefferson Hope had the scanty provisions and water, while Lucy had a small bundle containing a few of her more valued possessions. </span>
<span sid='35494' title='35494'>Opening the window very slowly and carefully, they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the night, and then one by one passed through into the little garden. </span>
<span sid='35495' title='35495'>With bated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it, and gained the shelter of the hedge, which they skirted until they came to the gap which opened into the cornfield. </span>
<span sid='35496' title='35496'>They had just reached this point when the young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the shadow, where they lay silent and trembling.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35497' title='35497'>It was as well that his prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the ears of a lynx. </span>
<span sid='35498' title='35498'>He and his friends had hardly crouched down before the melancholy hooting of a mountain owl was heard within a few yards of them, which was immediately answered by another hoot at a small distance. </span>
<span sid='35499' title='35499'>At the same moment a vague, shadowy figure emerged from the gap for which they had been making, and uttered the plaintive signal cry again, on which a second man appeared out of the obscurity.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35500' title='35500'>'To-morrow at midnight,' said the first, who appeared to be in authority. </span>
<span sid='35501' title='35501'>'When the Whip-poor-Will calls three times.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35502' title='35502'>'It is well,' returned the other. </span>
<span sid='35503' title='35503'>'Shall I tell Brother Drebber?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35504' title='35504'>'Pass it on to him, and from him to the others. </span>
<span sid='35505' title='35505'>Nine to seven!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35506' title='35506'>Seven to five!' repeated the other; and the two figures flitted away in different directions. </span>
<span sid='35507' title='35507'>Their concluding words had evidently been some form of sign and countersign. </span>
<span sid='35508' title='35508'>The instant that their footsteps had died away in the distance, Jefferson Hope sprang to his feet, and helping his companions through the gap, led the way across the fields at the top of his speed, supporting and half-carrying the girl when her strength appeared to fail her.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35509' title='35509'>'Hurry on! hurry on!' he gasped from time to time. </span>
<span sid='35510' title='35510'>'We are through the line of sentinels. </span>
<span sid='35511' title='35511'>Everything depends on speed. </span>
<span sid='35512' title='35512'>Hurry on!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35513' title='35513'>Once on the high road, they made rapid progress. </span>
<span sid='35514' title='35514'>Only once did they meet anyone, and then they managed to slip into a field, and so avoid recognition. </span>
<span sid='35515' title='35515'>Before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a rugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains. </span>
<span sid='35516' title='35516'>Two dark, jagged peaks loomed above them through the darkness, and the defile which led between them was the Eagle CaÃ±on in which the horses were awaiting them. </span>
<span sid='35517' title='35517'>With unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his way among the great boulders and along the bed of a dried-up water-course, until he came to the retired corner screened with rocks, where the faithful animals had been picketed. </span>
<span sid='35518' title='35518'>The girl was placed upon the mule, and old Ferrier upon one of the horses, with his money-bag, while Jefferson Hope led the other along the precipitous and dangerous path.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35519' title='35519'>It was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face Nature in her wildest moods. </span>
<span sid='35520' title='35520'>On the one side a great crag towered up a thousand feet or more, black, stern, and menacing, with long basaltic columns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some petrified monster. </span>
<span sid='35521' title='35521'>On the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris made all advance impossible. </span>
<span sid='35522' title='35522'>Between the two ran the irregular track, so narrow in places that they had to travel in Indian file, and so rough that only practised riders could have traversed it at all. </span>
<span sid='35523' title='35523'>Yet, in spite of all dangers and difficulties, the hearts of the fugitives were light within them, for every step increased the distance between them and the terrible despotism from which they were flying.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35524' title='35524'>They soon had a proof, however, that they were still within the jurisdiction of the Saints. </span>
<span sid='35525' title='35525'>They had reached the very wildest and most desolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry, and pointed upwards. </span>
<span sid='35526' title='35526'>On a rock which overlooked the track, showing out dark and plain against the sky, there stood a solitary sentinel. </span>
<span sid='35527' title='35527'>He saw them as soon as they perceived him, and his military challenge of 'Who goes there?' </span>
<span sid='35528' title='35528'>rang through the silent ravine.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35529' title='35529'>'Travellers for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Nevada&t=h'>Nevada</a>,' said Jefferson Hope, with his hand upon the rifle which hung by his saddle.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35530' title='35530'>They could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun, and peering down at them as if dissatisfied at their reply. </span>
<span sid='35531' title='35531'>'By whose permission?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35532' title='35532'>'The Holy Four,' answered Ferrier. </span>
<span sid='35533' title='35533'>His Mormon experiences had taught him that that was the highest authority to which he could refer.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35534' title='35534'>'Nine to seven,' cried the sentinel.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35535' title='35535'>'Seven to five,' returned Jefferson Hope promptly, remembering the countersign which he had heard in the garden.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35536' title='35536'>'Pass, and the Lord go with you,' said the voice from above. </span>
<span sid='35537' title='35537'>Beyond his post the path broadened out, and the horses were able to break into a trot. </span>
<span sid='35538' title='35538'>Looking back, they could see the solitary watcher leaning upon his gun, and knew that they had passed the outlying post of the chosen people, and that freedom lay before them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35539' title='35539'>CHAPTER 5: The Avenging Angels</span>
<p>
<span sid='35540' title='35540'>All night their course lay through intricate defiles and over irregular and rock-strewn paths. </span>
<span sid='35541' title='35541'>More than once they lost their way, but Hope's intimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track once more. </span>
<span sid='35542' title='35542'>When morning broke, a scene of marvellous though savage beauty lay before them. </span>
<span sid='35543' title='35543'>In every direction the great snowcapped peaks hemmed them in, peeping over each other's shoulders to the far horizon. </span>
<span sid='35544' title='35544'>So steep were the rocky banks on either side of them that the larch and the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads, and to need only a gust of wind to come hurtling down upon them. </span>
<span sid='35545' title='35545'>Nor was the fear entirely an illusion, for the barren valley was thickly strewn with trees and boulders which had fallen in a similar manner. </span>
<span sid='35546' title='35546'>Even as they passed, a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which woke the echoes in the silent gorges, and startled the weary horses into a gallop.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35547' title='35547'>As the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the great mountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival, until they were all ruddy and glowing. </span>
<span sid='35548' title='35548'>The magnificent spectacle cheered the hearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy. </span>
<span sid='35549' title='35549'>At a wild torrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered their horses, while they partook of a hasty breakfast. </span>
<span sid='35550' title='35550'>Lucy and her father would fain have rested longer, but Jefferson Hope was inexorable. </span>
<span sid='35551' title='35551'>'They will be upon our track by this time,' he said. </span>
<span sid='35552' title='35552'>'Everything depends upon our speed. </span>
<span sid='35553' title='35553'>Once safe in Carson, we may rest for the remainder of our lives.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35554' title='35554'>During the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles, and by evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from their enemies. </span>
<span sid='35555' title='35555'>At night-time they chose the base of a beetling crag, where the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind, and there, huddled together for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours' sleep. </span>
<span sid='35556' title='35556'>Before daybreak, however, they were up and on their way once more. </span>
<span sid='35557' title='35557'>They had seen no signs of any pursuers, and Jefferson Hope began to think that they were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose enmity they had incurred. </span>
<span sid='35558' title='35558'>He little knew how far that iron grasp could reach, or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35559' title='35559'>About the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store of provisions began to run out. </span>
<span sid='35560' title='35560'>This gave the hunter little uneasiness, however, for there was game to be had among the mountains, and he had frequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life. </span>
<span sid='35561' title='35561'>Choosing a sheltered nook, he piled together a few dried branches and made a blazing fire, at which his companions might warm themselves, for they were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level, and the air was bitter and keen. </span>
<span sid='35562' title='35562'>Having tethered the horses, and bade Lucy adieu, he threw his gun over his shoulder, and set out in search of whatever chance might throw in his way. </span>
<span sid='35563' title='35563'>Looking back, he saw the old man and the young girl crouching over the blazing fire, while the three animals stood motionless in the background. </span>
<span sid='35564' title='35564'>Then the intervening rocks hid them from his view.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35565' title='35565'>He walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another without success, though, from the marks upon the bark of the trees, and other indications, he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity At last, after two or three hours' fruitless search, he was thinking of turning back in despair, when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart. </span>
<span sid='35566' title='35566'>On the edge of a jutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet above him, there stood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance, but armed with a pair of gigantic horns. </span>
<span sid='35567' title='35567'>The big-horn - for so it is called - was acting, probably, as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the hunter; but fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction, and had not perceived him. </span>
<span sid='35568' title='35568'>Lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon a rock, and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger. </span>
<span sid='35569' title='35569'>The animal sprang into the air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice, and then came crashing down into the valley beneath.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35570' title='35570'>The creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented himself with cutting away one haunch and part of the flank. </span>
<span sid='35571' title='35571'>With this trophy over his shoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps, for the evening was already drawing in. </span>
<span sid='35572' title='35572'>He had hardly started, however, before he realized the difficulty which faced him. </span>
<span sid='35573' title='35573'>In his eagerness he had wandered far past the ravines which were known to him, and it was no easy matter to pick out the path which he had taken The valley in which he found himself divided and sub-divided into many gorges, which were so like each other that it was impossible to distinguish one from the other. </span>
<span sid='35574' title='35574'>He followed one for a mile or more until he came to a mountain torrent which he was sure that he had never seen before. </span>
<span sid='35575' title='35575'>Convinced that he had taken the wrong turn, he tried another, but with the same result. </span>
<span sid='35576' title='35576'>Night was coming on rapidly, and it was almost dark before he at last found himself in a defile which was familiar to him. </span>
<span sid='35577' title='35577'>Even then it was no easy matter to keep to the right track, for the moon had not yet risen, and the high cliffs on either side made the obscurity more profound. </span>
<span sid='35578' title='35578'>Weighed down with his burden, and weary from his exertions, he stumbled along, keeping up his heart by the reflection that every step brought him nearer to Lucy, and that he carried with him enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their journey.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35579' title='35579'>He had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left them. </span>
<span sid='35580' title='35580'>Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs which bounded it. </span>
<span sid='35581' title='35581'>They must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously, for he had been absent nearly five hours. </span>
<span sid='35582' title='35582'>In the gladness of his heart he put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re-echo to a loud halloo as a signal that he was coming. </span>
<span sid='35583' title='35583'>He paused and listened for an answer. </span>
<span sid='35584' title='35584'>None came save his own cry, which clattered up the dreary, silent ravines, and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions. </span>
<span sid='35585' title='35585'>Again he shouted, even louder than before, and again no whisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time ago. </span>
<span sid='35586' title='35586'>A vague, nameless dread came over him, and he hurried onwards frantically, dropping the precious food in his agitation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35587' title='35587'>When he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where the fire had been lit. </span>
<span sid='35588' title='35588'>There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there, but it had evidently not been tended since his departure. </span>
<span sid='35589' title='35589'>The same dead silence still reigned all round. </span>
<span sid='35590' title='35590'>With his fears all changed to convictions, he hurried on. </span>
<span sid='35591' title='35591'>There was no living creature near the remains of the fire: animals, man, maiden, all were gone. </span>
<span sid='35592' title='35592'>It was only too clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during his absence - a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had left no traces behind it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35593' title='35593'>Bewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head spin round, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling. </span>
<span sid='35594' title='35594'>He was essentially a man of action, however, and speedily recovered from his temporary impotence. </span>
<span sid='35595' title='35595'>Seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the smouldering fire, he blew it into a flame, and proceeded with its help to examine the little camp. </span>
<span sid='35596' title='35596'>The ground was all stamped down by the feet of horses, showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken the fugitives, and the direction of their tracks proved that they had afterwards turned back to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Salt Lake City&t=h'>Salt Lake City</a>. </span>
<span sid='35597' title='35597'>Had they carried back both of his companions with them? </span>
<span sid='35598' title='35598'>Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself that they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object which made every nerve of his body tingle within him. </span>
<span sid='35599' title='35599'>A little way on one side of the camp was a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had assuredly not been there before. </span>
<span sid='35600' title='35600'>There was no mistaking it for anything but a newly-dug grave. </span>
<span sid='35601' title='35601'>As the young hunter approached it, he perceived that a stick had been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft fork of it. </span>
<span sid='35602' title='35602'>The inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the point:</span>
<p>
<span sid='35603' title='35603'>JOHN FERRIER</span>
<p>
<span sid='35604' title='35604'>Formerly of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Salt Lake City&t=h'>Salt Lake City</a></span>
<p>
<span sid='35605' title='35605'>Died August 4th</span>
<p>
<span sid='35606' title='35606'>The sturdy old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was gone, then, and this was all his epitaph. </span>
<span sid='35607' title='35607'>Jefferson Hope looked wildly round to see if there was a second grave, but there was no sign of one. </span>
<span sid='35608' title='35608'>Lucy had been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original destiny, by becoming one of the harem of the Elder's son. </span>
<span sid='35609' title='35609'>As the young fellow realized the certainty of her fate, and his own powerlessness to prevent it, he wished that he, too, was lying with the old farmer in his last silent resting-place.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35610' title='35610'>Again, however, his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs from despair. </span>
<span sid='35611' title='35611'>If there was nothing else left to him, he could at least devote his life to revenge. </span>
<span sid='35612' title='35612'>With indomitable patience and perseverance, Jefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness, which he may have learned from the Indians amongst whom he had lived. </span>
<span sid='35613' title='35613'>As he stood by the desolate fire, he felt that the only one thing which could assuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution, brought by his own hand upon his enemies. </span>
<span sid='35614' title='35614'>His strong will and untiring energy should, he determined, be devoted to that one end. </span>
<span sid='35615' title='35615'>With a grim, white face, he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food, and having stirred up the smouldering fire, he cooked enough to last him for a few days. </span>
<span sid='35616' title='35616'>This he made up into a bundle, and, tired as he was, he set himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the avenging angels.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35617' title='35617'>For five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he had already traversed on horseback. </span>
<span sid='35618' title='35618'>At night he flung himself down among the rocks, and snatched a few hours of sleep; but before daybreak he was always well on his way. </span>
<span sid='35619' title='35619'>On the sixth day, he reached the Eagle CaÃ±on, from which they had commenced their ill-fated flight. </span>
<span sid='35620' title='35620'>Thence he could look down upon the home of the Saints. </span>
<span sid='35621' title='35621'>Worn and exhausted, he leaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent widespread city beneath him. </span>
<span sid='35622' title='35622'>As he looked at it, he observed that there were flags in some of the principal streets, and other signs of festivity. </span>
<span sid='35623' title='35623'>He was still speculating as to what this might mean when he heard the clatter of horse's hoofs, and saw a mounted man riding towards him. </span>
<span sid='35624' title='35624'>As he approached, he recognized him as a Mormon named Cowper, to whom he had rendered services at different times. </span>
<span sid='35625' title='35625'>He therefore accosted him when he got up to him, with the object of finding out what Lucy Ferrier's fate had been.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35626' title='35626'>'I am Jefferson Hope,' he said. </span>
<span sid='35627' title='35627'>'You remember me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35628' title='35628'>The Mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishment  - indeed, it was difficult to recognize in this tattered, unkempt wanderer, with ghastly white face and fierce, wild eyes, the spruce young hunter of former days. </span>
<span sid='35629' title='35629'>Having, however, at last satisfied himself as to his identity, the man's surprise changed to consternation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35630' title='35630'>'You are mad to come here,' he cried. </span>
<span sid='35631' title='35631'>'It is as much as my own life is worth to be seen talking with you. </span>
<span sid='35632' title='35632'>There is a warrant against you from the Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35633' title='35633'>'I don't fear them, or their warrant,' Hope said, earnestly. </span>
<span sid='35634' title='35634'>'You must know something of this matter, Cowper. </span>
<span sid='35635' title='35635'>I conjure you by everything you hold dear to answer a few questions. </span>
<span sid='35636' title='35636'>We have always been friends. </span>
<span sid='35637' title='35637'>For God's sake, don't refuse to answer me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35638' title='35638'>'What is it?' the Mormon asked uneasily. </span>
<span sid='35639' title='35639'>'Be quick. </span>
<span sid='35640' title='35640'>The very rocks have ears and the trees eyes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35641' title='35641'>'What has become of Lucy Ferrier?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35642' title='35642'>'She was married yesterday to young Drebber. </span>
<span sid='35643' title='35643'>Hold up, man, hold up; you have no life left in you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35644' title='35644'>'Don't mind me,' said Hope faintly. </span>
<span sid='35645' title='35645'>He was white to the very lips, and had sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning. </span>
<span sid='35646' title='35646'>'Married you say?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35647' title='35647'>'Married yesterday - that's what those flags are for on the Endowment House. </span>
<span sid='35648' title='35648'>There was some words between young Drebber and young Stangerson as to which was to have her. </span>
<span sid='35649' title='35649'>They'd both been in the party that followed them, and Stangerson had shot her father, which seemed to give him the best claim; but when they argued it out in council, Drebber's party was the stronger, so the Prophet gave her over to him. </span>
<span sid='35650' title='35650'>No one won't have her very long though, for I saw death in her face yesterday. </span>
<span sid='35651' title='35651'>She is more like a ghost than a woman. </span>
<span sid='35652' title='35652'>Are you off, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35653' title='35653'>'Yes, I am off,' said Jefferson Hope, who had risen from his seat. </span>
<span sid='35654' title='35654'>His face might have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was its expression, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35655' title='35655'>'Where are you going?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35656' title='35656'>'Never mind,' he answered; and, slinging his weapon over his shoulder, strode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains to the haunts of the wild beasts. </span>
<span sid='35657' title='35657'>Amongst them all there was none so fierce and so dangerous as himself.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35658' title='35658'>The prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled. </span>
<span sid='35659' title='35659'>Whether it was the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage into which she had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her head again, but pined away and died within a month. </span>
<span sid='35660' title='35660'>Her sottish husband, who had married her principally for the sake of John Ferrier's property, did not affect any great grief at his bereavement; but his other wives mourned over her, and sat up with her the night before the burial, as is the Mormon custom. </span>
<span sid='35661' title='35661'>They were grouped round the bier in the early hours of the morning, when, to their inexpressible fear and astonishment, the door was flung open, and a savage-looking, weather-beaten man in tattered garments strode into the room. </span>
<span sid='35662' title='35662'>Without a glance or a word to the cowering women, he walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the pure soul of Lucy Ferrier. </span>
<span sid='35663' title='35663'>Stooping over her, he pressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead, and then, snatching up her hand, he took the wedding-ring from her finger. </span>
<span sid='35664' title='35664'>'She shall not be buried in that,' he cried with a fierce snarl, and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and was gone. </span>
<span sid='35665' title='35665'>So strange and so brief was the episode that the watchers might have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other people of it, had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35666' title='35666'>For some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading a strange wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for vengeance which possessed him. </span>
<span sid='35667' title='35667'>Tales were told in the city of the weird figure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which haunted the lonely mountain gorges. </span>
<span sid='35668' title='35668'>Once a bullet whistled through Stangerson's window and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him. </span>
<span sid='35669' title='35669'>On another occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great boulder crashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by throwing himself upon his face. </span>
<span sid='35670' title='35670'>The two young Mormons were not long in discovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives and led repeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or killing their enemy, but always without success. </span>
<span sid='35671' title='35671'>Then they adopted the precaution of never going out alone or after night-fall, and of having their houses guarded. </span>
<span sid='35672' title='35672'>After a time they were able to relax these measures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent, and they hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35673' title='35673'>Far from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. </span>
<span sid='35674' title='35674'>The hunter's mind was of a hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of revenge had taken such complete possession of it that there was no room for any other emotion. </span>
<span sid='35675' title='35675'>He was, however, above all things, practical. </span>
<span sid='35676' title='35676'>He soon realized that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant strain which he was putting upon it. </span>
<span sid='35677' title='35677'>Exposure and want of wholesome food were wearing him out. </span>
<span sid='35678' title='35678'>If he died like a dog among the mountains, what was to become of his revenge then? </span>
<span sid='35679' title='35679'>And yet such a death was sure to overtake him if he persisted. </span>
<span sid='35680' title='35680'>He felt that that was to play his enemy's game, so he reluctantly returned to the old <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Nevada&t=h'>Nevada</a> mines, there to recruit his health and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue his object without privation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35681' title='35681'>His intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a combination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the mines for nearly five. </span>
<span sid='35682' title='35682'>At the end of that time, however, his memory of his wrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on that memorable flight when he had stood by John Ferrier's grave. </span>
<span sid='35683' title='35683'>Disguised, and under an assumed name, he returned to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Salt Lake City&t=h'>Salt Lake City</a>, careless what became of his own life, as long as he obtained what he knew to be justice. </span>
<span sid='35684' title='35684'>There he found evil tidings awaiting him. </span>
<span sid='35685' title='35685'>There had been a schism among the Chosen People a few months before, some of the younger members of the Church having rebelled against the authority of the Elders, and the result had been the secession of a certain number of the malcontents, who had left <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Utah&t=h'>Utah</a> and become Gentiles. </span>
<span sid='35686' title='35686'>Among these had been Drebber and Stangerson; and no one knew whither they had gone. </span>
<span sid='35687' title='35687'>Rumour reported that Drebber had managed to convert a large part of his property into money, and that he had departed a wealthy man, while his companion, Stangerson, was comparatively poor. </span>
<span sid='35688' title='35688'>There was no clue at all, however, as to their whereabouts.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35689' title='35689'>Many a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought of revenge in the face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never faltered for a moment. </span>
<span sid='35690' title='35690'>With the small competence he possessed, eked out by such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to town through the United States in quest of his enemies. </span>
<span sid='35691' title='35691'>Year passed into year, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on, a human bloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object to which he had devoted his life. </span>
<span sid='35692' title='35692'>At last his perseverance was rewarded. </span>
<span sid='35693' title='35693'>It was but a glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told him that <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Cleveland&t=h'>Cleveland</a> in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ohio&t=h'>Ohio</a> possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of. </span>
<span sid='35694' title='35694'>He returned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all arranged. </span>
<span sid='35695' title='35695'>It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his window, had recognized the vagrant in the street, and had read murder in his eyes. </span>
<span sid='35696' title='35696'>He hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied by Stangerson, who had become his private secretary, and represented to him that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and hatred of an old rival. </span>
<span sid='35697' title='35697'>That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into custody, and not being able to find sureties, was detained for some weeks. </span>
<span sid='35698' title='35698'>When at last he was liberated it was only to find that Drebber's house was deserted, and that he and his secretary had departed for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35699' title='35699'>Again the avenger had been foiled, and again his concentrated hatred urged him to continue the pursuit. </span>
<span sid='35700' title='35700'>Funds were wanting, however, and for some time he had to return to work, saving every dollar for his approaching journey. </span>
<span sid='35701' title='35701'>At last, having collected enough to keep life in him, he departed for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>, and tracked his enemies from city to city, working his way in any menial capacity, but never overtaking the fugitives. </span>
<span sid='35702' title='35702'>When he reached St Petersburg, they had departed for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Paris&t=h'>Paris</a>; and when he followed them there, he learned that they had just set off for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Copenhagen&t=h'>Copenhagen</a>. </span>
<span sid='35703' title='35703'>At the Danish capital he was again a few days late, for they had journeyed on to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, where he at last succeeded in running them to earth. </span>
<span sid='35704' title='35704'>As to what occurred there, we cannot do better than quote the old hunter's own account, as duly recorded in Dr Watson's Journal, to which we are already under such obligations.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35705' title='35705'>CHAPTER 6: A Continuation of the Reminiscences of John Watson MD</span>
<p>
<span sid='35706' title='35706'>Our prisoner's furious resistance did not apparently indicate any ferocity in his disposition towards ourselves, for on finding himself powerless, he smiled in an affable manner, and expressed his hopes that he had not hurt any of us in the scuffle. </span>
<span sid='35707' title='35707'>'I guess you're going to take me to the police-station,' he remarked to Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='35708' title='35708'>'My cab's at the door. </span>
<span sid='35709' title='35709'>If you'll loose my legs I'll walk down to it. </span>
<span sid='35710' title='35710'>I'm not so light to lift as I used to be.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35711' title='35711'>Gregson and Lestrade exchanged glances, as if they thought this proposition rather a bold one; but Holmes at once took the prisoner at his word, and loosed the towel which he had bound round his ankles. </span>
<span sid='35712' title='35712'>He rose and stretched his legs, as though to assure himself that they were free once more. </span>
<span sid='35713' title='35713'>I remember that I thought to myself, as I eyed him, that I had seldom seen a more powerfully-built man; and his dark, sun-burned face bore an expression of determination and energy which was as formidable as his personal strength.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35714' title='35714'>'If there's a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon you are the man for it,' he said, gazing with undisguised admiration at my fellow-lodger. </span>
<span sid='35715' title='35715'>The way you kept on my trail was a caution.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35716' title='35716'>'You had better come with me,' said Holmes to the two detectives.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35717' title='35717'>'I can drive you,' said Lestrade.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35718' title='35718'>'Good, and Gregson can come inside with me. </span>
<span sid='35719' title='35719'>You, too, Doctor. </span>
<span sid='35720' title='35720'>You have taken an interest in the case, and may as well stick to us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35721' title='35721'>I assented gladly, and we all descended together. </span>
<span sid='35722' title='35722'>Our prisoner made no attempt at escape, but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his, and we followed him. </span>
<span sid='35723' title='35723'>Lestrade mounted the box, whipped up the horse, and brought us in a very short time to our destination. </span>
<span sid='35724' title='35724'>We were ushered into a small chamber, where a police inspector noted down our prisoner's name and the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged. </span>
<span sid='35725' title='35725'>The official was a white-faced, unemotional man, who went through his duties in a dull, mechanical way. </span>
<span sid='35726' title='35726'>The prisoner will be put before the magistrates in the course of the week,' he said; 'in the meantime, Mr Jefferson Hope, have you anything that you wish to say? </span>
<span sid='35727' title='35727'>I must warn you that your words will be taken down, and may be used against you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35728' title='35728'>'I've got a good deal to say,' our prisoner said slowly. </span>
<span sid='35729' title='35729'>'I want to tell you gentlemen all about it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35730' title='35730'>'Hadn't you better reserve that for your trial?' asked the inspector.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35731' title='35731'>'I may never be tried,' he answered. </span>
<span sid='35732' title='35732'>'You needn't look startled. </span>
<span sid='35733' title='35733'>It isn't suicide I am thinking of. </span>
<span sid='35734' title='35734'>Are you a doctor?' </span>
<span sid='35735' title='35735'>He turned his fierce dark eyes upon me as he asked this last question.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35736' title='35736'>'Yes, I am,' I answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35737' title='35737'>'Then put your hand here,' he said, with a smile, motioning with his manacled wrists towards his chest.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35738' title='35738'>I did so; and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing and commotion which was going on inside. </span>
<span sid='35739' title='35739'>The walls of his chest seemed to thrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside which some powerful engine was at work. </span>
<span sid='35740' title='35740'>In the silence of the room I could hear a dull humming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same source.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35741' title='35741'>'Why,' I cried, 'you have an aortic aneurism!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35742' title='35742'>'That's what they call it,' he said, placidly. </span>
<span sid='35743' title='35743'>'I went to a doctor last week about it, and he told me that it is bound to burst before many days passed. </span>
<span sid='35744' title='35744'>It has been getting worse for years. </span>
<span sid='35745' title='35745'>I got it from over-exposure and under-feeding among the Salt Lake Mountains. </span>
<span sid='35746' title='35746'>I've done my work now, and I don't care how soon I go, but I should like to leave an account of the business behind me. </span>
<span sid='35747' title='35747'>I don't want to be remembered as a common cut-throat.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35748' title='35748'>The inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to the advisability of allowing him to tell his story.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35749' title='35749'>'Do you consider, Doctor, that there is immediate danger?' the former asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35750' title='35750'>'Most certainly there is,' I answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35751' title='35751'>'In that case it is clearly our duty, in the interests of justice, to take his statement,' said the inspector. </span>
<span sid='35752' title='35752'>'You are at liberty, sir, to give your account, which I again warn you will be taken down.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35753' title='35753'>'I'll sit down, with your leave,' the prisoner said, suiting the action to the word. </span>
<span sid='35754' title='35754'>'This aneurism of mine makes me easily tired, and the tussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters. </span>
<span sid='35755' title='35755'>I'm on the brink of the grave, and I am not likely to lie to you. </span>
<span sid='35756' title='35756'>Every word I say is the absolute truth, and how you use it is a matter of no consequence to me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35757' title='35757'>With these words, Jefferson Hope leaned back in his chair and began the following remarkable statement. </span>
<span sid='35758' title='35758'>He spoke in a calm and methodical manner, as though the events which he narrated were commonplace enough. </span>
<span sid='35759' title='35759'>I can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account, for I have had access to Lestrade's note-book, in which the prisoner's words were taken down exactly as they were uttered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35760' title='35760'>'It don't much matter to you why I hated these men,' he said; 'it's enough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings - a father and a daughter - and that they had, therefore, forfeited their own lives. </span>
<span sid='35761' title='35761'>After the lapse of time that has passed since their crime, it was impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court. </span>
<span sid='35762' title='35762'>I knew of their guilt though, and I determined that I should be judge, jury and executioner all rolled into one. </span>
<span sid='35763' title='35763'>You'd have done the same, if you have any manhood in you, if you had been in my place.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35764' title='35764'>'That girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago. </span>
<span sid='35765' title='35765'>She was forced into marrying that same Drebber, and broke her heart over it. </span>
<span sid='35766' title='35766'>I took the marriage ring from her dead finger, and I vowed that his dying eyes should rest upon that very ring, and that his last thoughts should be of the crime for which he was punished. </span>
<span sid='35767' title='35767'>I have carried it about with me, and have followed him and his accomplice over two continents until I caught them. </span>
<span sid='35768' title='35768'>They thought to tire me out, but they could not do it. </span>
<span sid='35769' title='35769'>If I die tomorrow, as is likely enough, I die knowing that my work in this world is done, and well done. </span>
<span sid='35770' title='35770'>They have perished, and by my hand. </span>
<span sid='35771' title='35771'>There is nothing left for me to hope for, or to desire.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35772' title='35772'>'They were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me to follow them. </span>
<span sid='35773' title='35773'>When I got to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> my pocket was about empty, and I found that I must turn my hand to something for my living. </span>
<span sid='35774' title='35774'>Driving and riding are as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a cab-owner's office, and soon got employment. </span>
<span sid='35775' title='35775'>I was to bring a certain sum a week to the owner, and whatever was over that I might keep for myself. </span>
<span sid='35776' title='35776'>There was seldom much over, but I managed to scrape along somehow. </span>
<span sid='35777' title='35777'>The hardest job was to learn my way about, for I reckon that of all the mazes that ever were contrived, this city is the most confusing. </span>
<span sid='35778' title='35778'>I had a map beside me though, and when once I had spotted the principal hotels and stations, I got on pretty well.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35779' title='35779'>'It was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were living; but I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across them. </span>
<span sid='35780' title='35780'>They were at a boarding-house at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Camberwell&t=h'>Camberwell</a>, over on the other side of the river. </span>
<span sid='35781' title='35781'>When once I found them out, I knew that I had them at my mercy. </span>
<span sid='35782' title='35782'>I had grown my beard, and there was no chance of their recognizing me. </span>
<span sid='35783' title='35783'>I would dog them and follow them until I saw my opportunity. </span>
<span sid='35784' title='35784'>I was determined that they should not escape me again.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35785' title='35785'>'They were very near doing it for all that. </span>
<span sid='35786' title='35786'>Go where they would about <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, I was always at their heels. </span>
<span sid='35787' title='35787'>Sometimes I followed them on my cab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then they could not get away from me. </span>
<span sid='35788' title='35788'>It was only early in the morning or late at night that I could earn anything, so that I began to get behindhand with my employer. </span>
<span sid='35789' title='35789'>I did not mind that, however, as long as I could lay my hand upon the men I wanted.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35790' title='35790'>'They were very cunning, though. </span>
<span sid='35791' title='35791'>They must have thought that there was some chance of their being followed, for they would never go out alone, and never after night-fall. </span>
<span sid='35792' title='35792'>During two weeks I drove behind them every day, and never once saw them separate. </span>
<span sid='35793' title='35793'>Drebber himself was drunk half the time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping. </span>
<span sid='35794' title='35794'>I watched them late and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance; but I was not discouraged, for something told me that the hour had almost come. </span>
<span sid='35795' title='35795'>My only fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon and leave my work undone.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35796' title='35796'>'At last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as the street was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive up to their door. </span>
<span sid='35797' title='35797'>Presently some luggage was brought out and after a time Drebber and Stangerson followed it, and drove off. </span>
<span sid='35798' title='35798'>I whipped up my horse and kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at ease, for I feared that they were going to shift their quarters. </span>
<span sid='35799' title='35799'>At <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Euston Station&t=h'>Euston Station</a> they got out, and I left a boy to hold my horse and followed them on to the platform. </span>
<span sid='35800' title='35800'>I heard them ask for the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Liverpool&t=h'>Liverpool</a> train, and the guard answer that one had just gone, and there would not be another for some hours. </span>
<span sid='35801' title='35801'>Stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but Drebber was rather pleased than otherwise. </span>
<span sid='35802' title='35802'>I got so close to them in the bustle that I could hear every word that passed between them. </span>
<span sid='35803' title='35803'>Drebber said that he had a little business of his own to do, and that if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him. </span>
<span sid='35804' title='35804'>His companion remonstrated with him, and reminded him that they had resolved to stick together. </span>
<span sid='35805' title='35805'>Drebber answered that the matter was a delicate one, and that he must go alone. </span>
<span sid='35806' title='35806'>I could not catch what Stangerson said to that, but the other burst out swearing, and reminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant, and that he must not presume to dictate to him. </span>
<span sid='35807' title='35807'>On that the secretary gave it up as a bad job, and simply bargained with him that if he missed the last train he should rejoin him at Halliday's Private Hotel; to which Drebber answered that he would be back on the platform before eleven, and made his way out of the station.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35808' title='35808'>'The moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. </span>
<span sid='35809' title='35809'>I had my enemies within my power. </span>
<span sid='35810' title='35810'>Together they could protect each other, but singly they were at my mercy. </span>
<span sid='35811' title='35811'>I did not act, however, with undue precipitation. </span>
<span sid='35812' title='35812'>My plans were already formed. </span>
<span sid='35813' title='35813'>There is no satisfaction in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that strikes him, and why retribution has come upon him. </span>
<span sid='35814' title='35814'>I had my plans arranged by which I should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out. </span>
<span sid='35815' title='35815'>It chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over some houses in the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a> Road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage. </span>
<span sid='35816' title='35816'>It was claimed that same evening, and returned; but in the interval I had taken a moulding of it, and had a duplicate constructed. </span>
<span sid='35817' title='35817'>By means of this I had access to at least one spot in this great city where I could rely upon being free from interruption. </span>
<span sid='35818' title='35818'>How to get Drebber to that house was the difficult problem which I had now to solve.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35819' title='35819'>'He walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops, staying for nearly half an hour in the last of them. </span>
<span sid='35820' title='35820'>When he came out, he staggered in his walk, and was evidently pretty well on. </span>
<span sid='35821' title='35821'>There was a hansom just in front of me, and he hailed it. </span>
<span sid='35822' title='35822'>I followed it so close that the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the whole way. </span>
<span sid='35823' title='35823'>We rattled across <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Waterloo Bridge&t=h'>Waterloo Bridge</a> and through miles of streets, until, to my astonishment, we found ourselves back in the terrace in which he had boarded. </span>
<span sid='35824' title='35824'>I could not imagine what his intention was in returning there; but I went on and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or so from the house. </span>
<span sid='35825' title='35825'>He entered it, and his hansom drove away. </span>
<span sid='35826' title='35826'>Give me a glass of water, if you please. </span>
<span sid='35827' title='35827'>My mouth gets dry with the talking.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35828' title='35828'>I handed him the glass, and he drank it down.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35829' title='35829'>'That's better,' he said. </span>
<span sid='35830' title='35830'>'Well, I waited for a quarter of an hour, or more, when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside the house. </span>
<span sid='35831' title='35831'>Next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared, one of whom was Drebber, and the other was a young man whom I had never seen before. </span>
<span sid='35832' title='35832'>This fellow had Drebber by the collar, and when they came to the head of the steps he gave him a shove and a kick which sent him half across the road. </span>
<span sid='35833' title='35833'>"You hound!" he cried, shaking his stick at him; "I'll teach you to insult an honest girl!" </span>
<span sid='35834' title='35834'>He was so hot that I think he would have thrashed Drebber with his cudgel, only that the cur staggered away down the road as fast as his legs would carry him. </span>
<span sid='35835' title='35835'>He ran as far as the corner, and then seeing my cab, he hailed me and jumped in. </span>
<span sid='35836' title='35836'>"Drive me to Halliday's Private Hotel," said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35837' title='35837'>'When I had him fairly inside my cab, my heart jumped so with joy that I feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong. </span>
<span sid='35838' title='35838'>I drove along slowly, weighing in my own mind what it was best to do. </span>
<span sid='35839' title='35839'>I might take him right out into the country, and there in some deserted lane have my last interview with him. </span>
<span sid='35840' title='35840'>I had almost decided upon this, when he solved the problem for me. </span>
<span sid='35841' title='35841'>The craze for drink had seized him again, and he ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace. </span>
<span sid='35842' title='35842'>He went in, leaving word that I should wait for him. </span>
<span sid='35843' title='35843'>There he remained until closing time, and when he came out he was so far gone that I knew the game was in my own hands.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35844' title='35844'>'Don't imagine that I intended to kill him in cold blood. </span>
<span sid='35845' title='35845'>It would only have been rigid justice if I had done so, but I could not bring myself to do it. </span>
<span sid='35846' title='35846'>I had long determined that he should have a show for his life if he chose to take advantage of it. </span>
<span sid='35847' title='35847'>Among the many billets which I have filled in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a> during my wandering life, I was once janitor and sweeper-out of the laboratory at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=York&t=h'>York</a> College. </span>
<span sid='35848' title='35848'>One day the professor was lecturing on poisons, and he showed his students some alkaloid, as he called it, which he had extracted from some South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n arrow poison, and which was so powerful that the least grain meant instant death. </span>
<span sid='35849' title='35849'>I spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept, and when they were all gone, I helped myself to a little of it. </span>
<span sid='35850' title='35850'>I was a fairly good dispenser, so I worked this alkaloid into small, soluble pills, and each pill I put in a box with a similar pill made without the poison. </span>
<span sid='35851' title='35851'>I determined at the time that when I had my chance my gentlemen should each have a draw out of one of these boxes, while I ate the pill that remained. </span>
<span sid='35852' title='35852'>It would be quite as deadly and a good deal less noisy than firing across a handkerchief. </span>
<span sid='35853' title='35853'>From that day I had always my pill boxes about with me, and the time had now come when I was to use them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35854' title='35854'>'It was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blowing hard and raining in torrents. </span>
<span sid='35855' title='35855'>Dismal as it was outside, I was glad within - so glad that I could have shouted out from pure exultation. </span>
<span sid='35856' title='35856'>If any of you gentlemen have ever pined for a thing, and longed for it during twenty long years, and then suddenly found it within your reach you would understand my feelings. </span>
<span sid='35857' title='35857'>I lit a cigar, and puffed at it to steady my nerves, but my hands were trembling and my temples throbbing with excitement. </span>
<span sid='35858' title='35858'>As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier and sweet Lucy looking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me, just as plain as I see you all in this room. </span>
<span sid='35859' title='35859'>All the way they were ahead of me, one on each side of the horse, until I pulled up at the house in the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a> Road.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35860' title='35860'>'There was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the dripping of the rain. </span>
<span sid='35861' title='35861'>When I looked in at the window, I found Drebber all huddled together in a drunken sleep. </span>
<span sid='35862' title='35862'>I shook him by the arm, "It's time to get out," I said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35863' title='35863'>'"All right, cabby," said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35864' title='35864'>'I suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned, for he got out without another word, and followed me down the garden. </span>
<span sid='35865' title='35865'>I had to walk beside him to keep him steady, for he was still a little top-heavy. </span>
<span sid='35866' title='35866'>When we came to the door, I opened it, and led him into the front room. </span>
<span sid='35867' title='35867'>I give my word that all the way, the father and the daughter were walking in front of us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35868' title='35868'>'"It's infernally dark," said he, stamping about.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35869' title='35869'>'"We'll soon have a light," I said, striking a match and putting it to a wax candle which I had brought with me. </span>
<span sid='35870' title='35870'>"Now, Enoch Drebber," I continued, turning to him, and holding the light to my own face, "who am I?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='35871' title='35871'>'He gazed at me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then I saw a horror spring up in them, and convulse his whole features, which showed me that he knew me. </span>
<span sid='35872' title='35872'>He staggered back with a livid face, and I saw the perspiration break out upon his brow, while his teeth chattered in his head. </span>
<span sid='35873' title='35873'>At the sight I leaned my back against the door and laughed loud and long. </span>
<span sid='35874' title='35874'>I had always known that vengeance would be sweet, but I had never hoped for the contentment of soul which now possessed me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35875' title='35875'>'"You dog!" I said; "I have hunted you from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Salt Lake City&t=h'>Salt Lake City</a> to St Petersburg, and you have always escaped me. </span>
<span sid='35876' title='35876'>Now, at last your wanderings have come to an end, for either you or I shall never see tomorrow's sun rise." </span>
<span sid='35877' title='35877'>He shrunk still farther away as I spoke, and I could see on his face that he thought I was mad. </span>
<span sid='35878' title='35878'>So I was for the time. </span>
<span sid='35879' title='35879'>The pulses in my temples beat like sledge-hammers, and I believe I would have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not gushed from my nose and relieved me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35880' title='35880'>'"What do you think of Lucy Ferrier now?" I cried, locking the door, and shaking the key in his face. </span>
<span sid='35881' title='35881'>"Punishment has been slow in coming, but it has overtaken you at last." </span>
<span sid='35882' title='35882'>I saw his coward lips tremble as I spoke. </span>
<span sid='35883' title='35883'>He would have begged for his life, but he knew well that it was useless.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35884' title='35884'>'"Would you murder me?" he stammered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35885' title='35885'>'"There is no murder," I answered. </span>
<span sid='35886' title='35886'>"Who talks of murdering a mad dog? </span>
<span sid='35887' title='35887'>What mercy had you upon my poor darling, when you dragged her from her slaughtered father, and bore her away to your accursed and shameless harem."</span>
<p>
<span sid='35888' title='35888'>'"It was not I who killed her father," he cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35889' title='35889'>'"But it was you who broke her innocent heart," I shrieked, thrusting the box before him. </span>
<span sid='35890' title='35890'>"Let the high God judge between us. </span>
<span sid='35891' title='35891'>Choose and eat. </span>
<span sid='35892' title='35892'>There is death in one and life in the other. </span>
<span sid='35893' title='35893'>I shall take what you leave. </span>
<span sid='35894' title='35894'>Let us see if there is justice upon the earth, or if we are ruled by chance."</span>
<p>
<span sid='35895' title='35895'>'He cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy, but I drew my knife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me. </span>
<span sid='35896' title='35896'>Then I swallowed the other, and we stood facing one another in silence for a minute or more, waiting to see which was to live and which was to die. </span>
<span sid='35897' title='35897'>Shall I ever forget the look which came over his face when the first warning pangs told him that the poison was in his system? </span>
<span sid='35898' title='35898'>I laughed as I saw it, and held Lucy's marriage ring in front of his eyes. </span>
<span sid='35899' title='35899'>It was but for a moment, for the action of the alkaloid is rapid. </span>
<span sid='35900' title='35900'>A spasm of pain contorted his features; he threw his hands out in front of him, staggered, and then, with a hoarse cry, fell heavily upon the floor. </span>
<span sid='35901' title='35901'>I turned him over with my foot, and placed my hand upon his heart. </span>
<span sid='35902' title='35902'>There was no movement. </span>
<span sid='35903' title='35903'>He was dead!</span>
<p>
<span sid='35904' title='35904'>'The blood had been streaming from my nose, but I had taken no notice of it. </span>
<span sid='35905' title='35905'>I don't know what it was that put it into my head to write upon the wall with it. </span>
<span sid='35906' title='35906'>Perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the police upon a wrong track, for I felt light-hearted and cheerful. </span>
<span sid='35907' title='35907'>I remembered a German being found in New <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=York&t=h'>York</a> with RACHE written up above him, and it was argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret societies must have done it. </span>
<span sid='35908' title='35908'>I guessed that what puzzled the New <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=York&t=h'>York</a>ers would puzzle the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>ers, so I dipped my finger in my own blood and printed it on a convenient place on the wall. </span>
<span sid='35909' title='35909'>Then I walked down to my cab and found that there was nobody about, and that the night was still very wild. </span>
<span sid='35910' title='35910'>I had driven some distance, when I put my hand into the pocket in which I usually kept Lucy's ring, and found that it was not there. </span>
<span sid='35911' title='35911'>I was thunderstruck at this, for it was the only memento that I had of her. </span>
<span sid='35912' title='35912'>Thinking that I might have dropped it when I stooped over Drebber's body, I drove back, and leaving my cab in a side street, I went boldly up to the house - for I was ready to dare anything rather than lose the ring. </span>
<span sid='35913' title='35913'>When I arrived there, I walked right into the arms of a police-officer who was coming out, and only managed to disarm his suspicions by pretending to be hopelessly drunk.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35914' title='35914'>'That was how Enoch Drebber came to his end. </span>
<span sid='35915' title='35915'>All I had to do then was to do as much for Stangerson, and so pay off John Ferrier's debt. </span>
<span sid='35916' title='35916'>I knew that he was staying at Halliday's Private Hotel, and I hung about all day, but he never came out. </span>
<span sid='35917' title='35917'>I fancy that he suspected something when Drebber failed to put in an appearance. </span>
<span sid='35918' title='35918'>He was cunning, was Stangerson, and always on his guard. </span>
<span sid='35919' title='35919'>If he thought he could keep me off by staying indoors he was very much mistaken. </span>
<span sid='35920' title='35920'>I soon found out which was the window of his bed-room, and early next morning I took advantage of some ladders which were lying in the lane behind the hotel, and so made my way into his room in the grey of the dawn. </span>
<span sid='35921' title='35921'>I woke him up and told him that the hour had come when he was to answer for the life he had taken so long before. </span>
<span sid='35922' title='35922'>I described Drebber's death to him, and I gave him the same choice of the poisoned pills. </span>
<span sid='35923' title='35923'>Instead of grasping at the chance of safety which that offered him, he sprang from his bed and flew at my throat. </span>
<span sid='35924' title='35924'>In self-defence I stabbed him to the heart. </span>
<span sid='35925' title='35925'>It would have been the same in any case, for Providence would never have allowed his guilty hand to pick out anything but the poison.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35926' title='35926'>'I have little more to say and it's as well, for I am about done up. </span>
<span sid='35927' title='35927'>I went on cabbing it for a day or so, intending to keep at it until I could save enough to take me back to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>. </span>
<span sid='35928' title='35928'>I was standing in the yard when a ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there called Jefferson Hope, and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at 221B, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='35929' title='35929'>I went round suspecting no harm, and the next thing I knew, this young man here had the bracelets on my wrists, and as neatly shackled as ever I saw in my life. </span>
<span sid='35930' title='35930'>That's the whole of my story, gentlemen. </span>
<span sid='35931' title='35931'>You may consider me to be a murderer; but I hold that I am just as much an officer of justice as you are.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35932' title='35932'>So thrilling had the man's narrative been and his manner was so impressive that we had sat silent and absorbed. </span>
<span sid='35933' title='35933'>Even the professional detectives, blasÃ© as they were in every detail of crime, appeared to be keenly interested in the man's story. </span>
<span sid='35934' title='35934'>When he finished, we sat for some minutes in a stillness which was only broken by the scratching of Lestrade's pencil as he gave the finishing touches to his shorthand account.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35935' title='35935'>'There is only one point on which I should like a little more information,' Sherlock Holmes said at last. </span>
<span sid='35936' title='35936'>'Who was your accomplice who came for the ring which I advertised?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35937' title='35937'>The prisoner winked at my friend jocosely. </span>
<span sid='35938' title='35938'>'I can tell my own secrets,' he said, 'but I don't get other people into trouble. </span>
<span sid='35939' title='35939'>I saw your advertisement, and I thought it might be a plant, or it might be the ring which I wanted. </span>
<span sid='35940' title='35940'>My friend volunteered to go and see. </span>
<span sid='35941' title='35941'>I think you'll own he did it smartly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35942' title='35942'>'Not a doubt of that,' said Holmes heartily.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35943' title='35943'>'Now, gentlemen,' the inspector remarked, gravely, 'the forms of the law must be complied with. </span>
<span sid='35944' title='35944'>On Thursday the prisoner will be brought before the magistrates, and your attendance will be required. </span>
<span sid='35945' title='35945'>Until then I will be responsible for him.' </span>
<span sid='35946' title='35946'>He rang the bell as he spoke, and Jefferson Hope was led off by a couple of warders, while my friend and I made our way out of the station and took a cab back to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35947' title='35947'>CHAPTER 7: The Conclusion</span>
<p>
<span sid='35948' title='35948'>We had all been warned to appear before the magistrates upon the Thursday; but when the Thursday came there was no occasion for our testimony. </span>
<span sid='35949' title='35949'>A higher Judge had taken the matter in hand, and Jefferson Hope had been summoned before a tribunal where strict justice would be meted out to him. </span>
<span sid='35950' title='35950'>On the very night after his capture the aneurism burst, and he was found in the morning stretched upon the floor of the cell, with a placid smile upon his face, as though he had been able in his dying moments to look back upon a useful life, and on work well done.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35951' title='35951'>'Gregson and Lestrade will be wild about his death,' Holmes remarked, as we chatted it over next evening. </span>
<span sid='35952' title='35952'>'Where will their grand advertisement be now?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35953' title='35953'>'I don't see that they had very much to do with his capture,' I answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35954' title='35954'>'What you do in this world is a matter of no consequence: returned my companion, bitterly. </span>
<span sid='35955' title='35955'>'The question is, what can you make people believe that you have done. </span>
<span sid='35956' title='35956'>Never mind,' he continued, more brightly, after a pause. </span>
<span sid='35957' title='35957'>'I would not have missed the investigation for anything. </span>
<span sid='35958' title='35958'>There has been no better case within my recollection. </span>
<span sid='35959' title='35959'>Simple as it was, there were several most instructive points about it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35960' title='35960'>'Simple!' I ejaculated.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35961' title='35961'>'Well, really, it can hardly be described as otherwise,' said Sherlock Holmes, smiling at my surprise. </span>
<span sid='35962' title='35962'>'The proof of its intrinsic simplicity is, that without any help save a few very ordinary deductions I was able to lay my hand upon the criminal within three days.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35963' title='35963'>'That is true,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35964' title='35964'>'I have already explained to you that what is out of the common is usually a guide rather than a hindrance. </span>
<span sid='35965' title='35965'>In solving a problem of this sort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards. </span>
<span sid='35966' title='35966'>That is a very useful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not practise it much. </span>
<span sid='35967' title='35967'>In the every-day affairs of life it is more useful to reason forwards, and so the other comes to be neglected. </span>
<span sid='35968' title='35968'>There are fifty who can reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35969' title='35969'>'I confess,' said I, 'that I do not quite follow you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35970' title='35970'>'I hardly expected that you would. </span>
<span sid='35971' title='35971'>Let me see if I can make it clearer. </span>
<span sid='35972' title='35972'>Most people, if you describe a train of events to them, will tell you what the result would be. </span>
<span sid='35973' title='35973'>They can put those events together in their minds, and argue from them that something will come to pass. </span>
<span sid='35974' title='35974'>There are few people, however, who, if you told them a result, would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result. </span>
<span sid='35975' title='35975'>This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoning backwards, or analytically.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='35976' title='35976'>'I understand,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35977' title='35977'>'Now this was a case in which you were given the result and had to find everything else for yourself. </span>
<span sid='35978' title='35978'>Now let me endeavour to show you the different steps in my reasoning. </span>
<span sid='35979' title='35979'>To begin at the beginning. </span>
<span sid='35980' title='35980'>I approached the house, as you know, on foot, and with my mind entirely free from all impressions. </span>
<span sid='35981' title='35981'>I naturally began by examining the roadway, and there, as I have already explained to you, I saw clearly the marks of a cab, which, I ascertained by inquiry, must have been there during the night. </span>
<span sid='35982' title='35982'>I satisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private carriage by the narrow gauge of the wheels. </span>
<span sid='35983' title='35983'>The ordinary <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> growler is considerably less wide than a gentleman's brougham.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35984' title='35984'>'This was the first point gained. </span>
<span sid='35985' title='35985'>I then walked slowly down the garden path, which happened to be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly suitable for taking impressions. </span>
<span sid='35986' title='35986'>No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush, but to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning. </span>
<span sid='35987' title='35987'>There is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps. </span>
<span sid='35988' title='35988'>Happily, I have always laid great stress upon it, and much practice has made it second nature to me. </span>
<span sid='35989' title='35989'>I saw the heavy footmarks of the constables, but I saw also the track of the two men who had first passed through the garden. </span>
<span sid='35990' title='35990'>It was easy to tell that they had been before the others, because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them. </span>
<span sid='35991' title='35991'>In this way my second link was formed, which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number, one remarkable for his height (as I calculated from the length of his stride) and the other fashionably dressed, to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his boots.</span>
<p>
<span sid='35992' title='35992'>'On entering the house this last inference was confirmed. </span>
<span sid='35993' title='35993'>My well-booted man lay before me. </span>
<span sid='35994' title='35994'>The tall one, then, had done the murder, if murder there was. </span>
<span sid='35995' title='35995'>There was no wound upon the dead man's person, but the agitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen his fate before it came upon him. </span>
<span sid='35996' title='35996'>Men who die from heart disease, or any sudden natural cause, never by any chance exhibit agitation upon their features. </span>
<span sid='35997' title='35997'>Having sniffed the dead man's lips, I detected a slightly sour smell, and I came to the conclusion that he had had poison forced upon him. </span>
<span sid='35998' title='35998'>Again, I argued that it had been forced upon him from the hatred and fear expressed upon his face. </span>
<span sid='35999' title='35999'>By the method of exclusion, I had arrived at this result, for no other hypothesis would meet the facts. </span>
<span sid='36000' title='36000'>Do not imagine that it was a very unheard-of idea. </span>
<span sid='36001' title='36001'>The forcible administration of poison is by no means a new thing in criminal annals. </span>
<span sid='36002' title='36002'>The cases of Dolsky in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Odessa&t=h'>Odessa</a>, and of Leturier in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Montpellier&t=h'>Montpellier</a>, will occur at once to any toxicologist.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36003' title='36003'>'And now came the great question as to the reason why. </span>
<span sid='36004' title='36004'>Robbery had not been the object of the murder, for nothing was taken. </span>
<span sid='36005' title='36005'>Was it politics, then, or was it a woman? </span>
<span sid='36006' title='36006'>That was the question which confronted me. </span>
<span sid='36007' title='36007'>I was inclined from the first to the latter supposition. </span>
<span sid='36008' title='36008'>Political assassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly. </span>
<span sid='36009' title='36009'>This murder had, on the contrary, been done most deliberately, and the perpetrator had left his tracks all over the room, showing that he had been there all the time. </span>
<span sid='36010' title='36010'>It must have been a private wrong, and not a political one, which called for such a methodical revenge. </span>
<span sid='36011' title='36011'>When the inscription was discovered upon the wall, I was more inclined than ever to my opinion. </span>
<span sid='36012' title='36012'>The thing was too evidently a blind. </span>
<span sid='36013' title='36013'>When the ring was found, however, it settled the question. </span>
<span sid='36014' title='36014'>Clearly the murderer had used it to remind his victim of some dead or absent woman. </span>
<span sid='36015' title='36015'>It was at this point that I asked Gregson whether he had inquired in his telegram to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Cleveland&t=h'>Cleveland</a> as to any particular point in Mr Drebber's former career. </span>
<span sid='36016' title='36016'>He answered, you remember, in the negative.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36017' title='36017'>'I then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room, which confirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer's height, and furnished me with the additional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the length of his nails. </span>
<span sid='36018' title='36018'>I had already come to the conclusion, since there were no signs of a struggle, that the blood which covered the floor had burst from the murderer's nose in his excitement. </span>
<span sid='36019' title='36019'>I could perceive that the track of blood coincided with the track of his feet. </span>
<span sid='36020' title='36020'>It is seldom that any man, unless he is very full-blooded, breaks out in this way through emotion, so I hazarded the opinion that the criminal was probably a robust and ruddy-faced man. </span>
<span sid='36021' title='36021'>Events proved that I had judged correctly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36022' title='36022'>'Having left the house, I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected. </span>
<span sid='36023' title='36023'>I telegraphed to the head of the police at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Cleveland&t=h'>Cleveland</a>, limiting my inquiry to the circumstances connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber. </span>
<span sid='36024' title='36024'>The answer was conclusive. </span>
<span sid='36025' title='36025'>It told me that Drebber had already applied for the protection of the law against an old rival in love, named Jefferson Hope, and that this same Hope was at present in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>. </span>
<span sid='36026' title='36026'>I knew now that I held the clue to the mystery in my hand, and all that remained was to secure the murderer.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36027' title='36027'>'I had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked into the house with Drebber was none other than the man who had driven the cab. </span>
<span sid='36028' title='36028'>The marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered on in a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in charge of it. </span>
<span sid='36029' title='36029'>Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were inside the house? </span>
<span sid='36030' title='36030'>Again, it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry out a deliberate crime under the very eyes, as it were, of a third person, who was sure to betray him. </span>
<span sid='36031' title='36031'>Lastly, supposing one man wished to dog another through <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, what better means could be adopt than to turn cab-driver. </span>
<span sid='36032' title='36032'>All these considerations led me to the irresistible conclusion that Jefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys of the Metropolis.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36033' title='36033'>'If he had been one, there was no reason to believe that he had ceased to be. </span>
<span sid='36034' title='36034'>On the contrary, from his point of view, any sudden change would be likely to draw attention to himself. </span>
<span sid='36035' title='36035'>He would probably, for a time at least, continue to perform his duties. </span>
<span sid='36036' title='36036'>There was no reason to suppose that he was going under an assumed name. </span>
<span sid='36037' title='36037'>Why should he change his name in a country where no one knew his original one? </span>
<span sid='36038' title='36038'>I therefore organized my Street Arab detective corps, and sent them systematically to every cab proprietor in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> until they ferreted out the man that I wanted. </span>
<span sid='36039' title='36039'>How well they succeeded, and how quickly I took advantage of it, are still fresh in your recollection. </span>
<span sid='36040' title='36040'>The murder of Stangerson was an incident which was entirely unexpected, but which could hardly in any case have been prevented. </span>
<span sid='36041' title='36041'>Through it, as you know, I came into possession of the pills, the existence of which I had already surmised. </span>
<span sid='36042' title='36042'>You see, the whole thing is a chain of logical sequences without a break or flaw.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36043' title='36043'>'It is wonderful!' I cried. </span>
<span sid='36044' title='36044'>'Your merits should be publicly recognized. </span>
<span sid='36045' title='36045'>You should publish an account of the case. </span>
<span sid='36046' title='36046'>If you won't, I will for you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36047' title='36047'>'You may do what you like, Doctor,' he answered. </span>
<span sid='36048' title='36048'>'See here!' he continued, handing a paper over to me, 'look at this!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36049' title='36049'>It was the Echo for the day, and the paragraph to which he pointed was devoted to the case in question.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36050' title='36050'>'The public,' it said, 'have lost a sensational treat through the sudden death of the man Hope, who was suspected of the murder of Mr Enoch Drebber and of Mr Joseph Stangerson. </span>
<span sid='36051' title='36051'>The details of the case will probably be never known now, though we are informed upon good authority that the crime was the result of an old-standing and romantic feud, in which love and Mormonism bore a part. </span>
<span sid='36052' title='36052'>It seems that both the victims belonged, in their younger days, to the Latter Day Saints, and Hope, the deceased prisoner, hails also from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Salt Lake City&t=h'>Salt Lake City</a>. </span>
<span sid='36053' title='36053'>If the case has had no other effect, it, at least, brings out in the most striking manner the efficiency of our detective police force, and will serve as a lesson to all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle their feuds at home, and not to carry them on to British soil. </span>
<span sid='36054' title='36054'>It is an open secret that the credit of this smart capture belongs entirely to the well-known <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a> officials, Messrs Lestrade and Gregson. </span>
<span sid='36055' title='36055'>The man was apprehended, it appears, in the rooms of a certain Mr Sherlock Holmes, who has himself, as an amateur, shown some talent in the detective line, and who, with such instructors, may hope in time to attain to some degree of their skill. </span>
<span sid='36056' title='36056'>It is expected that a testimonial of some sort will be presented to the two officers as a fitting recognition of their services.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36057' title='36057'>'Didn't I tell you so when we started?' cried Sherlock Holmes, with a laugh. </span>
