<h1><span sid='16561' title='16561'>The Adventure of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Reigate&t=h'>Reigate</a> Squire</span></h1>
<p class="subtitle">Arthur Conan Doyle<label for="sn-meta-reig" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-meta-reig" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><!--googleoff: all--><b>Story Number</b>: 21<br><b>Published in</b>: The Strand Magazine in June 1893<br><b>Collected in</b>: The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes<!--googleon: all--></span></p>
<p>
<span sid='16562' title='16562'>It was some time before the health of my friend, Mr Sherlock Holmes, recovered from the strain caused by his immense exertions in the spring of '87. </span>
<span sid='16563' title='16563'>The whole question of the Netherland-<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sumatra&t=h'>Sumatra</a> Company and of the colossal schemes of Baron Maupertuis is too recent in the minds of the public, and too intimately concerned with politics and finance, to be a fitting subject for this series of sketches. </span>
<span sid='16564' title='16564'>It led, however, in an indirect fashion to a singular and complex problem, which gave my friend an opportunity of demonstrating the value of a fresh weapon among the many with which he waged his life-long battle against crime.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16565' title='16565'>On referring to my notes, I see that it was on the 14th of April that I received a telegram from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lyons&t=h'>Lyons</a>, which informed me that Holmes was lying ill in the Hotel Dulong. </span>
<span sid='16566' title='16566'>Within twenty-four hours I was in his sick-room, and was relieved to find that there was nothing formidable in his symptoms. </span>
<span sid='16567' title='16567'>His iron constitution, however, had broken down under the strain of an investigation which had extended over two months, during which period he had never worked less than fifteen hours a day, and had more than once, as he assured, me, kept to his task for five days at a stretch. </span>
<span sid='16568' title='16568'>The triumphant issue of his labours could not save him from reaction after so terrible an exertion, and at a time when <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a> was ringing with his name and when his room was literally ankle-deep with congratulatory telegrams, I found him a prey to the blackest depression. </span>
<span sid='16569' title='16569'>Even the knowledge that he had succeeded where the police of three countries had failed, and that he had out-manoeuvred at every point the most accomplished swindler in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>, was insufficient to rouse him from his nervous prostration.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16570' title='16570'>Three days later we were back in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> together, but it was evident that my friend would be much the better for a change, and the thought of a week of spring-time in the country was full of attractions to me also. </span>
<span sid='16571' title='16571'>My old friend, Colonel Hayter, who had come under my professional care in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Afghanistan&t=h'>Afghanistan</a>, had now taken a house near <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Reigate&t=h'>Reigate</a>, in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Surrey&t=h'>Surrey</a>, and had frequently asked me to come down to him upon a visit. </span>
<span sid='16572' title='16572'>On the last occasion he had remarked that if my friend would only come with me, he would be glad to extend his hospitality to him also. </span>
<span sid='16573' title='16573'>A little diplomacy was needed, but when Holmes understood that the establishment was a bachelor one, and that he would be allowed the fullest freedom, he fell in with my plans, and a week after our return from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lyons&t=h'>Lyons</a> we were under the Colonel's roof. </span>
<span sid='16574' title='16574'>Hayter was a fine old soldier, who had seen much of the world, and he soon found, as I had expected, that Holmes and he had plenty in common.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16575' title='16575'>On the evening of our arrival we were sitting in the Colonel's gun-room after dinner, Holmes stretched upon the sofa, while Hayter and I looked over his little armoury of fire-arms.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16576' title='16576'>'By the way,' said he, suddenly, 'I'll take one of these pistols upstairs with me in case we have an alarm.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16577' title='16577'>'An alarm!' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16578' title='16578'>'Yes, we've had a scare in this part lately. </span>
<span sid='16579' title='16579'>Old Acton, who is one of our county magnates, had his house broken into last Monday. </span>
<span sid='16580' title='16580'>No great damage done, but the fellows are still at large.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16581' title='16581'>'No clue?' asked Holmes, cocking his eye at the Colonel.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16582' title='16582'>'None as yet. </span>
<span sid='16583' title='16583'>But the affair is a petty one, one of our little country crimes, which must seem too small for your attention, Mr Holmes, after this great international affair.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16584' title='16584'>Holmes waved away the compliment, though his smile showed that it had pleased him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16585' title='16585'>'Was there any feature of interest?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16586' title='16586'>'I fancy not. </span>
<span sid='16587' title='16587'>The thieves ransacked the library, and got very little for their pains. </span>
<span sid='16588' title='16588'>The whole place was turned upside down, drawers burst open and presses ransacked, with the result that an odd volume of Pope "Homer", two plated candlesticks, an ivory letter-weight, a small oak barometer, and a ball of twine are all that have vanished.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16589' title='16589'>'What an extraordinary assortment!' I exclaimed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16590' title='16590'>'Oh, the fellows evidently grabbed hold of anything they could get.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16591' title='16591'>Holmes grunted from the sofa.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16592' title='16592'>'The county police ought to make something of that,' said he. </span>
<span sid='16593' title='16593'>'Why, it is surely obvious that-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16594' title='16594'>But I held up a warning finger.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16595' title='16595'>'You are here for a rest, my dear fellow. </span>
<span sid='16596' title='16596'>For Heaven's sake, don't get started on a new problem when your nerves are all in shreds.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16597' title='16597'>Holmes shrugged his shoulders with a glance of comic resignation towards the Colonel, and the talk drifted away into less dangerous channels.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16598' title='16598'>It was destined, however, that all my professional caution should be wasted, for next morning the problem obtruded itself upon us in such a way that it was impossible to ignore it, and our country visit took a turn which neither of us could have anticipated. </span>
<span sid='16599' title='16599'>We were at breakfast when the Colonel's butler rushed in with all his propriety shaken out of him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16600' title='16600'>'Have you heard the news, sir?' he gasped. </span>
<span sid='16601' title='16601'>'At the Cunninghams', sir!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16602' title='16602'>'Burglary?' cried the Colonel, with his coffee cup in mid air.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16603' title='16603'>'Murder!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16604' title='16604'>The Colonel whistled. </span>
<span sid='16605' title='16605'>'By Jove!' said he, 'who's killed, then? </span>
<span sid='16606' title='16606'>The J.P., or his son?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16607' title='16607'>'Neither, sir. </span>
<span sid='16608' title='16608'>It was William, the coachman. </span>
<span sid='16609' title='16609'>Shot through the heart, sir, and never spoke again.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16610' title='16610'>'Who shot him, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16611' title='16611'>'The burglar, sir. </span>
<span sid='16612' title='16612'>He was off like a shot and got clean away. </span>
<span sid='16613' title='16613'>He'd just broke in at the pantry window when William came on him and met his end in saving his master's property.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16614' title='16614'>'What time?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16615' title='16615'>'It was last night, sir, somewhere about twelve.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16616' title='16616'>'Ah, then, we'll step over presently,' said the Colonel, coolly settling down to his breakfast again. </span>
<span sid='16617' title='16617'>'It's a baddish business,' he added, when the butler had gone. </span>
<span sid='16618' title='16618'>'He's our leading squire about here, is old Cunningham, and a very decent fellow, too. </span>
<span sid='16619' title='16619'>He'll be cut up over this, for the man has been in his service for years, and was a good servant. </span>
<span sid='16620' title='16620'>It's evidently the same villains who broke into Acton's.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16621' title='16621'>'And stole that very singular collection?' said Holmes, thoughtfully.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16622' title='16622'>'Precisely.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16623' title='16623'>'Hum! </span>
<span sid='16624' title='16624'>It may prove the simplest matter in the world; but, all the same, at first glance this is just a little curious, is it not? </span>
<span sid='16625' title='16625'>A gang of burglars acting in the country might be expected to vary the scene of their operations, and not to crack two cribs in the same district within a few days. </span>
<span sid='16626' title='16626'>When you spoke last night of taking precautions, I remember that it passed through my mind that this was probably the last parish in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> to which the thief or thieves would be likely to turn their attention; which shows that I have still much to learn.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16627' title='16627'>'I fancy it's some local practitioner,' said the Colonel. </span>
<span sid='16628' title='16628'>'In that case, of course, Acton's and Cunningham's are just the places he would go for, since they are far the largest about here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16629' title='16629'>'And richest?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16630' title='16630'>'Well, they ought to be; but they've had a law-suit for some years which has sucked the blood out of both of them, I fancy. </span>
<span sid='16631' title='16631'>Old Acton has some claim on half Cunningham's estate, and the lawyers have been at it with both hands.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16632' title='16632'>'If it's a local villain, there should not be much difficulty in running him down,' said Holmes, with a yawn. </span>
<span sid='16633' title='16633'>'All right, Watson, I don't intend to meddle.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16634' title='16634'>'Inspector Forrester, sir,' said the butler, throwing open the door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16635' title='16635'>The official, a smart, keen-faced young fellow, stepped into the room. </span>
<span sid='16636' title='16636'>'Good morning, Colonel,' said he. </span>
<span sid='16637' title='16637'>'I hope I don't intrude, but we hear that Mr Holmes, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>, is here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16638' title='16638'>The Colonel waved his hand towards my friend, and the Inspector bowed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16639' title='16639'>'We thought that perhaps you would care to step across, Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16640' title='16640'>'The Fates are against you, Watson,' said he, laughing. </span>
<span sid='16641' title='16641'>'We were chatting about the matter when you came in, Inspector. </span>
<span sid='16642' title='16642'>Perhaps you can let us have a few details.' </span>
<span sid='16643' title='16643'>As he leaned back in his chair in the familiar attitude, I knew that the case was hopeless.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16644' title='16644'>'We had no clue in the Acton affair. </span>
<span sid='16645' title='16645'>But here we have plenty to go on, and there's no doubt it is the same party in each case. </span>
<span sid='16646' title='16646'>The man was seen.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16647' title='16647'>'Ah!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16648' title='16648'>'Yes, sir. </span>
<span sid='16649' title='16649'>But he was off like a deer after the shot that killed poor William Kirwan was fired. </span>
<span sid='16650' title='16650'>Mr Cunningham saw him from the bedroom window, and Mr Alec Cunningham saw him from the back passage. </span>
<span sid='16651' title='16651'>It was a quarter to twelve when the alarm broke out. </span>
<span sid='16652' title='16652'>Mr Cunningham had just got into bed, and Mister Alec was smoking a pipe in his dressing-gown. </span>
<span sid='16653' title='16653'>They both heard William, the coachman, calling for help, and Mister Alec he ran down to see what was the matter. </span>
<span sid='16654' title='16654'>The back door was open, and as he came to the foot of the stairs he saw two men wrestling together outside. </span>
<span sid='16655' title='16655'>One of them fired a shot, the other dropped, and the murderer rushed across the garden and over the hedge. </span>
<span sid='16656' title='16656'>Mr Cunningham, looking out of his bedroom window, saw the fellow as he gained the road, but lost sight of him at once. </span>
<span sid='16657' title='16657'>Mister Alec stopped to see if he could help the dying man, and so the villain got clean away. </span>
<span sid='16658' title='16658'>Beyond the fact that he was a middle-sized man, and dressed in some dark stuff, we have no personal clue, but we are making energetic inquiries, and if he is a stranger we shall soon find him out.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16659' title='16659'>'What was this William doing there? </span>
<span sid='16660' title='16660'>Did he say anything before he died?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16661' title='16661'>'Not a word. </span>
<span sid='16662' title='16662'>He lives at the lodge with his mother, and as he was a very faithful fellow, we imagine that he walked up to the house with the intention of seeing that all was right there. </span>
<span sid='16663' title='16663'>Of course, this Acton business has put everyone on their guard. </span>
<span sid='16664' title='16664'>The robber must have just bust open the door-the lock has been forced - when William came upon him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16665' title='16665'>'Did William say anything to his mother before going out?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16666' title='16666'>'She is very old and deaf, and we can get no information from her. </span>
<span sid='16667' title='16667'>The shock has made her half-witted, but I understand that she was never very bright. </span>
<span sid='16668' title='16668'>There is one very important circumstance, however. </span>
<span sid='16669' title='16669'>Look at this!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16670' title='16670'>He took a small piece of torn paper from a note-book and spread it out upon his knee.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16671' title='16671'>'This was found between the finger and thumb of the dead man. </span>
<span sid='16672' title='16672'>It appears to be a fragment torn from a larger sheet. </span>
<span sid='16673' title='16673'>You will observe that the hour mentioned upon it is the very time at which the poor fellow met his fate. </span>
<span sid='16674' title='16674'>You see that his murderer might have torn the rest of the sheet from him or he might have taken this fragment from the murderer. </span>
<span sid='16675' title='16675'>It reads almost as though it was an appointment.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16676' title='16676'>Holmes took up the scrap of paper, a facsimile of which is here reproduced.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16677' title='16677'>'Presuming that it is an appointment,' continued the Inspector, 'it is, of course, a conceivable theory that this William Kirwan, although he had the reputation of being an honest man, may have been in league with the thief. </span>
<span sid='16678' title='16678'>He may have met him there, may even have helped him to break in the door, and then they may have fallen out between themselves.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16679' title='16679'>'This writing is of extraordinary interest,' said Holmes, who had been examining it with intense concentration. </span>
<span sid='16680' title='16680'>'These are much deeper waters than I had thought.' </span>
<span sid='16681' title='16681'>He sank his head upon his hands, while the Inspector smiled at the effect which his case had had upon the famous <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> specialist.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16682' title='16682'>'Your last remark,' said Holmes, presently, 'as to the possibility of there being an understanding between the burglar and the servant, and this being a note of appointment from one to the other, is an ingenious and not entirely an impossible supposition. </span>
<span sid='16683' title='16683'>But this writing opens up - </span>
<span sid='16684' title='16684'>'He sank his head into his hands again and remained for some minutes in the deepest thought. </span>
<span sid='16685' title='16685'>When he raised his face I was surprised to see that his cheek was tinged with colour, and his eyes as bright as before his illness. </span>
<span sid='16686' title='16686'>He sprang to his feet with all his old energy.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16687' title='16687'>'I'll tell you what!' said he. </span>
<span sid='16688' title='16688'>'I should like to have a quiet little glance into the details of this case. </span>
<span sid='16689' title='16689'>There is something in it which fascinates me extremely. </span>
<span sid='16690' title='16690'>If you will permit me, Colonel, I will leave my friend, Watson, and you, and I will step round with the Inspector to test the truth of one or two little fancies of mine. </span>
<span sid='16691' title='16691'>I will be with you again in half an hour.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16692' title='16692'>An hour and a half had elapsed before the Inspector returned alone.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16693' title='16693'>'Mr Holmes is walking up and down in the field outside,' said he. </span>
<span sid='16694' title='16694'>'He wants us all four to go up to the house together.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16695' title='16695'>'To Mr Cunningham's?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16696' title='16696'>'Yes, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16697' title='16697'>'What for?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16698' title='16698'>The Inspector shrugged his shoulders. </span>
<span sid='16699' title='16699'>'I don't quite know, sir. </span>
<span sid='16700' title='16700'>Between ourselves, I think Mr Holmes has not quite got over his illness yet. </span>
<span sid='16701' title='16701'>He's been behaving very queerly, and he is very much excited.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16702' title='16702'>'I don't think you need alarm yourself,' said I. </span>
<span sid='16703' title='16703'>'I have usually found that there was method in his madness.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16704' title='16704'>'Some folk might say there was madness in his method,' muttered the Inspector. </span>
<span sid='16705' title='16705'>'But he's all on fire to start, Colonel, so we had best go out, if you are ready.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16706' title='16706'>We found Holmes pacing up and down in the field, his chin sunk upon his breast, and his hands thrust into his trouser pockets.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16707' title='16707'>'The matter grows in interest,' said he. </span>
<span sid='16708' title='16708'>'Watson, your country trip has been a distinct success. </span>
<span sid='16709' title='16709'>I have had a charming morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16710' title='16710'>'You have been up to the scene of the crime, I understand?' said the Colonel.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16711' title='16711'>'Yes; the Inspector and I have made quite a little reconnaissance together.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16712' title='16712'>'Any success?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16713' title='16713'>'Well, we have seen some very interesting things. </span>
<span sid='16714' title='16714'>I'll tell you what we did as we walk. </span>
<span sid='16715' title='16715'>First of all we saw the body of this unfortunate man. </span>
<span sid='16716' title='16716'>He certainly died from a revolver wound, as reported.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16717' title='16717'>'Had you doubted it, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16718' title='16718'>'Oh, it is as well to test everything. </span>
<span sid='16719' title='16719'>Our inspection was not wasted. </span>
<span sid='16720' title='16720'>We then had an interview with Mr Cunningham and his son, who were able to point out the exact spot where the murderer had broken through the garden hedge in his flight. </span>
<span sid='16721' title='16721'>That was of great interest.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16722' title='16722'>'Naturally.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16723' title='16723'>'Then we had a look at this poor fellow's mother. </span>
<span sid='16724' title='16724'>We could get no information from her, however, as she is very old and feeble.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16725' title='16725'>'And what is the result of your investigations?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16726' title='16726'>'The conviction that the crime is a very peculiar one.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16727' title='16727'>Perhaps our visit now may do something to make it less obscure. </span>
<span sid='16728' title='16728'>I think that we are both agreed, Inspector, that the fragment of paper in the dead man's hand, bearing, as it does, the very hour of his death written upon it, is of extreme importance.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16729' title='16729'>'It should give a clue, Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16730' title='16730'>'It does give a clue. </span>
<span sid='16731' title='16731'>Whoever wrote that note was the man who brought William Kirwan out of his bed at that hour. </span>
<span sid='16732' title='16732'>But where is the rest of that sheet of paper?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16733' title='16733'>'I examined the ground carefully in the hope of finding it,' said the Inspector.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16734' title='16734'>'It was torn out of the dead man's hand. </span>
<span sid='16735' title='16735'>Why was someone so anxious to get possession of it? </span>
<span sid='16736' title='16736'>Because it incriminated him. </span>
<span sid='16737' title='16737'>And what would he do with it? </span>
<span sid='16738' title='16738'>Thrust it into his pocket most likely, never noticing that a corner of it had been left in the grip of the corpse. </span>
<span sid='16739' title='16739'>If we could get the rest of that sheet, it is obvious that we should have gone a long way towards solving the mystery.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16740' title='16740'>'Yes, but how can we get at the criminal's pocket before we catch the criminal?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16741' title='16741'>'Well, well, it was worth thinking over. </span>
<span sid='16742' title='16742'>Then there is another obvious point. </span>
<span sid='16743' title='16743'>The note was sent to William. </span>
<span sid='16744' title='16744'>The man who wrote it could not have taken it, otherwise of course he might have delivered his own message by word of mouth. </span>
<span sid='16745' title='16745'>Who brought the note, then? </span>
<span sid='16746' title='16746'>Or did it come through the post?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16747' title='16747'>'I have made inquiries,' said the Inspector. </span>
<span sid='16748' title='16748'>'William received a letter by the afternoon post yesterday. </span>
<span sid='16749' title='16749'>The envelope was destroyed by him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16750' title='16750'>'Excellent!' cried Holmes, clapping the Inspector on the back. </span>
<span sid='16751' title='16751'>'You've seen the postman. </span>
<span sid='16752' title='16752'>It is a pleasure to work with you. </span>
<span sid='16753' title='16753'>Well, here is the lodge, and if you will come up, Colonel, I will show you the scene of the crime.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16754' title='16754'>We passed the pretty cottage where the murdered man had lived, and walked up an oak-lined avenue to the fine old Queen Anne house, which bears the date of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Malplaquet&t=h'>Malplaquet</a> upon the lintel of the door. </span>
<span sid='16755' title='16755'>Holmes and the Inspector led us round it until we came to the side gate, which is separated by a stretch of garden from the hedge which lines the road. </span>
<span sid='16756' title='16756'>A constable was standing at the kitchen door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16757' title='16757'>'Throw the door open, officer,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='16758' title='16758'>'Now it was on those stairs that young Mr Cunningham stood and saw the two men struggling just where we are. </span>
<span sid='16759' title='16759'>Old Mr Cunningham was at that window - the second on the left - and he saw the fellow get away just to the left of that bush. </span>
<span sid='16760' title='16760'>So did the son. </span>
<span sid='16761' title='16761'>They are both sure of it, on account of the bush. </span>
<span sid='16762' title='16762'>Then Mister Alec ran out and knelt beside the wounded man. </span>
<span sid='16763' title='16763'>The ground is very hard, you see, and there are no marks to guide us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16764' title='16764'>As he spoke two men came down the garden path, from round the angle of the house. </span>
<span sid='16765' title='16765'>The one was an elderly man, with a strong, deep-lined, heavy-eyed face; the other a dashing young fellow, whose bright, smiling expression and showy dress were in strange contrast with the business which had brought us there.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16766' title='16766'>'Still at it, then?' said he to Holmes. </span>
<span sid='16767' title='16767'>'I thought you <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>ers were never at fault. </span>
<span sid='16768' title='16768'>You don't seem to be so very quick, after all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16769' title='16769'>'Ah! you must give us a little time,' said Holmes, good-humouredly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16770' title='16770'>'You'll want it,' said young Alec Cunningham. </span>
<span sid='16771' title='16771'>'Why, I don't see that we have any clue at all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16772' title='16772'>'There's only one,' answered the Inspector. </span>
<span sid='16773' title='16773'>'We thought that if we could only find - Good heavens! </span>
<span sid='16774' title='16774'>Mr Holmes, what is the matter?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16775' title='16775'>My poor friend's face had suddenly assumed the most dreadful expression. </span>
<span sid='16776' title='16776'>His eyes rolled upwards, his features writhed in agony, and with a suppressed groan he dropped on his face upon the ground. </span>
<span sid='16777' title='16777'>Horrified at the suddenness and severity of the attack, we carried him into the kitchen, where he lay back in a large chair and breathed heavily for some minutes. </span>
<span sid='16778' title='16778'>Finally, with a shame-faced apology for his weakness, he rose once more.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16779' title='16779'>'Watson would tell you that I have only just recovered from a severe illness,' he explained. </span>
<span sid='16780' title='16780'>'I am liable to these sudden nervous attacks.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16781' title='16781'>'Shall I send you home in my trap?' asked old Cunningham.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16782' title='16782'>'Well, since I am here there is one point on which I should like to feel sure. </span>
<span sid='16783' title='16783'>We can very easily verify it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16784' title='16784'>'What is it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16785' title='16785'>'Well, it seems to me that it is just possible that the arrival of this poor fellow William was not before but after the entrance of the burglar into the house. </span>
<span sid='16786' title='16786'>You appear to take it for granted that although the door was forced the robber never got in.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16787' title='16787'>'I fancy that is quite obvious,' said Mr Cunningham, gravely. </span>
<span sid='16788' title='16788'>'Why, my son Alec had not yet gone to bed, and he would certainly have heard anyone moving about.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16789' title='16789'>'Where was he sitting?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16790' title='16790'>'I was sitting smoking in my dressing-room.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16791' title='16791'>'Which window is that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16792' title='16792'>'The last on the left, next my father's.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16793' title='16793'>'Both your lamps were lit, of course?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16794' title='16794'>'Undoubtedly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16795' title='16795'>'There are some very singular points here,' said Holmes, smiling. </span>
<span sid='16796' title='16796'>'Is it not extraordinary that a burglar - and a burglar who had had some previous experience - should deliberately break into a house at a time when he could see from the lights that two of the family were still afoot?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16797' title='16797'>'He must have been a cool hand.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16798' title='16798'>'Well, of course, if the case were not an odd one we should not have been driven to ask you for an explanation,' said Mister Alec. </span>
<span sid='16799' title='16799'>'But as to your idea that the man had robbed the house before William tackled him, I think it a most absurd notion. </span>
<span sid='16800' title='16800'>Shouldn't we have found the place disarranged and missed the things which he had taken?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16801' title='16801'>'It depends on what the things were,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='16802' title='16802'>'You must remember that we are dealing with a burglar who is a very peculiar fellow, and who appears to work on lines of his own. </span>
<span sid='16803' title='16803'>Look, for example, at the queer lot of things which he took from Acton's - what was it? - a ball of string, a letter-weight, and I don't know what other odds and ends!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16804' title='16804'>'Well, we are quite in your hands, Mr Holmes,' said old Cunningham. </span>
<span sid='16805' title='16805'>'Anything which you or the Inspector may suggest will most certainly be done.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16806' title='16806'>'In the first place,' said Holmes, 'I should like you to offer a reward - coming from yourself, for the officials may take a little time before they would agree upon the sum, and these things cannot be done too promptly. </span>
<span sid='16807' title='16807'>I have jotted down the form here, if you would not mind signing it. </span>
<span sid='16808' title='16808'>Fifty pounds was quite enough, I thought.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16809' title='16809'>'I would willingly give five hundred,' said the J.P., taking the slip of paper and the pencil which Holmes handed to him. </span>
<span sid='16810' title='16810'>'This is not quite correct, however,' he added, glancing over the document.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16811' title='16811'>'I wrote it rather hurriedly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16812' title='16812'>'You see you begin: "Whereas, at about a quarter to one on Tuesday morning, an attempt was made" - and so on. </span>
<span sid='16813' title='16813'>It was at a quarter to twelve, as a matter of fact.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16814' title='16814'>I was pained at the mistake, for I knew how keenly Holmes would feel any slip of the kind. </span>
<span sid='16815' title='16815'>It was his speciality to be accurate as to fact, but his recent illness had shaken him, and this one little incident was enough to show me that he was still far from being himself. </span>
<span sid='16816' title='16816'>He was obviously embarrassed for an instant, while the Inspector raised his eyebrows and Alec Cunningham burst into a laugh. </span>
<span sid='16817' title='16817'>The old gentleman corrected the mistake, however, and handed the paper back to Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16818' title='16818'>'Get it printed as soon as possible,' he said. </span>
<span sid='16819' title='16819'>'I think your idea is an excellent one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16820' title='16820'>Holmes put the slip of paper carefully away in his pocketbook.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16821' title='16821'>'And now,' said he, 'it would really be a good thing that we should all go over the house together, and make certain that this rather erratic burglar did not, after all, carry anything away with him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16822' title='16822'>Before entering, Holmes made an examination of the door which had been forced. </span>
<span sid='16823' title='16823'>It was evident that a chisel or strong knife had been thrust in, and the lock forced back with it. </span>
<span sid='16824' title='16824'>We could see the marks in the wood where it had been pushed in.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16825' title='16825'>'You don't use bars, then?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16826' title='16826'>'We have never found it necessary.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16827' title='16827'>'You don't keep a dog?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16828' title='16828'>'Yes; but he is chained on the other side of the house.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16829' title='16829'>'When do the servants go to bed?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16830' title='16830'>'About ten.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16831' title='16831'>'I understand that William was usually in bed also at that hour?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16832' title='16832'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16833' title='16833'>'It is singular that on this particular night he should have been up. </span>
<span sid='16834' title='16834'>Now, I should be very glad if you would have the kindness to show us over the house, Mr Cunningham.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16835' title='16835'>A stone-flagged passage, with the kitchens branching away from it, led by a wooden staircase directly to the first floor of the house. </span>
<span sid='16836' title='16836'>It came out upon the landing opposite to a second more ornamental stair which led up from the front hall. </span>
<span sid='16837' title='16837'>Out of this landing opened the drawing-room and several bedrooms, including those of Mr Cunningham and his son. </span>
<span sid='16838' title='16838'>Holmes walked slowly, taking keen note of the architecture of the house. </span>
<span sid='16839' title='16839'>I could tell from his expression that he was on a hot scent, and yet I could not in the least imagine in what direction his inferences were leading him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16840' title='16840'>'My good sir,' said Mr Cunningham, with some impatience, 'this is surely very unnecessary. </span>
<span sid='16841' title='16841'>That is my room at the end of the stairs, and my son's is the one beyond it. </span>
<span sid='16842' title='16842'>I leave it to your judgment whether it was possible for the thief to have come up here without disturbing us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16843' title='16843'>'You must try round and get on a fresh scent, I fancy,' said the son, with a rather malicious smile.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16844' title='16844'>'Still, I must ask you to humour me a little further. </span>
<span sid='16845' title='16845'>I should like, for example, to see how far the windows of the bedrooms command the front. </span>
<span sid='16846' title='16846'>This, I understand, is your son's room' - he pushed open the door - 'and that, I presume, is the dressing-room in which he sat smoking when the alarm was given. </span>
<span sid='16847' title='16847'>Where does the window of that look out to?' </span>
<span sid='16848' title='16848'>He stepped across the bedroom, pushed open the door, and glanced round the other chamber.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16849' title='16849'>'I hope you are satisfied now?' said Mr Cunningham testily.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16850' title='16850'>'Thank you; I think I have seen all that I wished.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16851' title='16851'>'Then, if it is really necessary, we can go into my room.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16852' title='16852'>'If it is not too much trouble.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16853' title='16853'>The J.P. shrugged his shoulders, and led the way into his own chamber, which was a plainly furnished and commonplace room. </span>
<span sid='16854' title='16854'>As we moved across it in the direction of the window, Holmes fell back until he and I were the last of the group. </span>
<span sid='16855' title='16855'>Near the foot of the bed was a small square table, on which stood a dish of oranges and a carafe of water. </span>
<span sid='16856' title='16856'>As we passed it, Holmes, to my unutterable astonishment, leaned over in front of me and deliberately knocked the whole thing over. </span>
<span sid='16857' title='16857'>The glass smashed into a thousand pieces, and the fruit rolled about into every corner of the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16858' title='16858'>'You've done it now, Watson,' said he, coolly. </span>
<span sid='16859' title='16859'>'A pretty mess you've made of the carpet.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16860' title='16860'>I stooped in some confusion and began to pick up the fruit, understanding that for some reason my companion desired me to take the blame upon myself. </span>
<span sid='16861' title='16861'>The others did the same, and set the table on its legs again.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16862' title='16862'>'Hallo!' cried the Inspector, 'where's he got to?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16863' title='16863'>Holmes had disappeared.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16864' title='16864'>'Wait here an instant,' said young Alec Cunningham.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16865' title='16865'>'The fellow is off his head, in my opinion. </span>
<span sid='16866' title='16866'>Come with me, father, and see where he has got to!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16867' title='16867'>They rushed out of the room, leaving the Inspector, the Colonel, and me, staring at each other.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16868' title='16868'>'Pon my word, I am inclined to agree with Mister Alec,' said the official. </span>
<span sid='16869' title='16869'>'It may be the effect of this illness, but it seems to me that-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16870' title='16870'>His words were cut short by a sudden scream of 'Help! </span>
<span sid='16871' title='16871'>Help! </span>
<span sid='16872' title='16872'>Murder!' </span>
<span sid='16873' title='16873'>With a thrill I recognised the voice as that of my friend. </span>
<span sid='16874' title='16874'>I rushed madly from the room on to the landing. </span>
<span sid='16875' title='16875'>The cries, which had sunk down into a hoarse, inarticulate shouting, came from the room which we had first visited. </span>
<span sid='16876' title='16876'>I dashed in, and on into the dressing-room beyond. </span>
<span sid='16877' title='16877'>The two Cunninghams were bending over the prostrate figure of Sherlock Holmes, the younger clutching his throat with both hands, while the elder seemed to be twisting one of his wrists. </span>
<span sid='16878' title='16878'>In an instant the three of us had torn them away from him, and Holmes staggered to his feet, very pale, and evidently greatly exhausted.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16879' title='16879'>'Arrest these men, Inspector!' he gasped.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16880' title='16880'>'On what charge?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16881' title='16881'>'That of murdering their coachman, William Kirwan!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16882' title='16882'>The Inspector stared about him in bewilderment. </span>
<span sid='16883' title='16883'>'Oh, come now, Mr Holmes,' said he at last; 'I am sure you don't really mean to-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16884' title='16884'>'Tut, man; look at their faces!' cried Holmes curtly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16885' title='16885'>Never, certainly, have I seen a plainer confession of guilt upon human countenances. </span>
<span sid='16886' title='16886'>The older man seemed numbed and dazed, with a heavy, sullen expression upon his strongly marked face. </span>
<span sid='16887' title='16887'>The son, on the other hand, had dropped all that jaunty, dashing style which had characterized him, and the ferocity of a dangerous wild beast gleamed in his dark eyes and distorted his handsome features. </span>
<span sid='16888' title='16888'>The Inspector said nothing, but, stepping to the door, he blew his whistle. </span>
<span sid='16889' title='16889'>Two of his constables came at the call.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16890' title='16890'>'I have no alternative, Mr Cunningham,' said he. </span>
<span sid='16891' title='16891'>'I trust that this may all prove to be an absurd mistake; but you can see that - Ah, would you? </span>
<span sid='16892' title='16892'>Drop it!' </span>
<span sid='16893' title='16893'>He struck out with his hand, and a revolver, which the younger man was in the act of cocking, clattered down upon the floor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16894' title='16894'>'Keep that,' said Holmes, quickly putting his foot upon it. </span>
<span sid='16895' title='16895'>'You will find it useful at the trial. </span>
<span sid='16896' title='16896'>But this is what we really wanted.' </span>
<span sid='16897' title='16897'>He held up a little crumpled piece of paper.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16898' title='16898'>'The remainder of the sheet!' cried the Inspector.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16899' title='16899'>'Precisely.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16900' title='16900'>'And where was it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16901' title='16901'>'Where I was sure it must be. </span>
<span sid='16902' title='16902'>I'll make the whole matter clear to you presently. </span>
<span sid='16903' title='16903'>I think, Colonel, that you and Watson might return now, and I will be with you again in an hour at the furthest. </span>
<span sid='16904' title='16904'>The Inspector and I must have a word with the prisoners; but you will certainly see me back at luncheon time.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16905' title='16905'>Sherlock Holmes was as good as his word, for about one o'clock he rejoined us in the Colonel's smoking-room. </span>
<span sid='16906' title='16906'>He was accompanied by a little, elderly gentleman, who was introduced to me as the Mr Acton whose house had been the scene of the original burglary.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16907' title='16907'>'I wished Mr Acton to be present while I demonstrated this small matter to you,' said Holmes, 'for it is natural that he should take a keen interest in the details. </span>
<span sid='16908' title='16908'>I am afraid, my dear Colonel, that you must regret the hour that you took in such a stormy petrel as I am.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16909' title='16909'>'On the contrary,' answered the Colonel, warmly, 'I consider it the greatest privilege to have been permitted to study your methods of working. </span>
<span sid='16910' title='16910'>I confess that they quite surpass my expectations, and that I am utterly unable to account for your result. </span>
<span sid='16911' title='16911'>I have not yet seen the vestige of a clue.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16912' title='16912'>'I am afraid that my explanation may disillusionize you, but it has always been my habit to hide none of my methods, either from my friend Watson or from anyone who might take an intelligent interest in them. </span>
<span sid='16913' title='16913'>But first, as I am rather shaken by the knocking about which I had in the dressing-room, I think that I shall help myself to a dash of your brandy, Colonel. </span>
<span sid='16914' title='16914'>My strength has been rather tried of late.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16915' title='16915'>'I trust you had no more of those nervous attacks.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16916' title='16916'>Sherlock Holmes laughed heartily. </span>
<span sid='16917' title='16917'>'We will come to that in its turn,' said he. </span>
<span sid='16918' title='16918'>'I will lay an account of the case before you in its due order, showing you the various points which guided me in my decision. </span>
<span sid='16919' title='16919'>Pray interrupt me if there is any inference which is not perfectly clear to you.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16920' title='16920'>'It is of the highest importance in the art of detection to be able to recognise out of a number of facts which are incidental and which vital. </span>
<span sid='16921' title='16921'>Otherwise your energy and attention must be dissipated instead of being concentrated. </span>
<span sid='16922' title='16922'>Now, in this case there was not the slightest doubt in my mind from the first that the key of the whole matter must be looked for in the scrap of paper in the dead man's hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16923' title='16923'>'Before going into this I would draw your attention to the fact that if Alec Cunningham's narrative were correct, and if the assailant after shooting William Kirwan had instantly fled, then it obviously could not be he who tore the paper from the dead man's hand. </span>
<span sid='16924' title='16924'>But if it was not he, it must have been Alec Cunningham himself, for by the time the old man had descended several servants were upon the scene. </span>
<span sid='16925' title='16925'>The point is a simple one, but the Inspector had overlooked it because he had started with the supposition that these county magnates had had nothing to do with the matter. </span>
<span sid='16926' title='16926'>Now, I make a point of never having any prejudices and of following docilely wherever fact may lead me, and so in the very first stage of the investigation I found myself looking a little askance at the part which had been played by Mr Alec Cunningham.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16927' title='16927'>'And now I made a very careful examination of the corner of paper which the Inspector had submitted to us. </span>
<span sid='16928' title='16928'>It was at once clear to me that it formed part of a very remarkable document. </span>
<span sid='16929' title='16929'>Here it is. </span>
<span sid='16930' title='16930'>Do you not now observe something very suggestive about it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16931' title='16931'>'It has a very irregular look,' said the Colonel.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16932' title='16932'>'My dear sir,' cried Holmes, 'there cannot be the least doubt in the world that it has been written by two persons doing alternate words. </span>
<span sid='16933' title='16933'>When I draw your attention to the strong t's of "at" and "to" and ask you to compare them with the weak ones of "quarter" and "twelve," you will instantly recognise the fact. </span>
<span sid='16934' title='16934'>A very brief analysis of those four words would enable you to say with the utmost confidence that the "learn" and the "maybe" are written in the stronger hand, and the "what" in the weaker.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16935' title='16935'>'By Jove, it's as clear as day!' cried the Colonel. </span>
<span sid='16936' title='16936'>'Why on earth should two men write a letter in such a fashion?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16937' title='16937'>'Obviously the business was a bad one, and one of the men who distrusted the other was determined that, whatever was done, each should have an equal hand in it. </span>
<span sid='16938' title='16938'>Now, of the two men it is clear that the one who wrote the "at" and "to" was the ringleader.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16939' title='16939'>'How do you get at that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16940' title='16940'>'We might deduce it from the mere character of the one hand as compared with the other. </span>
<span sid='16941' title='16941'>But we have more assured reasons than that for supposing it. </span>
<span sid='16942' title='16942'>If you examine this scrap with attention you will come to the conclusion that the man with the stronger hand wrote all his words first, leaving blanks for the other to fill up. </span>
<span sid='16943' title='16943'>These blanks were not always sufficient, and you can see that the second man had a squeeze to fit his "quarter" in between the "at" and the "to", showing that the latter were already written. </span>
<span sid='16944' title='16944'>The man who wrote all his words first is undoubtedly the man who planned this affair.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16945' title='16945'>'Excellent!' cried Mr Acton.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16946' title='16946'>'But very superficial,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='16947' title='16947'>'We come now, however, to a point which is of importance. </span>
<span sid='16948' title='16948'>You may not be aware that the deduction of a man's age from his writing is one which has been brought to considerable accuracy by experts. </span>
<span sid='16949' title='16949'>In normal cases one can place a man in his true decade with tolerable confidence. </span>
<span sid='16950' title='16950'>I say normal cases, because ill-health and physical weakness reproduce the signs of old age, even when the invalid is a youth. </span>
<span sid='16951' title='16951'>In this case, looking at the bold, strong hand of the one, and the rather broken-backed appearance of the other, which still retains its legibility, although the t's have begun to lose their crossings, we can say that the one was a young man, and the other was advanced in years without being positively decrepit.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16952' title='16952'>'Excellent!' cried Mr Acton again.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16953' title='16953'>'There is a further point, however, which is subtler and of greater interest. </span>
<span sid='16954' title='16954'>There is something in common between these hands. </span>
<span sid='16955' title='16955'>They belong to men who are blood-relatives. </span>
<span sid='16956' title='16956'>It may be most obvious to you in the Greek e's, but to me there are many small points which indicate the same thing. </span>
<span sid='16957' title='16957'>I have no doubt at all that a family mannerism can be traced in these two specimens of writing. </span>
<span sid='16958' title='16958'>I am only, of course, giving you the leading results now of my examination of the paper. </span>
<span sid='16959' title='16959'>There were twenty-three other deductions which would be of more interest to experts than to you. </span>
<span sid='16960' title='16960'>They all tended to deepen the impression upon my mind that the Cunninghams, father and son, had written this letter.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16961' title='16961'>'Having got so far, my next step was, of course, to examine into the details of the crime and to see how far they would help us. </span>
<span sid='16962' title='16962'>I went up to the house with the Inspector, and saw all that was to be seen. </span>
<span sid='16963' title='16963'>The wound upon the dead man was, as I was able to determine with absolute confidence, caused by a shot from a revolver fired at the distance of something over four yards. </span>
<span sid='16964' title='16964'>There was no powder-blackening on the clothes. </span>
<span sid='16965' title='16965'>Evidently, therefore, Alec Cunningham had lied when he said that the two men were struggling when the shot was fired. </span>
<span sid='16966' title='16966'>Again, both father and son agreed as to the place where the man escaped into the road. </span>
<span sid='16967' title='16967'>At that point, however, as it happens, there is a broadish ditch, moist at the bottom. </span>
<span sid='16968' title='16968'>As there were no indications of boot-marks about this ditch, I was absolutely sure not only that the Cunninghams had again lied, but that there had never been any unknown man upon the scene at all.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16969' title='16969'>'And now I had to consider the motive of this singular crime. </span>
<span sid='16970' title='16970'>To get at this I endeavoured first of all to solve the reason of the original burglary at Mr Acton's. </span>
<span sid='16971' title='16971'>I understood from something which the Colonel told us that a law-suit had been going on between you, Mr Acton, and the Cunninghams. </span>
<span sid='16972' title='16972'>Of course, it instantly occurred to me that they had broken into your library with the intention of getting at some document which might be of importance in the case.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16973' title='16973'>'Precisely so,' said Mr Acton; 'there can be no possible doubt as to their intentions. </span>
<span sid='16974' title='16974'>I have the clearest claim upon half their present estate, and if they could have found a single paper - which, fortunately, was in the strong box of my solicitors - they would undoubtedly have crippled our case.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16975' title='16975'>'There you are!' said Holmes, smiling. </span>
<span sid='16976' title='16976'>'It was a dangerous, reckless attempt, in which I seem to trace the influence of young Alec. </span>
<span sid='16977' title='16977'>Having found nothing, they tried to divert suspicion by making it appear to be an ordinary burglary, to which end they carried off whatever they could lay their hands upon. </span>
<span sid='16978' title='16978'>That is all clear enough, but there was much that was still obscure. </span>
<span sid='16979' title='16979'>What I wanted above all was to get the missing part of that note. </span>
<span sid='16980' title='16980'>I was certain that Alec had torn it out of the dead man's hand, and almost certain that he must have thrust it into the pocket of his dressing-gown. </span>
<span sid='16981' title='16981'>Where else could he have put it? </span>
<span sid='16982' title='16982'>The only question was whether it was still there. </span>
<span sid='16983' title='16983'>It was worth an effort to find out, and for that object we all went up to the house.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16984' title='16984'>'The Cunninghams joined us, as you doubtless remember, outside the kitchen door. </span>
<span sid='16985' title='16985'>It was, of course, of the very first importance that they should not be reminded of the existence of this paper, otherwise they would naturally destroy it without delay. </span>
<span sid='16986' title='16986'>The Inspector was about to tell them the importance which we attached to it when, by the luckiest chance in the world, I tumbled down in a sort of fit and so changed the conversation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16987' title='16987'>'Good heavens!' cried the Colonel, laughing. </span>
<span sid='16988' title='16988'>'Do you mean to say all our sympathy was wasted and your fit an imposture?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16989' title='16989'>'Speaking professionally, it was admirably done,' cried I, looking in amazement at this man who was for ever confounding me with some new phase of his astuteness.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16990' title='16990'>'It is an art which is often useful,' said he. </span>
<span sid='16991' title='16991'>'When I recovered I managed by a device, which had, perhaps, some little merit of ingenuity, to get old Cunningham to write the word "twelve", so that I might compare it with the "twelve" upon the paper.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16992' title='16992'>'Oh, what an ass I have been!' I exclaimed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16993' title='16993'>'I could see that you were commiserating with me over my weakness,' said Holmes, laughing. </span>
<span sid='16994' title='16994'>'I was sorry to cause you the sympathetic pain which I know that you felt. </span>
<span sid='16995' title='16995'>We then went upstairs together, and having entered the room and seen the dressing-gown hanging up behind the door, I contrived by upsetting a table to engage their attention for the moment and slipped back to examine the pockets. </span>
<span sid='16996' title='16996'>I had hardly got the paper, however, which was as I had expected, in one of them, when the two Cunninghams were on me, and would, I verily believe, have murdered me then and there but for your prompt and friendly aid. </span>
<span sid='16997' title='16997'>As it is, I feel that young man's grip on my throat now, and the father has twisted my wrist round in the effort to get the paper out of my hand. </span>
<span sid='16998' title='16998'>They saw that I must know all about it, you see, and the sudden change from absolute security to complete despair made them perfectly desperate.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16999' title='16999'>'I had a little talk with old Cunningham afterwards as to the motive of the crime. </span>
<span sid='17000' title='17000'>He was tractable enough, though his son was a perfect demon, ready to blow out his own or anybody else's brains if he could have got to his revolver. </span>
<span sid='17001' title='17001'>When Cunningham saw that the case against him was so strong he lost all heart, and made a clean breast of everything. </span>
<span sid='17002' title='17002'>It seems that William had secretly followed his two masters on the night when they made their raid upon Mr Acton's, and, having thus got them into his power, proceeded under threats of exposure to levy blackmail upon them. </span>
<span sid='17003' title='17003'>Mister Alec, however, was a dangerous man to play games of that sort with. </span>
<span sid='17004' title='17004'>It was a stroke of positive genius on his part to see in the burglary scare, which was convulsing the country-side, an opportunity of plausibly getting rid of the man whom he feared. </span>
<span sid='17005' title='17005'>William was decoyed up and shot; and, had they only got the whole of the note, and paid a little more attention to detail in their accessories, it is very possible that suspicion might never have been aroused.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17006' title='17006'>'And the note?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17007' title='17007'>Sherlock Holmes placed the subjoined paper before us:</span>
<p>
<span sid='17008' title='17008'>'It is very much the sort of thing that I expected,' said he. </span>
<span sid='17009' title='17009'>'Of course, we do not yet know what the relations may have been between Alec Cunningham, William Kirwan, and Annie Morrison. </span>
<span sid='17010' title='17010'>The result shows that the trap was skilfully baited. </span>
<span sid='17011' title='17011'>I am sure that you cannot fail to be delighted with the traces of heredity shown in the p's and in the tails of the g's. </span>
<span sid='17012' title='17012'>The absence of the i-dots in the old man's writing is also most characteristic. </span>
<span sid='17013' title='17013'>Watson, I think our quiet rest in the country has been a distinct success, and I shall certainly return, much invigorated, to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> to-morrow.'</span>
