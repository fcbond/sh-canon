<p>
<span sid='51515' title='51515'>It was pleasant to Dr Watson to find himself once more in the untidy room of the first floor in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> which had been the starting-point of so many remarkable adventures. </span>
<span sid='51516' title='51516'>He looked round him at the scientific charts upon the wall, the acid-charred bench of chemicals, the violin-case leaning in the corner, the coal-scuttle, which contained of old the pipes and tobacco. </span>
<span sid='51517' title='51517'>Finally, his eyes came round to the fresh and smiling face of Billy the young but very wise and tactful page, who had helped a little to fill up the gap of loneliness and isolation which surrounded the saturnine figure of the great detective.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51518' title='51518'>'It all seems very unchanged, Billy. </span>
<span sid='51519' title='51519'>You don't change, either. </span>
<span sid='51520' title='51520'>I hope the same can be said of him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51521' title='51521'>Billy glanced, with some solicitude, at the closed door of the bedroom.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51522' title='51522'>'I think he's in bed and asleep,' he said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51523' title='51523'>It was seven in the evening of a lovely summer's day, but Dr Watson was sufficiently familiar with the irregularity of his old friend's hours to feel no surprise at the idea.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51524' title='51524'>'That means a case, I suppose?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51525' title='51525'>'Yes, sir, he is very hard at it just now. </span>
<span sid='51526' title='51526'>I'm frightened for his health. </span>
<span sid='51527' title='51527'>He gets paler and thinner, and he eats nothing. </span>
<span sid='51528' title='51528'>"When will you be pleased to dine, Mr Holmes?" Mrs Hudson asked. </span>
<span sid='51529' title='51529'>"Seven-thirty, the day after tomorrow," said he. </span>
<span sid='51530' title='51530'>You know his way when he is keen on a case.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51531' title='51531'>'Yes, Billy, I know.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51532' title='51532'>'He's following someone. </span>
<span sid='51533' title='51533'>Yesterday he was out as a workman looking for a job. </span>
<span sid='51534' title='51534'>To-day he was an old woman. </span>
<span sid='51535' title='51535'>Fairly took me in, he did, and I ought to know his ways by now.' </span>
<span sid='51536' title='51536'>Billy pointed with a grin to a very baggy parasol which leaned against the sofa. </span>
<span sid='51537' title='51537'>'That's part of the old woman's outfit,' he said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51538' title='51538'>'But what is it all about, Billy?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51539' title='51539'>Billy sank his voice, as one who discusses great secrets of State. </span>
<span sid='51540' title='51540'>'I don't mind telling you, sir, but it should go no farther. </span>
<span sid='51541' title='51541'>It's this case of the Crown diamond.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51542' title='51542'>'What - the hundred-thousand-pound burglary?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51543' title='51543'>'Yes, sir. </span>
<span sid='51544' title='51544'>They must get it back, sir. </span>
<span sid='51545' title='51545'>Why, we had the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary both sitting on that very sofa. </span>
<span sid='51546' title='51546'>Mr Holmes was very nice to them. </span>
<span sid='51547' title='51547'>He soon put them at their ease and promised he would do all he could. </span>
<span sid='51548' title='51548'>Then there is Lord Cantlemere-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51549' title='51549'>'Ah!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51550' title='51550'>'Yes, sir, you know what that means. </span>
<span sid='51551' title='51551'>He's a stiff 'un, sir, if I may say so. </span>
<span sid='51552' title='51552'>I can get along with the Prime Minister, and I've nothing against the Home Secretary, who seemed a civil, obliging sort of man, but I can't stand his lordship. </span>
<span sid='51553' title='51553'>Neither can Mr Holmes, sir. </span>
<span sid='51554' title='51554'>You see, he don't believe in Mr Holmes and he was against employing him. </span>
<span sid='51555' title='51555'>He'd rather he failed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51556' title='51556'>'And Mr Holmes knows it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51557' title='51557'>'Mr Holmes always knows whatever there is to know.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51558' title='51558'>'Well, we'll hope he won't fail and that Lord Cantlemere will be confounded. </span>
<span sid='51559' title='51559'>But I say, Billy, what is that curtain for across the window?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51560' title='51560'>'Mr Holmes had it put up there three days ago. </span>
<span sid='51561' title='51561'>We've got something funny behind it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51562' title='51562'>Billy advanced and drew away the drapery which screened the alcove of the bow window.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51563' title='51563'>Dr Watson could not restrain a cry of amazement. </span>
<span sid='51564' title='51564'>There was a facsimile of his old friend, dressing-gown and all, the face turned three-quarters towards the window and downwards, as though reading an invisible book, while the body was sunk deep in an arm-chair. </span>
<span sid='51565' title='51565'>Billy detached the head and held it in the air.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51566' title='51566'>'We put it at different angles, so that it may seem more life-like. </span>
<span sid='51567' title='51567'>I wouldn't dare touch it if the blind were not down. </span>
<span sid='51568' title='51568'>But when it's up you can see this from across the way.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51569' title='51569'>'We used something of the sort once before.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51570' title='51570'>'Before my time,' said Billy. </span>
<span sid='51571' title='51571'>He drew the window curtains apart and looked out into the street. </span>
<span sid='51572' title='51572'>'There are folk who watch us from over yonder. </span>
<span sid='51573' title='51573'>I can see a fellow now at the window. </span>
<span sid='51574' title='51574'>Have a look for yourself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51575' title='51575'>Watson had taken a step forward when the bedroom door opened, and the long, thin form of Holmes emerged, his face pale and drawn, but his step and bearing as active as ever. </span>
<span sid='51576' title='51576'>With a single spring he was at the window, and had drawn the blind once more.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51577' title='51577'>'That will do, Billy,' said he. </span>
<span sid='51578' title='51578'>'You were in danger of your life then, my boy, and I can't do without you just yet. </span>
<span sid='51579' title='51579'>Well, Watson, it is good to see you in your old quarters once again. </span>
<span sid='51580' title='51580'>You come at a critical moment.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51581' title='51581'>'So I gather.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51582' title='51582'>'You can go, Billy. </span>
<span sid='51583' title='51583'>That boy is a problem, Watson. </span>
<span sid='51584' title='51584'>How far am I justified in allowing him to be in danger?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51585' title='51585'>'Danger of what, Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51586' title='51586'>'Of sudden death. </span>
<span sid='51587' title='51587'>I'm expecting something this evening.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51588' title='51588'>'Expecting what?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51589' title='51589'>'To be murdered, Watson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51590' title='51590'>'No, no, you are joking, Holmes!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51591' title='51591'>'Even my limited sense of humour could evolve a better joke than that. </span>
<span sid='51592' title='51592'>But we may be comfortable in the mean time, may we not? </span>
<span sid='51593' title='51593'>Is alcohol permitted? </span>
<span sid='51594' title='51594'>The gasogene and cigars are in the old place. </span>
<span sid='51595' title='51595'>Let me see you once more in the customary arm-chair. </span>
<span sid='51596' title='51596'>You have not, I hope, learned to despise my pipe and my lamentable tobacco? </span>
<span sid='51597' title='51597'>It has to take the place of food these days.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51598' title='51598'>'But why not eat?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51599' title='51599'>'Because the faculties become refined when you starve them. </span>
<span sid='51600' title='51600'>Why, surely, as a doctor, my dear Watson, you must admit that what your digestion gains in the way of blood supply is so much lost to the brain. </span>
<span sid='51601' title='51601'>I am a brain, Watson. </span>
<span sid='51602' title='51602'>The rest of me is a mere appendix. </span>
<span sid='51603' title='51603'>Therefore, it is the brain I must consider.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51604' title='51604'>'But this danger, Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51605' title='51605'>'Ah, yes, in case it should come off, it would perhaps be as well that you should burden your memory with the name and address of the murderer. </span>
<span sid='51606' title='51606'>You can give it to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>, with my love and a parting blessing. </span>
<span sid='51607' title='51607'>Sylvius is the name - Count Negretto Sylvius. </span>
<span sid='51608' title='51608'>Write it down, man, write it down! </span>
<span sid='51609' title='51609'>136, Moorside Gardens, NW. </span>
<span sid='51610' title='51610'>Got it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51611' title='51611'>Watson's honest face was twitching with anxiety. </span>
<span sid='51612' title='51612'>He knew only too well the immense risks taken by Holmes, and was well aware that what he said was more likely to be understatement than exaggeration. </span>
<span sid='51613' title='51613'>Watson was always the man of action, and he rose to the occasion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51614' title='51614'>'Count me in, Holmes. </span>
<span sid='51615' title='51615'>I have nothing to do for a day or two.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51616' title='51616'>'Your morals don't improve, Watson. </span>
<span sid='51617' title='51617'>You have added fibbing to your other vices. </span>
<span sid='51618' title='51618'>You bear every sign of the busy medical man, with calls on him every hour.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51619' title='51619'>'Not such important ones. </span>
<span sid='51620' title='51620'>But can't you have this fellow arrested?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51621' title='51621'>'Yes, Watson, I could. </span>
<span sid='51622' title='51622'>That's what worries him so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51623' title='51623'>'But why don't you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51624' title='51624'>'Because I don't know where the diamond is.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51625' title='51625'>'Ah! </span>
<span sid='51626' title='51626'>Billy told me - the missing Crown Jewel!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51627' title='51627'>'Yes, the great yellow Mazarin stone. </span>
<span sid='51628' title='51628'>I've cast my net and I have my fish. </span>
<span sid='51629' title='51629'>But I have not got the stone. </span>
<span sid='51630' title='51630'>What is the use of taking them? </span>
<span sid='51631' title='51631'>We can make the world a better place by laying them by the heels. </span>
<span sid='51632' title='51632'>But that is not what I am out for. </span>
<span sid='51633' title='51633'>It's the stone I want.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51634' title='51634'>'And is this Count Sylvius one of your fish?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51635' title='51635'>'Yes, and he's a shark. </span>
<span sid='51636' title='51636'>He bites. </span>
<span sid='51637' title='51637'>The other is Sam Merton, the boxer. </span>
<span sid='51638' title='51638'>Not a bad fellow, Sam, but the Count has used him. </span>
<span sid='51639' title='51639'>Sam's not a shark. </span>
<span sid='51640' title='51640'>He is a great big silly bull-headed gudgeon. </span>
<span sid='51641' title='51641'>But he is flopping about in my net all the same.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51642' title='51642'>'Where is this Count Sylvius?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51643' title='51643'>'I've been at his very elbow all the morning. </span>
<span sid='51644' title='51644'>You've seen me as an old lady, Watson. </span>
<span sid='51645' title='51645'>I was never more convincing. </span>
<span sid='51646' title='51646'>He actually picked up my parasol for me once. </span>
<span sid='51647' title='51647'>"By your leave, madame," said he - half-Italian, you know, and with the Southern graces of manner when in the mood, but a devil incarnate in the other mood. </span>
<span sid='51648' title='51648'>Life is full of whimsical happenings, Watson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51649' title='51649'>'It might have been tragedy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51650' title='51650'>'Well, perhaps it might. </span>
<span sid='51651' title='51651'>I followed him to old Straubenzee's workshop in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Minories&t=h'>the Minories</a>. </span>
<span sid='51652' title='51652'>Straubenzee made the air-gun - a very pretty bit of work, as I understand, and I rather fancy it is in the opposite window at the present moment. </span>
<span sid='51653' title='51653'>Have you seen the dummy? </span>
<span sid='51654' title='51654'>Of course, Billy showed it to you. </span>
<span sid='51655' title='51655'>Well, it may get a bullet through its beautiful head at any moment. </span>
<span sid='51656' title='51656'>Ah, Billy, what is it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51657' title='51657'>The boy had reappeared in the room with a card upon a tray. </span>
<span sid='51658' title='51658'>Holmes glanced at it with raised eyebrows and an amused smile.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51659' title='51659'>'The man himself. </span>
<span sid='51660' title='51660'>I had hardly expected this. </span>
<span sid='51661' title='51661'>Grasp the nettle, Watson! </span>
<span sid='51662' title='51662'>A man of nerve. </span>
<span sid='51663' title='51663'>Possibly you have heard of his reputation as a shooter of big game. </span>
<span sid='51664' title='51664'>It would indeed be a triumphant ending to his excellent sporting record if he added me to his bag. </span>
<span sid='51665' title='51665'>This is a proof that he feels my toe very close behind his heel.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51666' title='51666'>'Send for the police.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51667' title='51667'>'I probably shall. </span>
<span sid='51668' title='51668'>But not just yet. </span>
<span sid='51669' title='51669'>Would you glance carefully out of the window, Watson, and see if anyone is hanging about in the street?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51670' title='51670'>Watson looked warily round the edge of the curtain.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51671' title='51671'>'Yes, there is one rough fellow near the door.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51672' title='51672'>'That will be Sam Merton - the faithful but rather fatuous Sam. </span>
<span sid='51673' title='51673'>Where is this gentleman, Billy?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51674' title='51674'>'In the waiting-room, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51675' title='51675'>'Show him up when I ring.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51676' title='51676'>'Yes, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51677' title='51677'>'If I am not in the room, show him in all the same.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51678' title='51678'>'Yes, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51679' title='51679'>Watson waited until the door was closed, and then he turned earnestly to his companion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51680' title='51680'>'Look here, Holmes, this is simply impossible. </span>
<span sid='51681' title='51681'>This is a desperate man, who sticks at nothing. </span>
<span sid='51682' title='51682'>He may have come to murder you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51683' title='51683'>'I should not be surprised.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51684' title='51684'>'I insist upon staying with you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51685' title='51685'>'You would be horribly in the way.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51686' title='51686'>'In his way?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51687' title='51687'>'No, my dear fellow - in my way.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51688' title='51688'>'Well, I can't possibly leave you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51689' title='51689'>'Yes, you can, Watson. </span>
<span sid='51690' title='51690'>And you will, for you have never failed to play the game. </span>
<span sid='51691' title='51691'>I am sure you will play it to the end. </span>
<span sid='51692' title='51692'>This man has come for his own purpose, but he may stay for mine.' </span>
<span sid='51693' title='51693'>Holmes took out his notebook and scribbled a few lines. </span>
<span sid='51694' title='51694'>'Take a cab to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a> and give this to Youghal of the CID. </span>
<span sid='51695' title='51695'>Come back with the police. </span>
<span sid='51696' title='51696'>The fellow's arrest will follow.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51697' title='51697'>'I'll do that with joy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51698' title='51698'>'Before you return I may have just time enough to find out where the stone is.' </span>
<span sid='51699' title='51699'>He touched the bell. </span>
<span sid='51700' title='51700'>'I think we will go out through the bedroom. </span>
<span sid='51701' title='51701'>This second exit is exceedingly useful. </span>
<span sid='51702' title='51702'>I rather want to see my shark without his seeing me, and I have, as you will remember, my own way of doing it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51703' title='51703'>It was, therefore, an empty room into which Billy, a minute later, ushered Count Sylvius. </span>
<span sid='51704' title='51704'>The famous gameshot, sportsman, and man-about-town was a big, swarthy fellow, with a formidable dark moustache, shading a cruel, thin-lipped mouth, and surmounted by a long, curved nose, like the beak of an eagle. </span>
<span sid='51705' title='51705'>He was well dressed, but his brilliant necktie, shining pin, and glittering rings were flamboyant in their effect. </span>
<span sid='51706' title='51706'>As the door closed behind him he looked round him with fierce, startled eyes, like one who suspects a trap at every turn. </span>
<span sid='51707' title='51707'>Then he gave a violent start as he saw the impassive head and the collar of the dressing-gown which projected above the arm-chair in the window. </span>
<span sid='51708' title='51708'>At first his expression was one of pure amazement. </span>
<span sid='51709' title='51709'>Then the light of a horrible hope gleamed in his dark, murderous eyes. </span>
<span sid='51710' title='51710'>He took one more glance round to see that there were no witnesses, and then, on tiptoe, his thick stick half raised, he approached the silent figure. </span>
<span sid='51711' title='51711'>He was crouching for his final spring and blow when a cool, sardonic voice greeted him from the open bedroom door:</span>
<p>
<span sid='51712' title='51712'>'Don't break it, Count! </span>
<span sid='51713' title='51713'>Don't break it!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51714' title='51714'>The assassin staggered back, amazement in his convulsed face. </span>
<span sid='51715' title='51715'>For an instant he half raised his loaded cane once more, as if he would turn his violence from the effigy to the original, but there was something in that steady grey eye and mocking smile which caused his hand to sink to his side.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51716' title='51716'>'It's a pretty little thing,' said Holmes, advancing towards the image. </span>
<span sid='51717' title='51717'>'Tavernier, the French modeller made it. </span>
<span sid='51718' title='51718'>He is as good at waxworks as your friend Straubenzee is at air-guns.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51719' title='51719'>'Air-guns, sir! </span>
<span sid='51720' title='51720'>What do you mean?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51721' title='51721'>'Put your hat and stick on the side-table. </span>
<span sid='51722' title='51722'>Thank you! </span>
<span sid='51723' title='51723'>Pray take a seat. </span>
<span sid='51724' title='51724'>Would you care to put your revolver out also? </span>
<span sid='51725' title='51725'>Oh, very good, if you prefer to sit upon it. </span>
<span sid='51726' title='51726'>Your visit is really most opportune, for I wanted badly to have a few minutes' chat with you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51727' title='51727'>The Count scowled, with heavy, threatening eyebrows.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51728' title='51728'>'I too, wished to have some words with you, Holmes. </span>
<span sid='51729' title='51729'>That is why I am here. </span>
<span sid='51730' title='51730'>I won't deny that I intended to assault you just now.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51731' title='51731'>Holmes swung his leg on the edge of the table.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51732' title='51732'>'I rather gathered that you had some idea of the sort in your head,' said he. </span>
<span sid='51733' title='51733'>'But why these personal attentions?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51734' title='51734'>'Because you have gone out of your way to annoy me. </span>
<span sid='51735' title='51735'>Because you have put your creatures upon my track.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51736' title='51736'>'My creatures! </span>
<span sid='51737' title='51737'>I assure you no!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51738' title='51738'>'Nonsense! </span>
<span sid='51739' title='51739'>I have had them followed. </span>
<span sid='51740' title='51740'>Two can play at that game, Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51741' title='51741'>'It is a small point, Count Sylvius, but perhaps you would kindly give me my prefix when you address me. </span>
<span sid='51742' title='51742'>You can understand that, with my routine of work, I should find myself on familiar terms with half the rogues' gallery, and you will agree that exceptions are invidious.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51743' title='51743'>'Well, Mr Holmes, then.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51744' title='51744'>'Excellent! </span>
<span sid='51745' title='51745'>But I assure you you are mistaken about my alleged agents.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51746' title='51746'>Count Sylvius laughed contemptuously.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51747' title='51747'>'Other people can observe as well as you. </span>
<span sid='51748' title='51748'>Yesterday there was an old sporting man. </span>
<span sid='51749' title='51749'>To-day it was an elderly woman. </span>
<span sid='51750' title='51750'>They held me in view all day.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51751' title='51751'>'Really, sir, you compliment me. </span>
<span sid='51752' title='51752'>Old Baron Dowson said the night before he was hanged that in my case what the law had gained the stage had lost. </span>
<span sid='51753' title='51753'>And now you give my little impersonations your kindly praise!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51754' title='51754'>'It was you - you yourself?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51755' title='51755'>Holmes shrugged his shoulders. </span>
<span sid='51756' title='51756'>'You can see in the corner the parasol which you so politely handed to me in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Minories&t=h'>the Minories</a> before you began to suspect.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51757' title='51757'>'If I had known, you might never-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51758' title='51758'>'Have seen this humble home again. </span>
<span sid='51759' title='51759'>I was well aware of it. </span>
<span sid='51760' title='51760'>We all have neglected opportunities to deplore. </span>
<span sid='51761' title='51761'>As it happens, you did not know, so here we are!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51762' title='51762'>The Count's knotted brows gathered more heavily over his menacing eyes. </span>
<span sid='51763' title='51763'>'What you say only makes the matter worse. </span>
<span sid='51764' title='51764'>It was not your agents, but your play-acting, busybody self! </span>
<span sid='51765' title='51765'>You admit that you have dogged me. </span>
<span sid='51766' title='51766'>Why?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51767' title='51767'>'Come now, Count. </span>
<span sid='51768' title='51768'>You used to shoot lions in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Algeria&t=h'>Algeria</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51769' title='51769'>'Well?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51770' title='51770'>'But why?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51771' title='51771'>'Why? </span>
<span sid='51772' title='51772'>The sport - the excitement - the danger!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51773' title='51773'>'And, no doubt, to free the country from a pest?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51774' title='51774'>'Exactly!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51775' title='51775'>'My reasons in a nutshell!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51776' title='51776'>The Count sprang to his feet, and his hand involuntarily moved back to his hip-pocket.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51777' title='51777'>'Sit down, sir, sit down! </span>
<span sid='51778' title='51778'>There was another, more practical, reason. </span>
<span sid='51779' title='51779'>I want that yellow diamond!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51780' title='51780'>Count Sylvius lay back in his chair with an evil smile.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51781' title='51781'>'Upon my word!' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51782' title='51782'>'You knew that I was after you for that. </span>
<span sid='51783' title='51783'>The real reason why you are here to-night is to find out how much I know about the matter and how far my removal is absolutely essential. </span>
<span sid='51784' title='51784'>Well, I should say that, from your point of view, it is absolutely essential, for I know all about it, save only one thing, which you are about to tell me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51785' title='51785'>'Oh, indeed! </span>
<span sid='51786' title='51786'>And, pray, what is this missing fact?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51787' title='51787'>'Where the Crown diamond now is.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51788' title='51788'>The Count looked sharply at his companion. </span>
<span sid='51789' title='51789'>'Oh, you want to know that, do you? </span>
<span sid='51790' title='51790'>How the devil should I be able to tell you where it is?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51791' title='51791'>'You can, and you will.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51792' title='51792'>'Indeed!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51793' title='51793'>'You can't bluff me, Count Sylvius.' </span>
<span sid='51794' title='51794'>Holmes's eyes, as he gazed at him, contracted and lightened until they were like two menacing points of steel. </span>
<span sid='51795' title='51795'>'You are absolute plate-glass. </span>
<span sid='51796' title='51796'>I see to the very back of your mind.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51797' title='51797'>'Then, of course, you see where the diamond is!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51798' title='51798'>Holmes clapped his hands with amusement, and then pointed a derisive finger. </span>
<span sid='51799' title='51799'>'Then you do know. </span>
<span sid='51800' title='51800'>You have admitted it!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51801' title='51801'>'I admit nothing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51802' title='51802'>'Now, Count, if you will be reasonable, we can do business. </span>
<span sid='51803' title='51803'>If not, you will get hurt.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51804' title='51804'>Count Sylvius threw up his eyes to the ceiling. </span>
<span sid='51805' title='51805'>'And you talk about bluff!' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51806' title='51806'>Holmes looked at him thoughtfully, like a master chessplayer who meditates his crowning move. </span>
<span sid='51807' title='51807'>Then he threw open the table drawer and drew out a squat note-book.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51808' title='51808'>'Do you know what I keep in this book?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51809' title='51809'>'No, sir, I do not!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51810' title='51810'>'You!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51811' title='51811'>'Me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51812' title='51812'>'Yes, sir, you! </span>
<span sid='51813' title='51813'>You are all here - every action of your vile and dangerous life.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51814' title='51814'>'Damn you, Holmes!' cried the Count, with blazing eyes. </span>
<span sid='51815' title='51815'>'There are limits to my patience!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51816' title='51816'>'It's all here, Count. </span>
<span sid='51817' title='51817'>The real facts as to the death of old Mrs Harold, who left you the Blymer estate, which you so rapidly gambled away.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51818' title='51818'>'You are dreaming!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51819' title='51819'>'And the complete life history of Miss Minnie Warrender.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51820' title='51820'>'Tut! </span>
<span sid='51821' title='51821'>You will make nothing of that!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51822' title='51822'>'Plenty more here, Count. </span>
<span sid='51823' title='51823'>Here is the robbery in the train-de-luxe to the Riviera on February 13, 1892. </span>
<span sid='51824' title='51824'>Here is the forged cheque in the same year on the Credit Lyonnais.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51825' title='51825'>'No, you're wrong there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51826' title='51826'>'Then I am right on the others! </span>
<span sid='51827' title='51827'>Now, Count, you are a card-player. </span>
<span sid='51828' title='51828'>When the other fellow has all the trumps, it saves time to throw down your hand.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51829' title='51829'>'What has all this talk to do with the jewel of which you spoke?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51830' title='51830'>'Gently, Count. </span>
<span sid='51831' title='51831'>Restrain that eager mind! </span>
<span sid='51832' title='51832'>Let me get to the points in my own humdrum fashion. </span>
<span sid='51833' title='51833'>I have all this against you, but, above all, I have a clear case against both you and your fighting bully in the case of the Crown diamond.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51834' title='51834'>'Indeed!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51835' title='51835'>'I have the cabman who took you to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Whitehall&t=h'>Whitehall</a> and the cabman who brought you away. </span>
<span sid='51836' title='51836'>I have the Commissionaire who saw you near the case. </span>
<span sid='51837' title='51837'>I have Ikey Sanders, who refused to cut it up for you. </span>
<span sid='51838' title='51838'>Ikey has peached, and the game is up.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51839' title='51839'>The veins stood out on the Count's forehead. </span>
<span sid='51840' title='51840'>His dark, hairy hands were clenched in a convulsion of restrained emotion. </span>
<span sid='51841' title='51841'>He tried to speak, but the words would not shape themselves.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51842' title='51842'>'That's the hand I play from,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='51843' title='51843'>'I put it all upon the table. </span>
<span sid='51844' title='51844'>But one card is missing. </span>
<span sid='51845' title='51845'>It's the King of Diamonds. </span>
<span sid='51846' title='51846'>I don't know where the stone is.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51847' title='51847'>'You never shall know.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51848' title='51848'>'No? </span>
<span sid='51849' title='51849'>Now, be reasonable, Count. </span>
<span sid='51850' title='51850'>Consider the situation. </span>
<span sid='51851' title='51851'>You are going to be locked up for twenty years. </span>
<span sid='51852' title='51852'>So is Sam Merton. </span>
<span sid='51853' title='51853'>What good are you going to get out of your diamond? </span>
<span sid='51854' title='51854'>None in the world. </span>
<span sid='51855' title='51855'>But if you hand it over - well, I'll compound a felony. </span>
<span sid='51856' title='51856'>We don't want you or Sam. </span>
<span sid='51857' title='51857'>We want the stone. </span>
<span sid='51858' title='51858'>Give that up, and so far as I am concerned you can go free so long as you behave yourself in the future. </span>
<span sid='51859' title='51859'>If you make another slip - well, it will be the last. </span>
<span sid='51860' title='51860'>But this time my commission is to get the stone, not you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51861' title='51861'>'But if I refuse?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51862' title='51862'>'Why, then - alas! - it must be you and not the stone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51863' title='51863'>Billy had appeared in answer to a ring.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51864' title='51864'>'I think, Count, that it would be as well to have your friend Sam at this conference. </span>
<span sid='51865' title='51865'>After all, his interests should be represented. </span>
<span sid='51866' title='51866'>Billy, you will see a large and ugly gentleman outside the front door. </span>
<span sid='51867' title='51867'>Ask him to come up.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51868' title='51868'>'If he won't come, sir?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51869' title='51869'>'No violence, Billy. </span>
<span sid='51870' title='51870'>Don't be rough with him. </span>
<span sid='51871' title='51871'>If you tell him that Count Sylvius wants him he will certainly come.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51872' title='51872'>'What are you going to do now?' asked the Count, as Billy disappeared.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51873' title='51873'>'My friend Watson was with me just now. </span>
<span sid='51874' title='51874'>I told him that I had a shark and a gudgeon in my net, now I am drawing the net and up they come together.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51875' title='51875'>The Count had risen from his chair, and his hand was behind his back. </span>
<span sid='51876' title='51876'>Holmes held something half protruding from the pocket of his dressing-gown.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51877' title='51877'>'You won't die in your bed, Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51878' title='51878'>'I have often had the same idea. </span>
<span sid='51879' title='51879'>Does it matter very much? </span>
<span sid='51880' title='51880'>After all, Count, your own exit is more likely to be perpendicular than horizontal. </span>
<span sid='51881' title='51881'>But these anticipations of the future are morbid. </span>
<span sid='51882' title='51882'>Why not give ourselves up to the unrestrained enjoyment of the present?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51883' title='51883'>A sudden wild-beast light sprang up in the dark, menacing eyes of the master criminal. </span>
<span sid='51884' title='51884'>Holmes's figure seemed to grow taller as he grew tense and ready.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51885' title='51885'>'It is no use your fingering your revolver, my friend,' he said, in a quiet voice. </span>
<span sid='51886' title='51886'>'You know perfectly well that you dare not use it, even if I gave you time to draw it. </span>
<span sid='51887' title='51887'>Nasty, noisy things, revolvers, Count. </span>
<span sid='51888' title='51888'>Better stick to air-guns. </span>
<span sid='51889' title='51889'>Ah! </span>
<span sid='51890' title='51890'>I think I hear the fairy footstep of your estimable partner. </span>
<span sid='51891' title='51891'>Good day, Mr Merton. </span>
<span sid='51892' title='51892'>Rather dull in the street, is it not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51893' title='51893'>The prize-fighter, a heavily built young man with a stupid, obstinate, slab-sided face, stood awkwardly at the door, looking about him with a puzzled expression. </span>
<span sid='51894' title='51894'>Holmes's debonair manner was a new experience, and though he vaguely felt that it was hostile, he did not know how to counter it. </span>
<span sid='51895' title='51895'>He turned to his more astute comrade for help.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51896' title='51896'>'What's the game now, Count? </span>
<span sid='51897' title='51897'>What's this fellow want? </span>
<span sid='51898' title='51898'>What's up?' </span>
<span sid='51899' title='51899'>His voice was deep and raucous.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51900' title='51900'>The Count shrugged his shoulders and it was Holmes who answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51901' title='51901'>'If I may put it in a nutshell, Mr Merton, I should say it was all up.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51902' title='51902'>The boxer still addressed his remarks to his associate.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51903' title='51903'>'Is this cove trying to be funny, or what? </span>
<span sid='51904' title='51904'>I'm not in the funny mood myself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51905' title='51905'>'No, I expect not,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='51906' title='51906'>'I think I can promise you that you will feel even less humorous as the evening advances. </span>
<span sid='51907' title='51907'>Now, look here, Count Sylvius. </span>
<span sid='51908' title='51908'>I'm a busy man and I can't waste time. </span>
<span sid='51909' title='51909'>I'm going into that bedroom. </span>
<span sid='51910' title='51910'>Pray make yourselves quite at home in my absence. </span>
<span sid='51911' title='51911'>You can explain to your friend how the matter lies without the restraint of my presence. </span>
<span sid='51912' title='51912'>I shall try over the Hoffmann Barcarolle upon my violin. </span>
<span sid='51913' title='51913'>In five minutes I shall return for your final answer. </span>
<span sid='51914' title='51914'>You quite grasp the alternative, do you not? </span>
<span sid='51915' title='51915'>Shall we take you, or shall we have the stone?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51916' title='51916'>Holmes withdrew, picking up his violin from the corner as he passed. </span>
<span sid='51917' title='51917'>A few moments later the long-drawn, wailing notes of that most haunting of tunes came faintly through the closed door of the bedroom.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51918' title='51918'>'What is it, then?' asked Merton anxiously, as his companion turned to him. </span>
<span sid='51919' title='51919'>'Does he know about the stone?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51920' title='51920'>'He knows a damned sight too much about it. </span>
<span sid='51921' title='51921'>I'm not sure that he doesn't know all about it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51922' title='51922'>'Good Lord!' </span>
<span sid='51923' title='51923'>The boxer's sallow face turned a shade whiter.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51924' title='51924'>'Ikey Sanders has split on us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51925' title='51925'>'He has, has he? </span>
<span sid='51926' title='51926'>I'll do him down a thick 'un for that if I swing for it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51927' title='51927'>'That won't help us much. </span>
<span sid='51928' title='51928'>We've got to make up our minds what to do.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51929' title='51929'>'Half a mo',' said the boxer, looking suspiciously at the bedroom door. </span>
<span sid='51930' title='51930'>'He's a leary cove that wants watching. </span>
<span sid='51931' title='51931'>I suppose he's not listening?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51932' title='51932'>'How can he be listening with that music going?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51933' title='51933'>'That's right. </span>
<span sid='51934' title='51934'>Maybe somebody's behind a curtain. </span>
<span sid='51935' title='51935'>Too many curtains in this room.' </span>
<span sid='51936' title='51936'>As he looked round he suddenly saw for the first time the effigy in the window, and stood staring and pointing, too amazed for words.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51937' title='51937'>'Tut! it's only a dummy,' said the Count.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51938' title='51938'>'A fake, is it? </span>
<span sid='51939' title='51939'>Well, strike me! </span>
<span sid='51940' title='51940'>Madame Tussaud ain't in it. </span>
<span sid='51941' title='51941'>It's the living spit of him, gown and all. </span>
<span sid='51942' title='51942'>But them curtains, Count!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51943' title='51943'>'Oh, confound the curtains! </span>
<span sid='51944' title='51944'>We are wasting our time, and there is none too much. </span>
<span sid='51945' title='51945'>He can lag us over this stone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51946' title='51946'>'The deuce he can!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51947' title='51947'>'But he'll let us slip if we only tell him where the swag is.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51948' title='51948'>'What! </span>
<span sid='51949' title='51949'>Give it up? </span>
<span sid='51950' title='51950'>Give up a hundred thousand quid?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51951' title='51951'>'It's one or the other.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51952' title='51952'>Merton scratched his short-cropped pate.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51953' title='51953'>'He's alone in there. </span>
<span sid='51954' title='51954'>Let's do him in. </span>
<span sid='51955' title='51955'>If his light were out we should have nothing to fear.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51956' title='51956'>The Count shook his head.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51957' title='51957'>'He is armed and ready. </span>
<span sid='51958' title='51958'>If we shot him we could hardly get away in a place like this. </span>
<span sid='51959' title='51959'>Besides, it's likely enough that the police know whatever evidence he has got. </span>
<span sid='51960' title='51960'>Hallo! </span>
<span sid='51961' title='51961'>What was that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51962' title='51962'>There was a vague sound which seemed to come from the window. </span>
<span sid='51963' title='51963'>Both men sprang round, but all was quiet. </span>
<span sid='51964' title='51964'>Save for the one strange figure seated in the chair, the room was certainly empty.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51965' title='51965'>'Something in the street,' said Merton. </span>
<span sid='51966' title='51966'>'Now look here, guv'nor, you've got the brains. </span>
<span sid='51967' title='51967'>Surely you can think a way out of it. </span>
<span sid='51968' title='51968'>If slugging is no use, then it's up to you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51969' title='51969'>'I've fooled better men than he,' the Count answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51970' title='51970'>'The stone is here in my secret pocket. </span>
<span sid='51971' title='51971'>I take no chances leaving it about. </span>
<span sid='51972' title='51972'>It can be out of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> to-night and cut into four pieces in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Amsterdam&t=h'>Amsterdam</a> before Sunday. </span>
<span sid='51973' title='51973'>He knows nothing of Van Seddar.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51974' title='51974'>'I thought Van Seddar was going next week.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51975' title='51975'>'He was. </span>
<span sid='51976' title='51976'>But now he must get off by the next boat. </span>
<span sid='51977' title='51977'>One or other of us must slip round with the stone to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lime Street&t=h'>Lime Street</a> and tell him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51978' title='51978'>'But the false bottom ain't ready.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51979' title='51979'>'Well, he must take it as it is and chance it. </span>
<span sid='51980' title='51980'>There's not a moment to lose.' </span>
<span sid='51981' title='51981'>Again, with the sense of danger which becomes an instinct with the sportsman, he paused and looked hard at the window. </span>
<span sid='51982' title='51982'>Yes, it was surely from the street that the faint sound had come.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51983' title='51983'>'As to Holmes,' he continued, 'we can fool him easily enough. </span>
<span sid='51984' title='51984'>You see, the damned fool won't arrest us if he can get the stone. </span>
<span sid='51985' title='51985'>Well, we'll promise him the stone. </span>
<span sid='51986' title='51986'>We'll put him on the wrong track about it, and before he finds that it is the wrong track it will be in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Holland&t=h'>Holland</a> and we out of the country.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51987' title='51987'>'That sounds good to me!' said Sam Merton, with a grin.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51988' title='51988'>'You go on and tell the Dutchman to get a move on him. </span>
<span sid='51989' title='51989'>I'll see this sucker and fill him up with a bogus confession. </span>
<span sid='51990' title='51990'>I'll tell him that the stone is in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Liverpool&t=h'>Liverpool</a>. </span>
<span sid='51991' title='51991'>Confound that whining music, it gets on my nerves! </span>
<span sid='51992' title='51992'>By the time he finds it isn't in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Liverpool&t=h'>Liverpool</a> it will be in quarters and we on the blue water. </span>
<span sid='51993' title='51993'>Come back here, out of a line with that keyhole. </span>
<span sid='51994' title='51994'>Here is the stone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51995' title='51995'>'I wonder you dare carry it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51996' title='51996'>'Where could I have it safer? </span>
<span sid='51997' title='51997'>If we could take it out of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Whitehall&t=h'>Whitehall</a> someone else could surely take it out of my lodgings.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51998' title='51998'>'Let's have a look at it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51999' title='51999'>Count Sylvius cast a somewhat unflattering glance at his associate, and disregarded the unwashed hand which was extended towards him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52000' title='52000'>'What - d'ye think I'm going to snatch it off you? </span>
<span sid='52001' title='52001'>See here, mister, I'm getting a bit tired of your ways.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52002' title='52002'>'Well, well, no offence, Sam. </span>
<span sid='52003' title='52003'>We can't afford to quarrel. </span>
<span sid='52004' title='52004'>Come over to the window if you want to see the beauty properly. </span>
<span sid='52005' title='52005'>Now hold it to the light! </span>
<span sid='52006' title='52006'>Here!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52007' title='52007'>'Thank you!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52008' title='52008'>With a single spring Holmes had leaped from the dummy's chair and had grasped the precious jewel. </span>
<span sid='52009' title='52009'>He held it now in one hand, while his other pointed a revolver at the Count's head. </span>
<span sid='52010' title='52010'>The two villains staggered back in utter amazement. </span>
<span sid='52011' title='52011'>Before they had recovered Holmes had pressed the electric bell.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52012' title='52012'>'No violence, gentlemen - no violence, I beg of you! </span>
<span sid='52013' title='52013'>Consider the furniture! </span>
<span sid='52014' title='52014'>It must be very clear to you that your position is an impossible one. </span>
<span sid='52015' title='52015'>The police are waiting below.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52016' title='52016'>The Count's bewilderment overmastered his rage and fear.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52017' title='52017'>'But how the deuce-?' he gasped.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52018' title='52018'>'Your surprise is very natural. </span>
<span sid='52019' title='52019'>You are not aware that a second door from my bedroom leads behind that curtain. </span>
<span sid='52020' title='52020'>I fancied that you must have heard me when I displaced the figure, but luck was on my side. </span>
<span sid='52021' title='52021'>It gave me a chance of listening to your racy conversation, which would have been painfully constrained had you been aware of my presence.' </span>
<span sid='52022' title='52022'>The Count gave a gesture of resignation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52023' title='52023'>'We give you best, Holmes. </span>
<span sid='52024' title='52024'>I believe you are the devil himself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52025' title='52025'>'Not far from him, at any rate,' Holmes answered, with a polite smile.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52026' title='52026'>Sam Merton's slow intellect had only gradually appreciated the situation. </span>
<span sid='52027' title='52027'>Now, as the sound of heavy steps came from the stairs outside, he broke silence at last.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52028' title='52028'>'A fair cop!' said he. </span>
<span sid='52029' title='52029'>'But, I say, what about that bloomin' fiddle! </span>
<span sid='52030' title='52030'>I hear it yet.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52031' title='52031'>'Tut, tut!' Holmes answered. </span>
<span sid='52032' title='52032'>'You are perfectly right. </span>
<span sid='52033' title='52033'>Let it play! </span>
<span sid='52034' title='52034'>These modern gramophones are a remarkable invention.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52035' title='52035'>There was an inrush of police, the handcuffs clicked, and the criminals were led to the waiting cab. </span>
<span sid='52036' title='52036'>Watson lingered with Holmes, congratulating him upon this fresh leaf added to his laurels. </span>
<span sid='52037' title='52037'>Once more their conversation was interrupted by the imperturbable Billy with his card-tray.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52038' title='52038'>'Lord Cantlemere, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52039' title='52039'>'Show him up, Billy. </span>
<span sid='52040' title='52040'>This is the eminent peer who represents the very highest interests,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='52041' title='52041'>'He is an excellent and loyal person, but rather of the old régime. </span>
<span sid='52042' title='52042'>Shall we make him unbend? </span>
<span sid='52043' title='52043'>Dare we venture upon a slight liberty? </span>
<span sid='52044' title='52044'>He knows, we may conjecture, nothing of what has occurred.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52045' title='52045'>The door opened to admit a thin, austere figure with a hatchet face and drooping mid-<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Victoria&t=h'>Victoria</a>n whiskers of a glossy blackness which hardly corresponded with the rounded shoulders and feeble gait. </span>
<span sid='52046' title='52046'>Holmes advanced affably, and shook an unresponsive hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52047' title='52047'>'How do you do, Lord Cantlemere? </span>
<span sid='52048' title='52048'>It is chilly, for the time of year, but rather warm indoors. </span>
<span sid='52049' title='52049'>May I take your overcoat?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52050' title='52050'>'No, I thank you, I will not take it off.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52051' title='52051'>Holmes laid his hand insistently upon the sleeve.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52052' title='52052'>'Pray allow me! </span>
<span sid='52053' title='52053'>My friend Dr Watson would assure you that these changes of temperature are most insidious.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52054' title='52054'>His lordship shook himself free with some impatience.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52055' title='52055'>'I am quite comfortable, sir. </span>
<span sid='52056' title='52056'>I have no need to stay. </span>
<span sid='52057' title='52057'>I have simply looked in to know how your self-appointed task was progressing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52058' title='52058'>'It is difficult - very difficult.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52059' title='52059'>'I feared that you would find it so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52060' title='52060'>There was a distinct sneer in the old courtier's words and manner.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52061' title='52061'>'Every man finds his limitations, Mr Holmes, but at least it cures us of the weakness of self-satisfaction.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52062' title='52062'>'Yes, sir, I have been much perplexed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52063' title='52063'>'No doubt.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52064' title='52064'>'Especially upon one point. </span>
<span sid='52065' title='52065'>Possibly you could help me upon it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52066' title='52066'>'You apply for my advice rather late in the day. </span>
<span sid='52067' title='52067'>I thought that you had your own all-sufficient methods. </span>
<span sid='52068' title='52068'>Still, I am ready to help you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52069' title='52069'>'You see, Lord Cantlemere, we can no doubt frame a case against the actual thieves.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52070' title='52070'>'When you have caught them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52071' title='52071'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='52072' title='52072'>But the question is - how shall we proceed against the receiver?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52073' title='52073'>'Is this not rather premature?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52074' title='52074'>'It is as well to have our plans ready. </span>
<span sid='52075' title='52075'>Now, what would you regard as final evidence against the receiver?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52076' title='52076'>'The actual possession of the stone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52077' title='52077'>'You would arrest him upon that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52078' title='52078'>'Most undoubtedly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52079' title='52079'>Holmes seldom laughed, but he got as near it as his old friend Watson could remember.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52080' title='52080'>'In that case, my dear sir, I shall be under the painful necessity of advising your arrest.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52081' title='52081'>Lord Cantlemere was very angry. </span>
<span sid='52082' title='52082'>Some of the ancient fires flickered up into his sallow cheeks.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52083' title='52083'>'You take a great liberty, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='52084' title='52084'>In fifty years of official life I cannot recall such a case. </span>
<span sid='52085' title='52085'>I am a busy man, sir, engaged upon important affairs, and I have no time or taste for foolish jokes. </span>
<span sid='52086' title='52086'>I may tell you frankly, sir, that I have never been a believer in your powers, and that I have always been of the opinion that the matter was far safer in the hands of the regular police force. </span>
<span sid='52087' title='52087'>Your conduct confirms all my conclusions. </span>
<span sid='52088' title='52088'>I have the honour, sir, to wish you good evening.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52089' title='52089'>Holmes had swiftly changed his position and was between the peer and the door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52090' title='52090'>'One moment, sir,' said he. </span>
<span sid='52091' title='52091'>'To actually go off with the Mazarin stone would be a more serious offence than to be found in temporary possession of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52092' title='52092'>'Sir, this is intolerable! </span>
<span sid='52093' title='52093'>Let me pass.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52094' title='52094'>'Put your hand in the right-hand pocket of your overcoat.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52095' title='52095'>'What do you mean, sir?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52096' title='52096'>'Come - come, do what I ask.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52097' title='52097'>An instant later the amazed peer was standing, blinking and stammering, with the great yellow stone on his shaking palm.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52098' title='52098'>'What! </span>
<span sid='52099' title='52099'>What! </span>
<span sid='52100' title='52100'>How is this, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52101' title='52101'>'Too bad, Lord Cantlemere, too bad!' cried Holmes. </span>
<span sid='52102' title='52102'>'My old friend here will tell you that I have an impish habit of practical joking. </span>
<span sid='52103' title='52103'>Also that I can never resist a dramatic situation. </span>
<span sid='52104' title='52104'>I took the liberty - the very great liberty, I admit - of putting the stone into your pocket at the beginning of our interview.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52105' title='52105'>The old peer stared from the stone to the smiling face before him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52106' title='52106'>'Sir, I am bewildered. </span>
<span sid='52107' title='52107'>But - yes - it is indeed the Mazarin stone. </span>
<span sid='52108' title='52108'>We are greatly your debtors, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='52109' title='52109'>Your sense of humour may, as you admit, be somewhat perverted, and its exhibition remarkably untimely, but at least I withdraw any reflection I have made upon your amazing professional powers. </span>
<span sid='52110' title='52110'>But how-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52111' title='52111'>'The case is but half finished, the details can wait. </span>
<span sid='52112' title='52112'>No doubt, Lord Cantlemere, your pleasure in telling of this successful result in the exalted circle to which you return will be some small atonement for my practical joke. </span>
<span sid='52113' title='52113'>Billy, you will show his lordship out, and tell Mrs Hudson that I should be glad if she would send up dinner for two as soon as possible.'</span>
