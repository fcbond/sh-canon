<h1><span sid='50314' title='50314'>The Adventure of the Yellow Face</span></h1>
<p class="subtitle">Arthur Conan Doyle<label for="sn-meta-yell" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-meta-yell" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><!--googleoff: all--><b>Story Number</b>: 17<br><b>Published in</b>: The Strand Magazine in February 1893<br><b>Collected in</b>: The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes<!--googleon: all--></span></p>
<p>
<span sid='50315' title='50315'>In publishing these short sketches, based upon the numerous cases in which my companion's singular gifts have made me the listener to, and eventually the actor in some strange drama, it is only natural that I should dwell rather upon his successes than upon his failures. </span>
<span sid='50316' title='50316'>And this is not so much for the sake of his reputation, for indeed it was when he was at his wits' end that his energy and his versatility were most admirable, but because where he failed it happened too often that no one else succeeded, and that the tale was left for ever without a conclusion. </span>
<span sid='50317' title='50317'>Now and again, however, it chanced that even when he erred the truth was still discovered. </span>
<span sid='50318' title='50318'>I have notes of some half-dozen cases of the kind, of which the affair of the second stain, and that which I am now about to recount, are the two which present the strongest features of interest.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50319' title='50319'>Sherlock Holmes was a man who seldom took exercise for exercise's sake. </span>
<span sid='50320' title='50320'>Few men were capable of greater muscular effort, and he was undoubtedly one of the finest boxers of his weight that I have ever seen; but he looked upon aimless bodily exertion as a waste of energy, and he seldom bestirred himself save where there was some professional object to be served. </span>
<span sid='50321' title='50321'>Then he was absolutely untiring and indefatigable. </span>
<span sid='50322' title='50322'>That he should have kept himself in training under such circumstances is remarkable, but his diet was usually of the sparest, and his habits were simple to the verge of austerity. </span>
<span sid='50323' title='50323'>Save for the occasional use of cocaine he had no vices, and he only turned to the drug as a protest against the monotony of existence when cases were scanty and the papers uninteresting.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50324' title='50324'>One day in early spring he had so far relaxed as to go for a walk with me in the Park, where the first faint shoots of green were breaking out upon the elms, and the sticky spearheads of the chestnuts were just beginning to burst into their five-fold leaves. </span>
<span sid='50325' title='50325'>For two hours we rambled about together, in silence for the most part, as befits two men who know each other intimately. </span>
<span sid='50326' title='50326'>It was nearly five before we were back in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> once more.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50327' title='50327'>'Beg pardon, sir,' said our page-boy, as he opened the door; 'there's been a gentleman here asking for you, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50328' title='50328'>Holmes glanced reproachfully at me. </span>
<span sid='50329' title='50329'>'So much for afternoon walks!' said he. </span>
<span sid='50330' title='50330'>'Has this gentleman gone, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50331' title='50331'>'Yes, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50332' title='50332'>'Didn't you ask him in?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50333' title='50333'>'Yes, sir; he came in.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50334' title='50334'>'How long did he wait?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50335' title='50335'>'Half an hour, sir. </span>
<span sid='50336' title='50336'>He was a very restless gentleman, sir, a walkin' and a stampin' all the time he was here. </span>
<span sid='50337' title='50337'>I was waitin' outside the door, sir, and I could hear him. </span>
<span sid='50338' title='50338'>At last he goes out into the passage and he cries: "Is that man never goin' to come?" </span>
<span sid='50339' title='50339'>Those were his very words, sir. </span>
<span sid='50340' title='50340'>"You'll only need to wait a little longer," says I. </span>
<span sid='50341' title='50341'>"Then I'll wait in the open air, for I feel half choked," says he. </span>
<span sid='50342' title='50342'>"I'll be back before long," and with that he ups and he outs, and all I could say wouldn't hold him back.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50343' title='50343'>'Well, well, you did your best,' said Holmes, as we walked into our room. </span>
<span sid='50344' title='50344'>'It's very annoying though, Watson. </span>
<span sid='50345' title='50345'>I was badly in need of a case, and this looks, from the man's impatience, as if it were of importance. </span>
<span sid='50346' title='50346'>Hullo! that's not your pipe on the table! </span>
<span sid='50347' title='50347'>He must have left his behind him. </span>
<span sid='50348' title='50348'>A nice old briar, with a good long stem of what the tobacconists call amber. </span>
<span sid='50349' title='50349'>I wonder how many real amber mouthpieces there are in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='50350' title='50350'>Some people think a fly in it is a sign. </span>
<span sid='50351' title='50351'>Why, it is quite a branch of trade, the putting of sham flies into the sham amber. </span>
<span sid='50352' title='50352'>Well, he must have been disturbed in his mind to leave a pipe behind him which he evidently values highly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50353' title='50353'>'How do you know that he values it highly?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50354' title='50354'>'Well, I should put the original cost of the pipe at seven-and-sixpence. </span>
<span sid='50355' title='50355'>Now it has, you see, been twice mended: once in the wooden stem and once in the amber. </span>
<span sid='50356' title='50356'>Each of these mends, done, as you observe, with silver bands, must have cost more than the pipe did originally. </span>
<span sid='50357' title='50357'>The man must value the pipe highly when he prefers to patch it up rather than buy a new one with the same money.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50358' title='50358'>'Anything else?' I asked, for Holmes was turning the pipe about in his hand and staring at it in his peculiar, pensive way.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50359' title='50359'>He held it up and tapped on it with his long, thin fore-finger as a professor might who was lecturing on a bone.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50360' title='50360'>'Pipes are occasionally of extraordinary interest,' said he. </span>
<span sid='50361' title='50361'>'Nothing has more individuality save, perhaps, watches and bootlaces. </span>
<span sid='50362' title='50362'>The indications here, however, are neither very marked nor very important. </span>
<span sid='50363' title='50363'>The owner is obviously a muscular man, left-handed, with an excellent set of teeth, careless in his habits, and with no need to practise economy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50364' title='50364'>My friend threw out the information in a very off-hand way, but I saw that he cocked his eye at me to see if I had followed his reasoning.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50365' title='50365'>'You think a man must be well-to-do if he smokes a seven-shilling pipe?' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50366' title='50366'>'This is Grosvenor mixture at eightpence an ounce,' Holmes answered, knocking a little out on his palm. </span>
<span sid='50367' title='50367'>'As he might get an excellent smoke for half the price, he has no need to practise economy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50368' title='50368'>'And the other points?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50369' title='50369'>'He has been in the habit of lighting his pipe at lamps and gas-jets. </span>
<span sid='50370' title='50370'>You can see that it is quite charred all down one side. </span>
<span sid='50371' title='50371'>Of course, a match could not have done that. </span>
<span sid='50372' title='50372'>Why should a man hold a match to the side of his pipe? </span>
<span sid='50373' title='50373'>But you cannot light it at a lamp without getting the bowl charred. </span>
<span sid='50374' title='50374'>And it is all on the right side of the pipe. </span>
<span sid='50375' title='50375'>From that I gather that he is a left-handed man. </span>
<span sid='50376' title='50376'>You hold your own pipe to the lamp, and see how naturally you, being right-handed, hold the left side to the flame. </span>
<span sid='50377' title='50377'>You might do it once the other way, but not as a constancy. </span>
<span sid='50378' title='50378'>This has always been held so. </span>
<span sid='50379' title='50379'>Then he has bitten through his amber. </span>
<span sid='50380' title='50380'>It takes a muscular, energetic fellow, and one with a good set of teeth to do that. </span>
<span sid='50381' title='50381'>But if I am not mistaken I hear him upon the stair, so we shall have something more interesting than his pipe to study.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50382' title='50382'>An instant later our door opened, and a tall young man entered the room. </span>
<span sid='50383' title='50383'>He was well but quietly dressed in a dark-grey suit, and carried a brown wide-awake in his hand. </span>
<span sid='50384' title='50384'>I should have put him at about thirty, though he was really some years older.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50385' title='50385'>'I beg your pardon,' said he, with some embarrassment; 'I suppose I should have knocked. </span>
<span sid='50386' title='50386'>Yes, of course I should have knocked. </span>
<span sid='50387' title='50387'>The fact is that I am a little upset, and you must put it all down to that.' </span>
<span sid='50388' title='50388'>He passed his hand over his forehead like a man who is half dazed, and then fell, rather than sat, down upon a chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50389' title='50389'>'I can see that you have not slept for a night or two,' said Holmes, in his easy, genial way. </span>
<span sid='50390' title='50390'>'That tries a man's nerves more than work, and more even than pleasure. </span>
<span sid='50391' title='50391'>May I ask how I can help you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50392' title='50392'>'I wanted your advice, sir. </span>
<span sid='50393' title='50393'>I don't know what to do, and my whole life seems to have gone to pieces.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50394' title='50394'>'You wish to employ me as a consulting detective?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50395' title='50395'>'Not that only. </span>
<span sid='50396' title='50396'>I want your opinion as a judicious man-as a man of the world. </span>
<span sid='50397' title='50397'>I want to know what I ought to do next. </span>
<span sid='50398' title='50398'>I hope to God you'll be able to tell me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50399' title='50399'>He spoke in little, sharp, jerky outbursts, and it seemed to me that to speak at all was very painful to him, and that his will all through was overriding his inclinations.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50400' title='50400'>'It's a very delicate thing,' said he. </span>
<span sid='50401' title='50401'>'One does not like to speak of one's domestic affairs to strangers. </span>
<span sid='50402' title='50402'>It seems dreadful to discuss the conduct of one's wife with two men whom I have never seen before. </span>
<span sid='50403' title='50403'>It's horrible to have to do it. </span>
<span sid='50404' title='50404'>But I've got to the end of my tether, and I must have advice.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50405' title='50405'>'My dear Mr Grant Munro-' began Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50406' title='50406'>Our visitor sprang from his chair. </span>
<span sid='50407' title='50407'>'What!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='50408' title='50408'>'You know my name?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50409' title='50409'>'If you wish to preserve your incognito,' said Holmes, smiling, 'I should suggest that you cease to write your name upon the lining of your hat, or else that you turn the crown towards the person whom you are addressing. </span>
<span sid='50410' title='50410'>I was about to say that my friend and I have listened to many strange secrets in this room, and that we have had the good fortune to bring peace to many troubled souls. </span>
<span sid='50411' title='50411'>I trust that we may do as much for you. </span>
<span sid='50412' title='50412'>Might I beg you, as time may prove to be of importance, to furnish me with the facts of your case without further delay?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50413' title='50413'>Our visitor again passed his hand over his forehead as if he found it bitterly hard. </span>
<span sid='50414' title='50414'>From every gesture and expression I could see that he was a reserved, self-contained man, with a dash of pride in his nature, more likely to hide his wounds than to expose them. </span>
<span sid='50415' title='50415'>Then suddenly, with a fierce gesture of his closed hand, like one who throws reserve to the winds, he began.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50416' title='50416'>'The facts are these, Mr Holmes,' said he. </span>
<span sid='50417' title='50417'>'I am a married man, and have been so for three years. </span>
<span sid='50418' title='50418'>During that time my wife and I have loved each other as fondly, and lived as happily, as any two that ever were joined. </span>
<span sid='50419' title='50419'>We have not had a difference, not one, in thought, or word, or deed. </span>
<span sid='50420' title='50420'>And now, since last Monday, there has suddenly sprung up a barrier between us, and I find that there is something in her life and in her thoughts of which I know as little as if she were the woman who brushes by me in the street. </span>
<span sid='50421' title='50421'>We are estranged, and I want to know why.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50422' title='50422'>'Now there is one thing I want to impress upon you before I go any further, Mr Holmes: Effie loves me. </span>
<span sid='50423' title='50423'>Don't let there be any mistake about that. </span>
<span sid='50424' title='50424'>She loves me with her whole heart and soul, and never more than now. </span>
<span sid='50425' title='50425'>I know it, I feel it. </span>
<span sid='50426' title='50426'>I don't want to argue about that. </span>
<span sid='50427' title='50427'>A man can tell easily enough when a woman loves him. </span>
<span sid='50428' title='50428'>But there's this secret between us, and we can never be the same until it is cleared.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50429' title='50429'>'Kindly let me have the facts, Mr Munro,' said Holmes, with some impatience.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50430' title='50430'>'I'll tell you what I know about Effie's history. </span>
<span sid='50431' title='50431'>She was a widow when I met her first, though quite young - only twenty-five. </span>
<span sid='50432' title='50432'>Her name then was Mrs Hebron. </span>
<span sid='50433' title='50433'>She went out to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a> when she was young and lived in the town of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Atlanta&t=h'>Atlanta</a>, where she married this Hebron, who was a lawyer with a good practice. </span>
<span sid='50434' title='50434'>They had one child, but the yellow fever broke out badly in the place, and both husband and child died of it. </span>
<span sid='50435' title='50435'>I have seen his death certificate. </span>
<span sid='50436' title='50436'>This sickened her of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>, and she came back to live with a maiden aunt at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pinner&t=h'>Pinner</a>, in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Middlesex&t=h'>Middlesex</a>. </span>
<span sid='50437' title='50437'>I may mention that her husband had left her comfortably off, and that she had a capital of about four thousand five hundred pounds, which had been so well invested by him that it returned an average of 7 per cent. </span>
<span sid='50438' title='50438'>She had only been six months at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pinner&t=h'>Pinner</a> when I met her; we fell in love with each other, and we married a few weeks afterwards.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50439' title='50439'>'I am a hop merchant myself, and as I have an income of seven or eight hundred, we found ourselves comfortably off, and took a nice eighty-pound-a-year villa at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norbury&t=h'>Norbury</a>. </span>
<span sid='50440' title='50440'>Our little place was very countrified, considering that it is so close to town. </span>
<span sid='50441' title='50441'>We had an inn and two houses a little above us, and a single cottage at the other side of the field which faces us, and except those there were no houses until you get half-way to the station. </span>
<span sid='50442' title='50442'>My business took me into town at certain seasons, but in summer I had less to do, and then in our country home my wife and I were just as happy as could be wished. </span>
<span sid='50443' title='50443'>I tell you that there never was a shadow between us until this accursed affair began.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50444' title='50444'>'There's one thing I ought to tell you before I go further. </span>
<span sid='50445' title='50445'>When we married, my wife made over all her property to me - rather against my will, for I saw how awkward it would be if my business affairs went wrong. </span>
<span sid='50446' title='50446'>However, she would have it so, and it was done. </span>
<span sid='50447' title='50447'>Well, about six weeks ago she came to me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50448' title='50448'>'"Jack, " said she, "when you took my money you said that if ever I wanted any I was to ask you for it."</span>
<p>
<span sid='50449' title='50449'>'"Certainly," said I, "it's all your own."</span>
<p>
<span sid='50450' title='50450'>'"Well," said she, "I want a hundred pounds."</span>
<p>
<span sid='50451' title='50451'>'I was a bit staggered at this, for I had imagined it was simply a new dress or something of the kind that she was after.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50452' title='50452'>'"What on earth for?" I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50453' title='50453'>'"Oh," said she, in her playful way, "you said that you were only my banker, and bankers never ask questions, you know."</span>
<p>
<span sid='50454' title='50454'>'"If you really mean it, of course you shall have the money," said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50455' title='50455'>'"Oh, yes, I really mean it."</span>
<p>
<span sid='50456' title='50456'>'"And you won't tell me what you want it for?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='50457' title='50457'>'"Some day, perhaps, but not just at present, Jack."</span>
<p>
<span sid='50458' title='50458'>'So I had to be content with that, though it was the first time that there had ever been any secret between us. </span>
<span sid='50459' title='50459'>I gave her a cheque, and I never thought any more of the matter. </span>
<span sid='50460' title='50460'>It may have nothing to do with what came afterwards, but I thought it only right to mention it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50461' title='50461'>'Well, I told you just now that there is a cottage not far from our house. </span>
<span sid='50462' title='50462'>There is just a field between us, but to reach it you have to go along the road and then turn down a lane. </span>
<span sid='50463' title='50463'>Just beyond it is a nice little grove of Scotch firs, and I used to be very fond of strolling down there, for trees are always neighbourly kinds of things. </span>
<span sid='50464' title='50464'>The cottage had been standing empty this eight months, and it was a pity, for it was a pretty two-storied place, with an old-fashioned porch and honeysuckle about it. </span>
<span sid='50465' title='50465'>I have stood many a time and thought what a neat little homestead it would make.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50466' title='50466'>'Well, last Monday evening I was taking a stroll down that way, when I met an empty van coming up the lane, and saw a pile of carpets and things lying about on the grass-plot beside the porch. </span>
<span sid='50467' title='50467'>It was clear that the cottage had at last been let. </span>
<span sid='50468' title='50468'>I walked past it, and then stopping, as an idle man might, I ran my eye over it, and wondered what sort of folk they were who had come to live so near us. </span>
<span sid='50469' title='50469'>And as I looked I suddenly became aware that a face was watching me out of one of the upper windows.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50470' title='50470'>'I don't know what there was about that face, Mr Holmes, but it seemed to send a chill right down my back. </span>
<span sid='50471' title='50471'>I was some little way off, so that I could not make out the features, but there was something unnatural and inhuman about the face. </span>
<span sid='50472' title='50472'>That was the impression I had, and I moved quickly forwards to get a nearer view of the person who was watching me. </span>
<span sid='50473' title='50473'>But as I did so the face suddenly disappeared, so suddenly that it seemed to have been plucked away into the darkness of the room. </span>
<span sid='50474' title='50474'>I stood for five minutes thinking the business over, and trying to analyse my impressions. </span>
<span sid='50475' title='50475'>I could not tell if the face was that of a man or a woman. </span>
<span sid='50476' title='50476'>But the colour was what impressed me most. </span>
<span sid='50477' title='50477'>It was of a livid dead yellow, and with something set and rigid about it, which was shockingly unnatural. </span>
<span sid='50478' title='50478'>So disturbed was I, that I determined to see a little more of the new inmates of the cottage. </span>
<span sid='50479' title='50479'>I approached and knocked at the door, which was instantly opened by a tall, gaunt woman, with a harsh, forbidding face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50480' title='50480'>'"What may you be wantin'?" she asked, in a northern accent.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50481' title='50481'>'"I am your neighbour over yonder," said I, nodding towards my house. </span>
<span sid='50482' title='50482'>"I see that you have only just moved in, so I thought that if I could be of any help to you in any-"</span>
<p>
<span sid='50483' title='50483'>'"Aye, we'll just ask ye when we want ye," said she, and shut the door in my face. </span>
<span sid='50484' title='50484'>Annoyed at the churlish rebuff, I turned my back and walked home. </span>
<span sid='50485' title='50485'>All the evening, though I tried to think of other things, my mind would still turn to the apparition at the window and the rudeness of the woman. </span>
<span sid='50486' title='50486'>I determined to say nothing about the former to my wife, for she is a nervous, highly-strung woman, and I had no wish that she should share the unpleasant impression which had been produced upon myself. </span>
<span sid='50487' title='50487'>I remarked to her, however, before I fell asleep that the cottage was now occupied, to which she returned no reply.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50488' title='50488'>'I am usually an extremely sound sleeper. </span>
<span sid='50489' title='50489'>It has been a standing jest in the family that nothing could ever wake me during the night; and yet somehow on that particular night, whether it may have been the slight excitement produced by my little adventure or not, I know not, but I slept much more lightly than usual. </span>
<span sid='50490' title='50490'>Half in my dreams I was dimly conscious that something was going on in the room, and gradually became aware that my wife had dressed herself and was slipping on her mantle and her bonnet. </span>
<span sid='50491' title='50491'>My lips were parted to murmur out some sleepy words of surprise or remonstrance at this untimely preparation, when suddenly my half-opened eyes fell upon her face, illuminated by the candle light, and astonishment held me dumb. </span>
<span sid='50492' title='50492'>She wore an expression such as I had never seen before - such as I should have thought her incapable of assuming. </span>
<span sid='50493' title='50493'>She was deadly pale, and breathing fast, glancing furtively towards the bed, as she fastened her mantle, to see if she had disturbed me. </span>
<span sid='50494' title='50494'>Then, thinking that I was still asleep, she slipped noiselessly from the room, and an instant later I heard a sharp creaking, which could only come from the hinges of the front door. </span>
<span sid='50495' title='50495'>I sat up in bed and rapped my knuckles against the rail to make certain that I was truly awake. </span>
<span sid='50496' title='50496'>Then I took my watch from under the pillow. </span>
<span sid='50497' title='50497'>It was three in the morning. </span>
<span sid='50498' title='50498'>What on earth could my wife be doing out on the country road at three in the morning?</span>
<p>
<span sid='50499' title='50499'>'I had sat for about twenty minutes turning the thing over in my mind and trying to find some possible explanation. </span>
<span sid='50500' title='50500'>The more I thought, the more extraordinary and inexplicable did it appear. </span>
<span sid='50501' title='50501'>I was still puzzling over it when I heard the door gently close again and her footsteps coming up the stairs.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50502' title='50502'>'"Where in the world have you been, Effie?" I asked, as she entered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50503' title='50503'>'She gave a violent start and a kind of gasping cry when I spoke, and that cry and start troubled me more than all the rest, for there was something indescribably guilty about them. </span>
<span sid='50504' title='50504'>My wife had always been a woman of a frank, open nature, and it gave me a chill to see her slinking into her own room, and crying out and wincing when her own husband spoke to her.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50505' title='50505'>'"You awake, Jack?" she cried, with a nervous laugh.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50506' title='50506'>"Why, I thought that nothing could awaken you."</span>
<p>
<span sid='50507' title='50507'>'"Where have you been?" I asked, more sternly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50508' title='50508'>'"I don't wonder that you are surprised," said she, and I could see that her fingers were trembling as she undid the fastening of her mantle. </span>
<span sid='50509' title='50509'>"Why, I never remember having done such a thing in my life before. </span>
<span sid='50510' title='50510'>The fact is, that I felt as though I were choking, and had a perfect longing for a breath of fresh air. </span>
<span sid='50511' title='50511'>I really think that I should have fainted if I had not gone out. </span>
<span sid='50512' title='50512'>I stood at the door for a few minutes, and now I am quite myself again."</span>
<p>
<span sid='50513' title='50513'>'All the time that she was telling me this story she never once looked in my direction, and her voice was quite unlike her usual tones. </span>
<span sid='50514' title='50514'>It was evident to me that she was saying what was false. </span>
<span sid='50515' title='50515'>I said nothing in reply, but turned my face to the wall, sick at heart, with my mind filled with a thousand venomous doubts and suspicions. </span>
<span sid='50516' title='50516'>What was it that my wife was concealing from me? </span>
<span sid='50517' title='50517'>Where had she been during that strange expedition? </span>
<span sid='50518' title='50518'>I felt that I should have no peace until I knew, and yet I shrank from asking her again after once she had told me what was false. </span>
<span sid='50519' title='50519'>All the rest of the night I tossed and tumbled, framing theory after theory, each more unlikely than the last.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50520' title='50520'>'I should have gone to the City that day, but I was too perturbed in my mind to be able to pay attention to business matters. </span>
<span sid='50521' title='50521'>My wife seemed to be as upset as myself, and I could see from the little questioning glances which she kept shooting at me, that she understood that I disbelieved her statement, and that she was at her wits' ends what to do. </span>
<span sid='50522' title='50522'>We hardly exchanged a word during breakfast, and immediately afterwards I went out for a walk, that I might think the matter over in the fresh morning air.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50523' title='50523'>'I went as far as <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Crystal Palace&t=h'>the Crystal Palace</a>, spent an hour in the grounds, and was back in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norbury&t=h'>Norbury</a> by one o'clock. </span>
<span sid='50524' title='50524'>It happened that my way took me past the cottage, and I stopped for an instant to look at the windows and to see if I could catch a glimpse of the strange face which had stared out at me on the day before. </span>
<span sid='50525' title='50525'>As I stood there, imagine my surprise, Mr Holmes, when the door suddenly opened and my wife walked out!</span>
<p>
<span sid='50526' title='50526'>'I was struck dumb with astonishment at the sight of her, but my emotions were nothing to those which showed themselves upon her face when our eyes met. </span>
<span sid='50527' title='50527'>She seemed for an instant to wish to shrink back inside the house again, and then, seeing how useless all concealment must be, she came forward with a very white face and frightened eyes which belied the smile upon her lips.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50528' title='50528'>'"Oh, Jack!" she said, "I have just been in to see if I can be of any assistance to our new neighbours. </span>
<span sid='50529' title='50529'>Why do you look at me like that, Jack? </span>
<span sid='50530' title='50530'>You are not angry with me?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='50531' title='50531'>'"So," said I, "this is where you went during the night?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='50532' title='50532'>'"What do you mean?" she cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50533' title='50533'>'"You came here. </span>
<span sid='50534' title='50534'>I am sure of it. </span>
<span sid='50535' title='50535'>Who are these people that you should visit them at such an hour?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='50536' title='50536'>"I have not been here before."</span>
<p>
<span sid='50537' title='50537'>"How can you tell me what you know is false?" I cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50538' title='50538'>"Your very voice changes as you speak. </span>
<span sid='50539' title='50539'>When have I ever had a secret from you? </span>
<span sid='50540' title='50540'>I shall enter that cottage, and I shall probe the matter to the bottom."</span>
<p>
<span sid='50541' title='50541'>'"No, no, Jack, for God's sake!" she gasped, in incontrollable emotion. </span>
<span sid='50542' title='50542'>Then as I approached the door, she seized my sleeve and pulled me back with convulsive strength.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50543' title='50543'>'"I implore you not to do this, Jack," she cried. </span>
<span sid='50544' title='50544'>"I swear that I will tell you everything some day, but nothing but misery can come of it if you enter that cottage." </span>
<span sid='50545' title='50545'>Then, as I tried to shake her off, she clung to me in a frenzy of entreaty.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50546' title='50546'>'"Trust me, Jack!" she cried. </span>
<span sid='50547' title='50547'>"Trust me only this once. </span>
<span sid='50548' title='50548'>You will never have cause to regret it. </span>
<span sid='50549' title='50549'>You know that I would not have a secret from you if it were not for your own sake. </span>
<span sid='50550' title='50550'>Our whole lives are at stake on this. </span>
<span sid='50551' title='50551'>If you come home with me all will be well. </span>
<span sid='50552' title='50552'>If you force your way into that cottage, all is over between us."</span>
<p>
<span sid='50553' title='50553'>'There was such earnestness, such despair in her manner that her words arrested me, and I stood irresolute before the door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50554' title='50554'>'"I will trust you on one condition, and on one condition only," said I at last. </span>
<span sid='50555' title='50555'>"It is that this mystery comes to an end from now. </span>
<span sid='50556' title='50556'>You are at liberty to preserve your secret, but you must promise me that there shall be no more nightly visits, no more doings which are kept from my knowledge. </span>
<span sid='50557' title='50557'>I am willing to forget those which are passed if you will promise that there shall be no more in the future."</span>
<p>
<span sid='50558' title='50558'>"I was sure that you would trust me," she cried, with a great sigh of relief. </span>
<span sid='50559' title='50559'>"It shall be just as you wish. </span>
<span sid='50560' title='50560'>Come away, oh, come away up to the house!" </span>
<span sid='50561' title='50561'>Still plucking at my sleeve she led me away from the cottage. </span>
<span sid='50562' title='50562'>As we went I glanced back, and there was that yellow, livid face watching us out of the upper window. </span>
<span sid='50563' title='50563'>What link could there be between that creature and my wife? </span>
<span sid='50564' title='50564'>Or how could the coarse, rough woman whom I had seen the day before be connected with her? </span>
<span sid='50565' title='50565'>It was a strange puzzle, and yet I knew that my mind could never know ease again until I had solved it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50566' title='50566'>'For two days after this I stayed at home, and my wife appeared to abide loyally by our engagement, for, as far as I know, she never stirred out of the house. </span>
<span sid='50567' title='50567'>On the third day, however, I had ample evidence that her solemn promise was not enough to hold her back from this secret influence which drew her away from her husband and her duty.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50568' title='50568'>'I had gone into town on that day, but I returned by the 2.40 instead of the 3.36, which is my usual train. </span>
<span sid='50569' title='50569'>As I entered the house the maid ran into the hall with a startled face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50570' title='50570'>'"Where is your mistress?" I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50571' title='50571'>'"I think that she has gone out for a walk," she answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50572' title='50572'>'My mind was instantly filled with suspicion. </span>
<span sid='50573' title='50573'>I rushed upstairs to make sure that she was not in the house. </span>
<span sid='50574' title='50574'>As I did so I happened to glance out of one of the upper windows, and saw the maid with whom I had just been speaking running across the field in the direction of the cottage. </span>
<span sid='50575' title='50575'>Then, of course, I saw exactly what it all meant. </span>
<span sid='50576' title='50576'>My wife had gone over there and had asked the servant to call her if I should return. </span>
<span sid='50577' title='50577'>Tingling with anger, I rushed down and strode across, determined to end the matter once and for ever. </span>
<span sid='50578' title='50578'>I saw my wife and the maid hurrying back together along the lane, but I did not stop to speak with them. </span>
<span sid='50579' title='50579'>In the cottage lay the secret which was casting a shadow over my life. </span>
<span sid='50580' title='50580'>I vowed that, come what might, it should be a secret no longer. </span>
<span sid='50581' title='50581'>I did not even knock when I reached it, but turned the handle and rushed into the passage.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50582' title='50582'>'It was all still and quiet upon the ground-floor. </span>
<span sid='50583' title='50583'>In the kitchen a kettle was singing on the fire, and a large black cat lay coiled up in a basket, but there was no sign of the woman whom I had seen before. </span>
<span sid='50584' title='50584'>I ran into the other room, but it was equally deserted. </span>
<span sid='50585' title='50585'>Then I rushed up the stairs, but only to find two other rooms empty and deserted at the top. </span>
<span sid='50586' title='50586'>There was no one at all in the whole house. </span>
<span sid='50587' title='50587'>The furniture and pictures were of the most common and vulgar description, save in the one chamber at the window of which I had seen the strange face. </span>
<span sid='50588' title='50588'>That was comfortable and elegant, and all my suspicions rose into a fierce, bitter blaze when I saw that on the mantelpiece stood a full-length photograph of my wife, which had been taken at my request only three months ago.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50589' title='50589'>'I stayed long enough to make certain that the house was absolutely empty. </span>
<span sid='50590' title='50590'>Then I left it, feeling a weight at my heart such as I had never had before. </span>
<span sid='50591' title='50591'>My wife came out into the hall as I entered my house, but I was too hurt and angry to speak with her, and pushing past her I made my way into my study. </span>
<span sid='50592' title='50592'>She followed me, however, before I could close the door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50593' title='50593'>'"I am sorry that I broke my promise, Jack," said she, "but if you knew all the circumstances I am sure you would forgive me."</span>
<p>
<span sid='50594' title='50594'>'"Tell me everything, then," said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50595' title='50595'>'"I cannot, Jack, I cannot!" she cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50596' title='50596'>'"Until you tell me who it is that has been living in that cottage, and who it is to whom you have given that photograph, there can never be any confidence between us," said I, and breaking away from her I left the house. </span>
<span sid='50597' title='50597'>That was yesterday, Mr Holmes, and I have not seen her since, nor do I know anything more about this strange business. </span>
<span sid='50598' title='50598'>It is the first shadow that has come between us, and it has so shaken me that I do not know what I should do for the best. </span>
<span sid='50599' title='50599'>Suddenly this morning it occurred to me that you were the man to advise me, so I have hurried to you now, and I place myself unreservedly in your hands. </span>
<span sid='50600' title='50600'>If there is any point which I have not made clear, pray question me about it. </span>
<span sid='50601' title='50601'>But above all tell me quickly what I have to do, for this misery is more than I can bear.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50602' title='50602'>Holmes and I had listened with the utmost interest to this extraordinary statement, which had been delivered in the jerky, broken fashion of a man who is under the influence of extreme emotion. </span>
<span sid='50603' title='50603'>My companion sat silent now for some time, with his chin upon his hand, lost in thought.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50604' title='50604'>'Tell me,' said he at last, 'could you swear that this was a man's face which you saw at the window?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50605' title='50605'>'Each time that I saw it I was some distance away from it, so that it is impossible for me to say.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50606' title='50606'>'You appear, however, to have been disagreeably impressed by it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50607' title='50607'>'It seemed to be of an unnatural colour and to have a strange rigidity about the features. </span>
<span sid='50608' title='50608'>When I approached, it vanished with a jerk.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50609' title='50609'>'How long is it since your wife asked you for a hundred pounds?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50610' title='50610'>'Nearly two months.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50611' title='50611'>'Have you ever seen a photograph of her first husband?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50612' title='50612'>'No; there was a great fire at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Atlanta&t=h'>Atlanta</a> very shortly after his death, and all her papers were destroyed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50613' title='50613'>'And yet she had a certificate of death. </span>
<span sid='50614' title='50614'>You say that you saw it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50615' title='50615'>'Yes, she got a duplicate after the fire.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50616' title='50616'>'Did you ever meet anyone who knew her in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50617' title='50617'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50618' title='50618'>'Did she ever talk of revisiting the place?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50619' title='50619'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50620' title='50620'>'Or get letters from it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50621' title='50621'>'Not to my knowledge.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50622' title='50622'>'Thank you. </span>
<span sid='50623' title='50623'>I should like to think over the matter a little now. </span>
<span sid='50624' title='50624'>If the cottage is permanently deserted we may have some difficulty; if on the other hand, as I fancy is more likely, the inmates were warned of your coming, and left before you entered yesterday, then they may be back now, and we should clear it all up easily. </span>
<span sid='50625' title='50625'>Let me advise you, then, to return to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norbury&t=h'>Norbury</a> and to examine the windows of the cottage again. </span>
<span sid='50626' title='50626'>If you have reason to believe that it is inhabited do not force your way in, but send a wire to my friend and me. </span>
<span sid='50627' title='50627'>We shall be with you within an hour of receiving it, and we shall then very soon get to the bottom of the business.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50628' title='50628'>'And if it is still empty?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50629' title='50629'>'In that case I shall come out to-morrow and talk it over with you. </span>
<span sid='50630' title='50630'>Good-bye, and above all things do not fret until you know that you really have a cause for it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50631' title='50631'>'I am afraid that this is a bad business, Watson,' said my companion, as he returned after accompanying Mr Grant Munro to the door. </span>
<span sid='50632' title='50632'>'What do you make of it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50633' title='50633'>'It has an ugly sound,' I answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50634' title='50634'>'Yes. </span>
<span sid='50635' title='50635'>There's blackmail in it, or I am much mistaken.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50636' title='50636'>'And who is the blackmailer?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50637' title='50637'>'Well, it must be this creature who lives in the only comfortable room in the place, and has her photograph above his fireplace. </span>
<span sid='50638' title='50638'>Upon my word, Watson, there is something very attractive about that livid face at the window, and I would not have missed the case for worlds.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50639' title='50639'>'You have a theory?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50640' title='50640'>'Yes, a provisional one. </span>
<span sid='50641' title='50641'>But I shall be surprised if it does not turn out to be correct. </span>
<span sid='50642' title='50642'>This woman's first husband is in that cottage.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50643' title='50643'>'Why do you think so?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50644' title='50644'>'How else can we explain her frenzied anxiety that her second one should not enter it? </span>
<span sid='50645' title='50645'>The facts, as I read them, are something like this: This woman was married in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>. </span>
<span sid='50646' title='50646'>Her husband developed some hateful qualities, or, shall we say, that he contracted some loathsome disease, and became a leper or an imbecile. </span>
<span sid='50647' title='50647'>She fled from him at last, returned to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, changed her name, and started her life, as she thought, afresh. </span>
<span sid='50648' title='50648'>She had been married three years, and believed that her position was quite secure - having shown her husband the death certificate of some man, whose name she had assumed - when suddenly her whereabouts was discovered by her first husband, or, we may suppose, by some unscrupulous woman, who had attached herself to the invalid. </span>
<span sid='50649' title='50649'>They write to the wife and threaten to come and expose her. </span>
<span sid='50650' title='50650'>She asks for a hundred pounds and endeavours to buy them off. </span>
<span sid='50651' title='50651'>They come in spite of it, and when the husband mentions casually to the wife that there are new-comers in the cottage, she knows in some way that they are her pursuers. </span>
<span sid='50652' title='50652'>She waits until her husband is asleep, and then she rushes down to endeavour to persuade them to leave her in peace. </span>
<span sid='50653' title='50653'>Having no success, she goes again next morning, and her husband meets her, as he has told us, as she came out. </span>
<span sid='50654' title='50654'>She promises him then not to go there again, but two days afterwards, the hope of getting rid of those dreadful neighbours is too strong for her, and she makes another attempt, taking down with her the photograph which had probably been demanded from her. </span>
<span sid='50655' title='50655'>In the midst of this interview the maid rushes in to say that the master has come home, on which the wife, knowing that he would come straight down to the cottage, hurries the inmates out at the back door, into that grove of fir trees probably which was mentioned as standing near. </span>
<span sid='50656' title='50656'>In this way he finds the place deserted. </span>
<span sid='50657' title='50657'>I shall be very much surprised, however, if it is still so when he reconnoitres it this evening. </span>
<span sid='50658' title='50658'>What do you think of my theory?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50659' title='50659'>'It is all surmise.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50660' title='50660'>'But at least it covers all the facts. </span>
<span sid='50661' title='50661'>When new facts come to our knowledge which cannot be covered by it, it will be time enough to reconsider it. </span>
<span sid='50662' title='50662'>At present we can do nothing until we have a fresh message from our friend at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norbury&t=h'>Norbury</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50663' title='50663'>But we had not very long to wait. </span>
<span sid='50664' title='50664'>It came just as we had finished our tea. </span>
<span sid='50665' title='50665'>'The cottage is still tenanted,' it said. </span>
<span sid='50666' title='50666'>'Have seen the face again at the window. </span>
<span sid='50667' title='50667'>I'll meet the seven o'clock train, and take no steps until you arrive.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50668' title='50668'>He was waiting on the platform when we stepped out, and we could see in the light of the station lamps that he was very pale, and quivering with agitation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50669' title='50669'>'They are still there, Mr Holmes,' said he, laying his hand upon my friend's sleeve. </span>
<span sid='50670' title='50670'>'I saw lights in the cottage as I came down. </span>
<span sid='50671' title='50671'>We shall settle it now, once and for all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50672' title='50672'>'What is your plan, then?' asked Holmes, as we walked down the dark, tree-lined road.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50673' title='50673'>'I am going to force my way in and see for myself who is in the house. </span>
<span sid='50674' title='50674'>I wish you both to be there as witnesses.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50675' title='50675'>'You are quite determined to do this, in spite of your wife's warning that it is better that you should not solve the mystery?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50676' title='50676'>'Yes, I am determined.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50677' title='50677'>'Well, I think that you are in the right. </span>
<span sid='50678' title='50678'>Any truth is better than indefinite doubt. </span>
<span sid='50679' title='50679'>We had better go up at once. </span>
<span sid='50680' title='50680'>Of course, legally we are putting ourselves hopelessly in the wrong, but I think that it is worth it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50681' title='50681'>It was a very dark night and a thin rain began to fall as we turned from the high road into a narrow lane, deeply rutted, with hedges on either side. </span>
<span sid='50682' title='50682'>Mr Grant Munro pushed impatiently forward, however, and we stumbled after him as best we could.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50683' title='50683'>'There are the lights of my house,' he murmured, pointing to a glimmer among the trees, 'and here is the cottage which I am going to enter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50684' title='50684'>We turned a corner in the lane as he spoke, and there was the building close beside us. </span>
<span sid='50685' title='50685'>A yellow bar falling across the black foreground showed that the door was not quite closed, and one window in the upper story was brightly illuminated. </span>
<span sid='50686' title='50686'>As we looked we saw a dark blur moving across the blind.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50687' title='50687'>'There is that creature,' cried Grant Munro; 'you can see for yourselves that someone is there. </span>
<span sid='50688' title='50688'>Now follow me, and we shall soon know all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50689' title='50689'>We approached the door, but suddenly a woman appeared out of the shadow and stood in the golden track of the lamp-light. </span>
<span sid='50690' title='50690'>I could not see her face in the darkness, but her arms were thrown out in an attitude of entreaty.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50691' title='50691'>'For God's sake, don't, Jack!' she cried. </span>
<span sid='50692' title='50692'>'I had a presentiment that you would come this evening. </span>
<span sid='50693' title='50693'>Think better of it, dear! </span>
<span sid='50694' title='50694'>Trust me again, and you will never have cause to regret it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50695' title='50695'>'I have trusted you too long, Effie!' he cried, sternly. </span>
<span sid='50696' title='50696'>'Leave go of me! </span>
<span sid='50697' title='50697'>I must pass you. </span>
<span sid='50698' title='50698'>My friends and I are going to settle this matter once and for ever.' </span>
<span sid='50699' title='50699'>He pushed her to one side and we followed closely after him. </span>
<span sid='50700' title='50700'>As he threw the door open an elderly woman ran out in front of him and tried to bar his passage, but he thrust her back, and an instant afterwards we were all upon the stairs. </span>
<span sid='50701' title='50701'>Grant Munro rushed into the lighted room at the top, and we entered it at his heels.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50702' title='50702'>It was a cosy, well-furnished apartment, with two candles burning upon the table and two upon the mantelpiece. </span>
<span sid='50703' title='50703'>In the corner, stooping over a desk, there sat what appeared to be a little girl. </span>
<span sid='50704' title='50704'>Her face was turned away as we entered, but we could see that she was dressed in a red frock, and that she had long white gloves on. </span>
<span sid='50705' title='50705'>As she whisked round to us I gave a cry of surprise and horror. </span>
<span sid='50706' title='50706'>The face which she turned towards us was of the strangest livid tint, and the features were absolutely devoid of any expression. </span>
<span sid='50707' title='50707'>An instant later the mystery was explained. </span>
<span sid='50708' title='50708'>Holmes, with a laugh, passed his hand behind the child's ear, a mask peeled off from her countenance, and there was a little coal-black negress with all her white teeth flashing in amusement at our amazed faces. </span>
<span sid='50709' title='50709'>I burst out laughing out of sympathy with her merriment, but Grant Munro stood staring, with his hand clutching at his throat.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50710' title='50710'>'My God!' he cried, 'what can be the meaning of this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50711' title='50711'>'I will tell you the meaning of it,' cried the lady, sweeping into the room with a proud, set face. </span>
<span sid='50712' title='50712'>'You have forced me against my own judgment to tell you, and now we must both make the best of it. </span>
<span sid='50713' title='50713'>My husband died at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Atlanta&t=h'>Atlanta</a>. </span>
<span sid='50714' title='50714'>My child survived.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50715' title='50715'>'Your child!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50716' title='50716'>She drew a large silver locket from her bosom. </span>
<span sid='50717' title='50717'>'You have never seen this open.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50718' title='50718'>'I understood that it did not open.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50719' title='50719'>She touched a spring, and the front hinged back. </span>
<span sid='50720' title='50720'>There was a portrait within of a man, strikingly handsome and intelligent, but bearing unmistakable signs upon his features of his <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>n descent.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50721' title='50721'>'That is John Hebron, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Atlanta&t=h'>Atlanta</a>,' said the lady, 'and a nobler man never walked the earth. </span>
<span sid='50722' title='50722'>I cut myself off from my race in order to wed him; but never once while he lived did I for one instant regret it. </span>
<span sid='50723' title='50723'>It was our misfortune that our only child took after his people rather than mine. </span>
<span sid='50724' title='50724'>It is often so in such matches, and little Lucy is darker far than ever her father was. </span>
<span sid='50725' title='50725'>But, dark or fair, she is my own dear little girlie, and her mother's pet.' </span>
<span sid='50726' title='50726'>The little creature ran across at the words and nestled up against the lady's dress.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50727' title='50727'>'When I left her in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>,' she continued, 'it was only because her health was weak, and the change might have done her harm. </span>
<span sid='50728' title='50728'>She was given to the care of a faithful Scotchwoman who had once been our servant. </span>
<span sid='50729' title='50729'>Never for an instant did I dream of disowning her as my child. </span>
<span sid='50730' title='50730'>But when chance threw you in my way, Jack, and I learned to love you, I feared to tell you about my child. </span>
<span sid='50731' title='50731'>God forgive me, I feared that I should lose you, and I had not the courage to tell you. </span>
<span sid='50732' title='50732'>I had to choose between you, and in my weakness I turned away from my own little girl. </span>
<span sid='50733' title='50733'>For three years I have kept her existence a secret from you, but I heard from the nurse, and I knew that all was well with her. </span>
<span sid='50734' title='50734'>At last, however, there came an overwhelming desire to see the child once more. </span>
<span sid='50735' title='50735'>I struggled against it, but in vain. </span>
<span sid='50736' title='50736'>Though I knew the danger I determined to have the child over, if it were but for a few weeks. </span>
<span sid='50737' title='50737'>I sent a hundred pounds to the nurse, and I gave her instructions about this cottage, so that she might come as a neighbour without my appearing to be in any way connected with her. </span>
<span sid='50738' title='50738'>I pushed my precautions so far as to order her to keep the child in the house during the daytime, and to cover up her little face and hands, so that even those who might see her at the window should not gossip about there being a black child in the neighbourhood. </span>
<span sid='50739' title='50739'>If I had been less cautious I might have been more wise, but I was half crazy with fear lest you should learn the truth.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50740' title='50740'>'It was you who told me first that the cottage was occupied. </span>
<span sid='50741' title='50741'>I should have waited for the morning, but I could not sleep for excitement, and so at last I slipped out, knowing how difficult it is to awaken you. </span>
<span sid='50742' title='50742'>But you saw me go, and that was the beginning of my troubles. </span>
<span sid='50743' title='50743'>Next day you had my secret at your mercy, but you nobly refrained from pursuing your advantage. </span>
<span sid='50744' title='50744'>Three days later, however, the nurse and child only just escaped from the back door as you rushed in at the front one. </span>
<span sid='50745' title='50745'>And now to-night you at last know all, and I ask you what is to become of us, my child and me?' </span>
<span sid='50746' title='50746'>She clasped her hands and waited for an answer.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50747' title='50747'>It was a long two minutes before Grant Munro broke the silence, and when his answer came it was one of which I love to think. </span>
<span sid='50748' title='50748'>He lifted the little child, kissed her, and then, still carrying her, he held his other hand out to his wife, and turned towards the door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50749' title='50749'>'We can talk it over more comfortably at home,' said he. </span>
<span sid='50750' title='50750'>'I am not a very good man, Effie, but I think that I am a better one than you have given me credit for being.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50751' title='50751'>Holmes and I followed them down to the lane, and my friend plucked at my sleeve as we came out. </span>
<span sid='50752' title='50752'>'I think,' said he, 'that we shall be of more use in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> than in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norbury&t=h'>Norbury</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50753' title='50753'>Not another word did he say of the case until late that night when he was turning away, with his lighted candle, for his bedroom.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50754' title='50754'>'Watson,' said he, 'if it should ever strike you that I am getting a little over-confident in my powers, or giving less pains to a case than it deserves, kindly whisper "<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norbury&t=h'>Norbury</a>" in my ear, and I shall be infinitely obliged to you.'</span>
