<p>
<span sid='15127' title='15127'>I had intended 'The Adventure of the Abbey Grange' to be the last of those exploits of my friend, Mr Sherlock Holmes, which I should ever communicate to the public. </span>
<span sid='15128' title='15128'>This resolution of mine was not due to any lack of material, since I have notes of many hundreds of cases to which I have never alluded, nor was it caused by any waning interest on the part of my readers in the singular personality and unique methods of this remarkable man. </span>
<span sid='15129' title='15129'>The real reason lay in the reluctance which Mr Holmes has shown to the continued publication of his experiences. </span>
<span sid='15130' title='15130'>So long as he was in actual professional practice the records of his successes were of some practical value to him; but since he has definitely retired from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> and betaken himself to study and bee-farming on the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sussex&t=h'>Sussex</a> Downs, notoriety has become hateful to him, and he has peremptorily requested that his wishes in this matter should be strictly observed. </span>
<span sid='15131' title='15131'>It was only upon my representing to him that I had given a promise that The Adventure of the Second Stain' should be published when the time was ripe, and pointed out to him that it was only appropriate that this long series of episodes should culminate in the most important international case which he has ever been called upon to handle, that I at last succeeded in obtaining his consent that a carefully guarded account of the incident should at last be laid before the public. </span>
<span sid='15132' title='15132'>If in telling the story I seem to be somewhat vague in certain details the public will readily understand that there is an excellent reason for my reticence.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15133' title='15133'>It was, then, in a year, and even in a decade, that shall be nameless, that upon one Tuesday morning in autumn we found two visitors of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>an fame within the walls of our humble room in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='15134' title='15134'>The one, austere, high-nosed, eagle-eyed, and dominant, was none other than the illustrious Lord Bellinger, twice Premier of Britain. </span>
<span sid='15135' title='15135'>The other, dark, clear-cut, and elegant, hardly yet of middle age, and endowed with every beauty of body and of mind, was the Right Honourable Trelawney Hope, Secretary for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>an Affairs, and the most rising statesman in the country. </span>
<span sid='15136' title='15136'>They sat side by side upon our paper-littered settee, and it was easy to see from their worn and anxious faces that it was business of the most pressing importance which had brought them. </span>
<span sid='15137' title='15137'>The Premier's thin, blue-veined hands were clasped tightly over the ivory head of his umbrella, and his gaunt, ascetic face looked gloomily from Holmes to me. </span>
<span sid='15138' title='15138'>The <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>an Secretary pulled nervously at his moustache and fidgeted with the seals of his watch-chain.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15139' title='15139'>'When I discovered my loss, Mr Holmes, which was at eight o'clock this morning, I at once informed the Prime Minister. </span>
<span sid='15140' title='15140'>It was at his suggestion that we have both come to you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15141' title='15141'>'Have you informed the police?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15142' title='15142'>'No, sir,' said the Prime Minister, with the quick, decisive manner for which he was famous. </span>
<span sid='15143' title='15143'>'We have not done so, nor is it possible that we should do so. </span>
<span sid='15144' title='15144'>To inform the police must, in the long run, mean to inform the public. </span>
<span sid='15145' title='15145'>This is what we particularly desire to avoid.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15146' title='15146'>'And why, sir?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15147' title='15147'>'Because the document in question is of such immense importance that its publication might very easily - I might almost say probably - lead to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>an complications of the utmost moment. </span>
<span sid='15148' title='15148'>It is not too much to say that peace or war may hang upon the issue. </span>
<span sid='15149' title='15149'>Unless its recovery can be attended with the utmost secrecy, then it may as well not be recovered at all, for all that is aimed at by those who have taken it is that its contents should be generally known.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15150' title='15150'>'I understand. </span>
<span sid='15151' title='15151'>Now, Mr Trelawney Hope, I should be much obliged if you would tell me exactly the circumstances under which this document disappeared.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15152' title='15152'>'That can be done in a very few words, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='15153' title='15153'>The letter - for it was a letter from a foreign potentate - was received six days ago. </span>
<span sid='15154' title='15154'>It was of such importance that I have never left it in my safe, but I have taken it across each evening to my house in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Whitehall&t=h'>Whitehall</a> Terrace, and kept it in my bedroom in a locked dispatch-box. </span>
<span sid='15155' title='15155'>It was there last night. </span>
<span sid='15156' title='15156'>Of that I am certain. </span>
<span sid='15157' title='15157'>I actually opened the box while I was dressing for dinner, and saw the document inside. </span>
<span sid='15158' title='15158'>This morning it was gone. </span>
<span sid='15159' title='15159'>The dispatch-box had stood beside the glass upon my dressing-table all night. </span>
<span sid='15160' title='15160'>I am a light sleeper, and so is my wife. </span>
<span sid='15161' title='15161'>We are both prepared to swear that no one could have entered the room during the night. </span>
<span sid='15162' title='15162'>And yet I repeat that the paper is gone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15163' title='15163'>'What time did you dine?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15164' title='15164'>'Half-past seven.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15165' title='15165'>'How long was it before you went to bed?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15166' title='15166'>'My wife had gone to the theatre. </span>
<span sid='15167' title='15167'>I waited up for her. </span>
<span sid='15168' title='15168'>It was half-past eleven before we went to our room.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15169' title='15169'>'Then for four hours the dispatch-box had lain unguarded?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15170' title='15170'>'No one is ever permitted to enter that room save the housemaid in the morning, and my valet, or my wife's maid, during the rest of the day. </span>
<span sid='15171' title='15171'>They are both trusty servants who have been with us for some time. </span>
<span sid='15172' title='15172'>Besides, neither of them could possibly have known that there was anything more valuable than the ordinary departmental papers in my dispatch-box.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15173' title='15173'>'Who did know of the existence of that letter?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15174' title='15174'>'No one in the house.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15175' title='15175'>'Surely your wife knew?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15176' title='15176'>'No, sir; I had said nothing to my wife until I missed the paper this morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15177' title='15177'>The Premier nodded approvingly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15178' title='15178'>'I have long known, sir, how high is your sense of public duty,' said he. </span>
<span sid='15179' title='15179'>'I am convinced that in the case of a secret of this importance it would rise superior to the most intimate domestic ties.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15180' title='15180'>The <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>an Secretary bowed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15181' title='15181'>'You do me no more than justice, sir. </span>
<span sid='15182' title='15182'>Until this morning I have never breathed one word to my wife upon this matter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15183' title='15183'>'Could she have guessed?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15184' title='15184'>'No, Mr Holmes, she could not have guessed - nor could anyone have guessed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15185' title='15185'>'Have you lost any documents before?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15186' title='15186'>'No, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15187' title='15187'>'Who is there in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> who did know of the existence of this letter?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15188' title='15188'>'Each member of the Cabinet was informed of it yesterday; but the pledge of secrecy which attends every Cabinet meeting was increased by the solemn warning which was given by the Prime Minister. </span>
<span sid='15189' title='15189'>Good God, to think that within a few hours I should myself have lost it!' </span>
<span sid='15190' title='15190'>His handsome face was distorted with a spasm of despair, and his hands tore at his hair. </span>
<span sid='15191' title='15191'>For a moment we caught a glimpse of the natural man - impulsive, ardent, keenly sensitive. </span>
<span sid='15192' title='15192'>The next the aristocratic mask was replaced, and the gentle voice had returned. </span>
<span sid='15193' title='15193'>'Besides the members of the Cabinet there are two, or possibly three, departmental officials who know of the letter. </span>
<span sid='15194' title='15194'>No one else in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, Mr Holmes, I assure you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15195' title='15195'>'But abroad?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15196' title='15196'>'I believe that no one abroad has seen it save the man who wrote it. </span>
<span sid='15197' title='15197'>I am well convinced that his Ministers - that the usual official channels have not been employed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15198' title='15198'>Holmes considered for some little time.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15199' title='15199'>'Now, sir, I must ask you more particularly what this document is, and why its disappearance should have such momentous consequences?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15200' title='15200'>The two statesmen exchanged a quick glance, and the Premier's shaggy eyebrows gathered in a frown.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15201' title='15201'>'Mr Holmes, the envelope is a long, thin one of pale blue colour. </span>
<span sid='15202' title='15202'>There is a seal of red wax stamped with a crouching lion. </span>
<span sid='15203' title='15203'>It is addressed in large, bold handwriting to-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15204' title='15204'>'I fear,' said Holmes, 'that, interesting and indeed essential as these details are, my inquiries must go more to the root of things. </span>
<span sid='15205' title='15205'>What was the letter?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15206' title='15206'>'That is a State secret of the utmost importance, and I fear that I cannot tell you, nor do I see that it is necessary.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15207' title='15207'>If by the aid of the powers which you are said to possess you can find such an envelope as I describe with its enclosure, you will have deserved well of your country, and earned any reward which it lies in our power to bestow.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15208' title='15208'>Sherlock Holmes rose with a smile.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15209' title='15209'>'You are two of the most busy men in the country,' said he, 'and in my own small way I have also a good many calls upon me. </span>
<span sid='15210' title='15210'>I regret exceedingly that I cannot help you in this matter, and any continuation of this interview would be a waste of time.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15211' title='15211'>The Premier sprang to his feet with that quick, fierce gleam of his deep-set eyes before which a Cabinet had cowered. </span>
<span sid='15212' title='15212'>'I am not accustomed' he began, but mastered his anger and resumed his seat. </span>
<span sid='15213' title='15213'>For a minute or more we all sat in silence. </span>
<span sid='15214' title='15214'>Then the old statesman shrugged his shoulders.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15215' title='15215'>'We must accept your terms, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='15216' title='15216'>No doubt you are right, and it is unreasonable for us to expect you to act unless we give you our entire confidence.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15217' title='15217'>'I agree with you, sir,' said the younger statesman.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15218' title='15218'>'Then I will tell you, relying entirely upon your honour and that of your colleague, Dr Watson. </span>
<span sid='15219' title='15219'>I may appeal to your patriotism also, for I could not imagine a greater misfortune for the country than that this affair should come out.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15220' title='15220'>'You may safely trust us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15221' title='15221'>'The letter, then, is from a certain foreign potentate who has been ruffled by some recent Colonial developments of this country. </span>
<span sid='15222' title='15222'>It has been written hurriedly and upon his own responsibility entirely. </span>
<span sid='15223' title='15223'>Inquiries have shown that his Ministers know nothing of the matter. </span>
<span sid='15224' title='15224'>At the same time it is couched in so unfortunate a manner, and certain phrases in it are of so provocative a character, that its publication would undoubtedly lead to a most dangerous state of feeling in this country. </span>
<span sid='15225' title='15225'>There would be such a ferment, sir, that I do not hesitate to say that within a week of the publication of that letter this country would be involved in a great war.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15226' title='15226'>Holmes wrote a name upon a slip of paper and handed it to the Premier.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15227' title='15227'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='15228' title='15228'>It was he. </span>
<span sid='15229' title='15229'>And it is this letter - this letter which may well mean the expenditure of a thousand millions and the lives of a hundred thousand men	which has become lost in this unaccountable fashion.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15230' title='15230'>'Have you informed the sender?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15231' title='15231'>'Yes, sir, a cipher telegram has been dispatched.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15232' title='15232'>'Perhaps he desires the publication of the letter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15233' title='15233'>'No, sir, we have strong reason to believe that he already understands that he has acted in an indiscreet and hotheaded manner. </span>
<span sid='15234' title='15234'>It would be a greater blow to him and to his country than to us if this letter were to come out.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15235' title='15235'>'If this is so, whose interest is it that the letter should come out? </span>
<span sid='15236' title='15236'>Why should anyone desire to steal it or to publish it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15237' title='15237'>'There, Mr Holmes, you take me into regions of high international politics. </span>
<span sid='15238' title='15238'>But if you consider the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>an situation you will have no difficulty in perceiving the motive. </span>
<span sid='15239' title='15239'>The whole of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a> is an armed camp. </span>
<span sid='15240' title='15240'>There is a double league which makes a fair balance of military power. </span>
<span sid='15241' title='15241'><a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Great Britain&t=h'>Great Britain</a> holds the scales. </span>
<span sid='15242' title='15242'>If Britain were driven into war with one confederacy, it would assure the supremacy of the other confederacy, whether they joined in the war or not. </span>
<span sid='15243' title='15243'>Do you follow?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15244' title='15244'>'Very clearly. </span>
<span sid='15245' title='15245'>It is then the interest of the enemies of this potentate to secure and publish this letter, so as to make a breach between his country and ours?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15246' title='15246'>'Yes, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15247' title='15247'>'And to whom would this document be sent if it fell into the hands of an enemy?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15248' title='15248'>'To any of the great Chancelleries of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>. </span>
<span sid='15249' title='15249'>It is probably speeding on its way thither at the present instant as fast as steam can take it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15250' title='15250'>Mr Trelawney Hope dropped his head on his chest and groaned aloud. </span>
<span sid='15251' title='15251'>The Premier placed his hand kindly upon his shoulder.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15252' title='15252'>'It is your misfortune, my dear fellow. </span>
<span sid='15253' title='15253'>No one can blame you. </span>
<span sid='15254' title='15254'>There is no precaution which you have neglected. </span>
<span sid='15255' title='15255'>Now, Mr Holmes, you are in full possession of the facts. </span>
<span sid='15256' title='15256'>What course do you recommend?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15257' title='15257'>Holmes shook his head mournfully.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15258' title='15258'>'You think, sir, that unless this document is recovered there will be war?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15259' title='15259'>'I think it is very probable.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15260' title='15260'>'Then, sir, prepare for war.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15261' title='15261'>'That is a hard saying, Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15262' title='15262'>'Consider the facts, sir. </span>
<span sid='15263' title='15263'>It is inconceivable that it was taken after eleven-thirty at night, since I understand that Mr Hope and his wife were both in the room from that hour until the loss was found out. </span>
<span sid='15264' title='15264'>It was taken, then, yesterday evening between seven-thirty and eleven-thirty, probably near the earlier hour, since whoever took it evidently knew that it was there, and would naturally secure it as early as possible. </span>
<span sid='15265' title='15265'>Now, sir, if a document of this importance were taken at that hour, where can it be now? </span>
<span sid='15266' title='15266'>No one has any reason to retain it. </span>
<span sid='15267' title='15267'>It has been passed rapidly on to those who need it. </span>
<span sid='15268' title='15268'>What chance have we now to overtake or even to trace it? </span>
<span sid='15269' title='15269'>It is beyond our reach.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15270' title='15270'>The Prime Minister rose from the settee.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15271' title='15271'>'What you say is perfectly logical, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='15272' title='15272'>I feel that the matter is indeed out of our hands.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15273' title='15273'>'Let us presume, for argument's sake, that the document was taken by the maid or by the valet-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15274' title='15274'>'They are both old tried servants.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15275' title='15275'>'I understand you to say that your room is on the second floor, that there is no entrance from without, and that from within no one could go up unobserved. </span>
<span sid='15276' title='15276'>It must, then, be somebody in the house who has taken it. </span>
<span sid='15277' title='15277'>To whom would the thief take it? </span>
<span sid='15278' title='15278'>To one of several international spies and secret agents, whose names are tolerably familiar to me. </span>
<span sid='15279' title='15279'>There are three who may be said to be the heads of their profession. </span>
<span sid='15280' title='15280'>I will begin my research by going round and finding if each of them is at his post. </span>
<span sid='15281' title='15281'>If one is missing - especially if he had disappeared since last night - we will have some indication as to where the document has gone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15282' title='15282'>'Why should he be missing?' asked the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>an Secretary. </span>
<span sid='15283' title='15283'>'He would take the letter to an Embassy in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, as likely as not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15284' title='15284'>'I fancy not. </span>
<span sid='15285' title='15285'>These agents work independently, and their relations with the Embassies are often strained.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15286' title='15286'>The Prime Minister nodded his acquiescence.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15287' title='15287'>'I believe you are right, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='15288' title='15288'>He would take so valuable a prize to headquarters with his own hands. </span>
<span sid='15289' title='15289'>I think that your course of action is an excellent one. </span>
<span sid='15290' title='15290'>Meanwhile, Hope, we cannot neglect our other duties on account of this one misfortune. </span>
<span sid='15291' title='15291'>Should there be any fresh developments during the day we shall communicate with you, and you will no doubt let us know the results of your own inquiries.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15292' title='15292'>The two statesmen bowed and walked gravely from the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15293' title='15293'>When our illustrious visitors had departed, Holmes lit his pipe in silence, and sat for some time lost in the deepest thought. </span>
<span sid='15294' title='15294'>I had opened the morning paper and was immersed in a sensational crime which had occurred in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> the night before, when my friend gave an exclamation, sprang to his feet, and laid his pipe down upon the mantel-piece.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15295' title='15295'>'Yes,' said he, 'there is no better way of approaching it. </span>
<span sid='15296' title='15296'>The situation is desperate, but not hopeless. </span>
<span sid='15297' title='15297'>Even now, if we could be sure which of them has taken it, it is just possible that it has not yet passed out of his hands. </span>
<span sid='15298' title='15298'>After all, it is a question of money with these fellows, and I have the British Treasury behind me. </span>
<span sid='15299' title='15299'>If it's on the market I'll buy it - if it means another penny on the income tax. </span>
<span sid='15300' title='15300'>It is conceivable that the fellow might hold it back to see what bids come from this side before he tries his luck on the other. </span>
<span sid='15301' title='15301'>There are only those three capable of playing so bold a game; there are Oberstein, La Rothiere, and Eduardo Lucas. </span>
<span sid='15302' title='15302'>I will see each of them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15303' title='15303'>I glanced at my morning paper.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15304' title='15304'>'Is that Eduardo Lucas of Godolphin Street?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15305' title='15305'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15306' title='15306'>'You will not see him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15307' title='15307'>'Why not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15308' title='15308'>'He was murdered in his house last night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15309' title='15309'>My friend has so often astonished me in the course of our adventures that it was with a sense of exultation that I realized how completely I had astonished him. </span>
<span sid='15310' title='15310'>He stared in amazement, and then snatched the paper from my hands. </span>
<span sid='15311' title='15311'>This was the paragraph which I had been engaged in reading when he rose from his chair:</span>
<p>
<span sid='15312' title='15312'>MURDER IN WESTMINSTER</span>
<p>
<span sid='15313' title='15313'>A crime of a mysterious character was committed last night at 16, Godolphin Street, one of the old-fashioned and secluded rows of eighteenth-century houses which lie between the river and the Abbey, almost in the shadow of the great tower of the Houses of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Parliament&t=h'>Parliament</a>. </span>
<span sid='15314' title='15314'>This small but select mansion has been inhabited for some years by Mr Eduardo Lucas, well known in society circles both on account of his charming personality and because he has the well-deserved reputation of being one of the best amateur tenors in the country. </span>
<span sid='15315' title='15315'>Mr Lucas is an unmarried man, thirty-four years of age, and his establishment consists of Mrs Pringle, an elderly housekeeper, and of Mitton, his valet. </span>
<span sid='15316' title='15316'>The former retires early and sleeps at the top of the house. </span>
<span sid='15317' title='15317'>The valet was out for the evening, visiting a friend at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Hammersmith&t=h'>Hammersmith</a>. </span>
<span sid='15318' title='15318'>From ten o'clock onwards Mr Lucas had the house to himself. </span>
<span sid='15319' title='15319'>What occurred during that time has not yet transpired, but at a quarter to twelve Police-constable Barrett, passing along Godolphin Street, observed that the door of No. 16 was ajar. </span>
<span sid='15320' title='15320'>He knocked, but received no answer. </span>
<span sid='15321' title='15321'>Perceiving a light in the front room he advanced into the house and again knocked, but without reply. </span>
<span sid='15322' title='15322'>He then pushed open the door and entered. </span>
<span sid='15323' title='15323'>The room was in a state of wild disorder, the furniture being all swept to one side, and one chair lying on its back in the centre. </span>
<span sid='15324' title='15324'>Beside this chair, and still grasping one of its legs, lay the unfortunate tenant of the house. </span>
<span sid='15325' title='15325'>He had been stabbed to the heart, and must have died instantly. </span>
<span sid='15326' title='15326'>The knife with which the crime had been committed was a curved Indian dagger, plucked down from a trophy of Oriental arms which adorned one of the walls. </span>
<span sid='15327' title='15327'>Robbery does not appear to have been the motive of the crime, for there had been no attempt to remove the valuable contents of the room. </span>
<span sid='15328' title='15328'>Mr Eduardo Lucas was so well known and popular that his violent and mysterious fate will arouse painful interest and intense sympathy in a widespread circle of friends.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15329' title='15329'>'Well, Watson, what do you make of this?' asked Holmes, after a long pause.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15330' title='15330'>'It is an amazing coincidence.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15331' title='15331'>'A coincidence! </span>
<span sid='15332' title='15332'>Here is one of three men whom we had named as possible actors in this drama, and he meets a violent death during the very hours when we know that that drama was being enacted. </span>
<span sid='15333' title='15333'>The odds are enormous against its being coincidence. </span>
<span sid='15334' title='15334'>No figures could express them. </span>
<span sid='15335' title='15335'>No, my dear Watson, the two events are connected - must be connected. </span>
<span sid='15336' title='15336'>It is for us to find the connection.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15337' title='15337'>'But now the official police must know all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15338' title='15338'>'Not at all. </span>
<span sid='15339' title='15339'>They know all they see at Godolphin Street. </span>
<span sid='15340' title='15340'>They know - and shall know - nothing of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Whitehall&t=h'>Whitehall</a> Terrace. </span>
<span sid='15341' title='15341'>Only we know of both events, and can trace the relation between them. </span>
<span sid='15342' title='15342'>There is one obvious point which would, in any case, have turned my suspicions against Lucas. </span>
<span sid='15343' title='15343'>Godolphin Street, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Westminster&t=h'>Westminster</a>, is only a few minutes' walk from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Whitehall&t=h'>Whitehall</a> Terrace. </span>
<span sid='15344' title='15344'>The other secret agents whom I have named live in the extreme West End. </span>
<span sid='15345' title='15345'>It was easier, therefore, for Lucas than for the others to establish a connection or receive a message from the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>an Secretary's household - a small thing, and yet where events are compressed into a few hours it may prove essential. </span>
<span sid='15346' title='15346'>Hullo! what have we here?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15347' title='15347'>Mrs Hudson had appeared with a lady's card upon her salver. </span>
<span sid='15348' title='15348'>Holmes glanced at it, raised his eyebrows, and handed it over to me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15349' title='15349'>'Ask Lady Hilda Trelawney Hope if she will be kind enough to step up,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15350' title='15350'>A moment later our modest apartment, already so distinguished that morning, was further honoured by the entrance of the most lovely woman in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='15351' title='15351'>I had often heard of the beauty of the youngest daughter of the Duke of Belminster, but no description of it, and no contemplation of colourless photographs, had prepared me for the subtle, delicate charm and the beautiful colouring of that exquisite head. </span>
<span sid='15352' title='15352'>And yet as we saw it that autumn morning it was not its beauty which would be the first thing to impress the observer. </span>
<span sid='15353' title='15353'>The cheek was lovely, but it was paled with emotion; the eyes were bright, but it was the brightness of fever; the sensitive mouth was tight and drawn in an effort after self-command. </span>
<span sid='15354' title='15354'>Terror - not beauty - was what sprang first to the eye as our fair visitor stood framed for an instant in the open door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15355' title='15355'>'Has my husband been here, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15356' title='15356'>'Yes, madam, he has been here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15357' title='15357'>'Mr Holmes, I implore you not to tell him that I came here.' </span>
<span sid='15358' title='15358'>Holmes bowed coldly and motioned the lady to a chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15359' title='15359'>'Your ladyship places me in a very delicate position. </span>
<span sid='15360' title='15360'>I beg that you will sit down and tell me what you desire; but I fear that I cannot make any unconditional promise.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15361' title='15361'>She swept across the room and seated herself with her back to the window. </span>
<span sid='15362' title='15362'>It was a queenly presence - tall, graceful, and intensely womanly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15363' title='15363'>'Mr Holmes,' she said - and her white-gloved hands clasped and unclasped as she spoke - 'I will speak frankly to you in the hope that it may induce you to speak frankly in return. </span>
<span sid='15364' title='15364'>There is complete confidence between my husband and me on all matters save one. </span>
<span sid='15365' title='15365'>That one is politics. </span>
<span sid='15366' title='15366'>On this his lips are sealed. </span>
<span sid='15367' title='15367'>He tells me nothing. </span>
<span sid='15368' title='15368'>Now, I am aware that there was a most deplorable occurrence in our house last night. </span>
<span sid='15369' title='15369'>I know that a paper has disappeared. </span>
<span sid='15370' title='15370'>But because the matter is political my husband refuses to take me into his complete confidence. </span>
<span sid='15371' title='15371'>Now it is essential - essential, I say - that I should thoroughly understand it. </span>
<span sid='15372' title='15372'>You are the only other person, save these politicians, who knows the true facts. </span>
<span sid='15373' title='15373'>I beg you, then, Mr Holmes, to tell me exactly what has happened and what it will lead to. </span>
<span sid='15374' title='15374'>Tell me all, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='15375' title='15375'>Let no regard for your client's interests keep you silent, for I assure you that his interests, if he would only see it, would be best served by taking me into his complete confidence. </span>
<span sid='15376' title='15376'>What was this paper that was stolen?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15377' title='15377'>'Madam, what you ask me is really impossible.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15378' title='15378'>She groaned and sank her face in her hands.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15379' title='15379'>'You must see that this is so, madam. </span>
<span sid='15380' title='15380'>If your husband thinks fit to keep you in the dark over this matter, is it for me, who have only learned the true facts under the pledge of professional secrecy, to tell what he has withheld? </span>
<span sid='15381' title='15381'>It is not fair to ask it. </span>
<span sid='15382' title='15382'>It is him whom you must ask.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15383' title='15383'>'I have asked him. </span>
<span sid='15384' title='15384'>I come to you as a last resource. </span>
<span sid='15385' title='15385'>But without your telling me anything definite, Mr Holmes, you may do a great service if you would enlighten me on one point.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15386' title='15386'>'What is it, madam?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15387' title='15387'>'Is my husband's political career likely to suffer through this incident?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15388' title='15388'>'Well, madam, unless it is set right it may certainly have a very unfortunate effect.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15389' title='15389'>'Ah!' </span>
<span sid='15390' title='15390'>She drew in her breath sharply as one whose doubts are resolved.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15391' title='15391'>'One more question, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='15392' title='15392'>From an expression which my husband dropped in the first shock of this disaster I understood that terrible public consequences might arise from the loss of this document.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15393' title='15393'>'If he said so, I certainly cannot deny it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15394' title='15394'>'Of what nature are they?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15395' title='15395'>'Nay, madam, there again you ask me more than I can possibly answer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15396' title='15396'>'Then I will take up no more of your time. </span>
<span sid='15397' title='15397'>I cannot blame you, Mr Holmes, for having refused to speak more freely, and you on your side will not, I am sure, think the worse of me because I desire, even against his will, to share my husband's anxieties. </span>
<span sid='15398' title='15398'>Once more I beg that you will say nothing of my visit.' </span>
<span sid='15399' title='15399'>She looked back at us from the door, and I had a last impression of that beautiful, haunted face, the startled eyes, and the drawn mouth. </span>
<span sid='15400' title='15400'>Then she was gone.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15401' title='15401'>'Now, Watson, the fair sex is your department: said Holmes, with a smile, when the dwindling froufrou of skirts had ended in the slam of the door. </span>
<span sid='15402' title='15402'>'What was the fair lady's game? </span>
<span sid='15403' title='15403'>What did she really want?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15404' title='15404'>'Surely her own statement is clear and her anxiety very natural.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15405' title='15405'>'Hum! </span>
<span sid='15406' title='15406'>Think of her appearance, Watson, her manner, her suppressed excitement, her restlessness, her tenacity in asking questions. </span>
<span sid='15407' title='15407'>Remember that she comes of a caste who do not lightly show emotion.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15408' title='15408'>'She was certainly much moved.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15409' title='15409'>'Remember also the curious earnestness with which she assured us that it was best for her husband that she should know all. </span>
<span sid='15410' title='15410'>What did she mean by that? </span>
<span sid='15411' title='15411'>And you must have observed, Watson, how she manoeuvred to have the light at her back. </span>
<span sid='15412' title='15412'>She did not wish us to read her expression.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15413' title='15413'>'Yes; she chose the one chair in the room.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15414' title='15414'>'And yet the motives of women are so inscrutable. </span>
<span sid='15415' title='15415'>You remember the woman at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Margate&t=h'>Margate</a> whom I suspected for the same reason. </span>
<span sid='15416' title='15416'>No powder on her nose - that proved to be the correct solution. </span>
<span sid='15417' title='15417'>How can you build on such a quicksand? </span>
<span sid='15418' title='15418'>Their most trivial action may mean volumes, or their most extraordinary conduct may depend upon a hair-pin or a curling-tongs. </span>
<span sid='15419' title='15419'>Good morning, Watson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15420' title='15420'>'You are off?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15421' title='15421'>'Yes; I will while away the morning at Godolphin Street with our friends of the regular establishment. </span>
<span sid='15422' title='15422'>With Eduardo Lucas lies the solution of our problem, though I must admit that I have not an inkling as to what form it may take. </span>
<span sid='15423' title='15423'>It is a capital mistake to theorize in advance of the facts. </span>
<span sid='15424' title='15424'>Do you stay on guard, my good Watson, and receive any fresh visitors. </span>
<span sid='15425' title='15425'>I'll join you at lunch if I am able.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15426' title='15426'>All that day and the next and the next Holmes was in a mood which his friends would call taciturn, and others morose. </span>
<span sid='15427' title='15427'>He ran out and ran in, smoked incessantly, played snatches on his violin, sank into reveries, devoured sandwiches at irregular hours, and hardly answered the casual questions which I put to him. </span>
<span sid='15428' title='15428'>It was evident to me that things were not going well with him or his quest. </span>
<span sid='15429' title='15429'>He would say nothing of the case, and it was from the papers that I learned the particulars of the inquest and the arrest with the subsequent release of John Mitton, the valet of the deceased. </span>
<span sid='15430' title='15430'>The corner's jury brought in the obvious 'Wilful murder', but the parties remained as unknown as ever. </span>
<span sid='15431' title='15431'>No motive was suggested. </span>
<span sid='15432' title='15432'>The room was full of articles of value but none had been taken. </span>
<span sid='15433' title='15433'>The dead man's papers had not been tampered with. </span>
<span sid='15434' title='15434'>They were carefully examined, and showed that he was a keen student of international politics, an indefatigable gossip, a remarkable linguist, and an untiring letter-writer. </span>
<span sid='15435' title='15435'>He had been on intimate terms with the leading politicians of several countries. </span>
<span sid='15436' title='15436'>But nothing sensational was discovered among the documents which filled his drawers. </span>
<span sid='15437' title='15437'>As to his relations with women, they appeared to have been promiscuous but superficial. </span>
<span sid='15438' title='15438'>He had many acquaintances among them, but few friends, and no one whom he loved. </span>
<span sid='15439' title='15439'>His habits were regular, his conduct inoffensive. </span>
<span sid='15440' title='15440'>His death was an absolute mystery, and likely to remain so.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15441' title='15441'>As to the arrest of John Mitton, the valet, it was a counsel of despair as an alternative to absolute inaction. </span>
<span sid='15442' title='15442'>But no case could be sustained against him. </span>
<span sid='15443' title='15443'>He had visited friends in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Hammersmith&t=h'>Hammersmith</a> that night. </span>
<span sid='15444' title='15444'>The alibi was complete. </span>
<span sid='15445' title='15445'>It is true that he started home at an hour which should have brought him to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Westminster&t=h'>Westminster</a> before the time when the crime was discovered, but his own explanation that he had walked part of the way seemed probable enough in view of the fineness of the night. </span>
<span sid='15446' title='15446'>He had actually arrived at twelve o'clock, and appeared to be overwhelmed by the unexpected tragedy. </span>
<span sid='15447' title='15447'>He had always been on good terms with his master. </span>
<span sid='15448' title='15448'>Several of the dead man's possessions - notably a small case of razors - had been found in the valet's boxes, but he explained that they had been presents from the deceased, and the housekeeper was able to corroborate the story. </span>
<span sid='15449' title='15449'>Mitton had been in Lucas's employment for three years. </span>
<span sid='15450' title='15450'>It was noticeable that Lucas did not take Mitton on <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Continent&t=h'>the Continent</a> with him. </span>
<span sid='15451' title='15451'>Sometimes he visited <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Paris&t=h'>Paris</a> for three months on end, but Mitton was left in charge of the Godolphin Street house. </span>
<span sid='15452' title='15452'>As to the housekeeper, she had heard nothing on the night of the crime. </span>
<span sid='15453' title='15453'>If her master had a visitor, he had himself admitted him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15454' title='15454'>So for three mornings the mystery remained, so far as I could follow it in the papers. </span>
<span sid='15455' title='15455'>If Holmes knew more he kept his own counsel, but, as he told me that Inspector Lestrade had taken him into his confidence in the case, I knew that he was in close touch with every development. </span>
<span sid='15456' title='15456'>Upon the fourth day there appeared a long telegram from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Paris&t=h'>Paris</a> which seemed to solve the whole question:</span>
<p>
<span sid='15457' title='15457'>A discovery has just been made by the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Paris&t=h'>Paris</a>ian police [said the Daily Telegraph] which raises the veil which hung round the tragic fate of Mr Eduardo Lucas, who met his death by violence last Monday night at Godolphin Street, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Westminster&t=h'>Westminster</a>. </span>
<span sid='15458' title='15458'>Our readers will remember that the deceased gentleman was found stabbed in his room, and that some suspicion attached to his valet, but that the case broke down on an alibi. </span>
<span sid='15459' title='15459'>Yesterday a lady, who has been known as Mme Henri Fournaye, occupying a small villa in the Rue Austerlitz, was reported to the authorities by her servants as being insane. </span>
<span sid='15460' title='15460'>An examination showed that she had indeed developed mania of a dangerous and permanent form. </span>
<span sid='15461' title='15461'>On inquiry the police have discovered that Mme Henri Fournaye only returned from a journey to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> on Tuesday last, and there is evidence to connect her with the crime at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Westminster&t=h'>Westminster</a>. </span>
<span sid='15462' title='15462'>A comparison of photographs has proved conclusively that M. </span>
<span sid='15463' title='15463'>Henri Fournaye and Eduardo Lucas were really one and the same person, and that the deceased had for some reason lived a double life in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> and <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Paris&t=h'>Paris</a>. </span>
<span sid='15464' title='15464'>Mme Fournaye, who is of Creole origin, is of an extremely excitable nature, and has suffered in the past from attacks of jealousy which have amounted to frenzy. </span>
<span sid='15465' title='15465'>It is conjectured that it was in one of these that she committed the terrible crime which has caused such a sensation in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='15466' title='15466'>Her movements upon the Monday night have not yet been traced, but it is undoubted that a woman answering to her description attracted much attention at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Charing Cross&t=h'>Charing Cross</a> Station on Tuesday morning by the wildness of her appearance and the violence of her gestures. </span>
<span sid='15467' title='15467'>It is probable, therefore, that the crime was either committed when insane, or that its immediate effect was to drive the unhappy woman out of her mind. </span>
<span sid='15468' title='15468'>At present she is unable to give any coherent account of the past, and the doctors hold out no hopes of the re-establishment of her reason. </span>
<span sid='15469' title='15469'>There is evidence that a woman, who might have been Mme Fournaye, was seen for some hours on Monday night watching the house in Godolphin Street.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15470' title='15470'>'What do you think of that, Holmes?' </span>
<span sid='15471' title='15471'>I had read the account aloud to him, while he finished his breakfast.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15472' title='15472'>'My dear Watson,' said he, as he rose from the table and paced up and down the room, 'you are most long-suffering, but if I have told you nothing in the last three days it is because there is nothing to tell. </span>
<span sid='15473' title='15473'>Even now this report from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Paris&t=h'>Paris</a> does not help us much.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15474' title='15474'>'Surely it is final as regards the man's death.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15475' title='15475'>'The man's death is a mere incident - a trivial episode - in comparison with our real task, which is to trace this document and save a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>an catastrophe. </span>
<span sid='15476' title='15476'>Only one important thing has happened in the last three days, and that is that nothing has happened. </span>
<span sid='15477' title='15477'>I get reports almost hourly from the Government, and it is certain that nowhere in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a> is there any sign of trouble. </span>
<span sid='15478' title='15478'>Now, if this letter were loose - no, it can't be loose - but if it isn't loose, where can it be? </span>
<span sid='15479' title='15479'>Who has it? </span>
<span sid='15480' title='15480'>Why is it held back? </span>
<span sid='15481' title='15481'>That's the question that beats in my brain like a hammer. </span>
<span sid='15482' title='15482'>Was it, indeed, a coincidence that Lucas should meet his death on the night when the letter disappeared? </span>
<span sid='15483' title='15483'>Did the letter ever reach him? </span>
<span sid='15484' title='15484'>If so, why is it not among his papers? </span>
<span sid='15485' title='15485'>Did this mad wife of his carry it off with her? </span>
<span sid='15486' title='15486'>If so, is it in her house in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Paris&t=h'>Paris</a>? </span>
<span sid='15487' title='15487'>How could I search for it without the French police having their suspicions aroused? </span>
<span sid='15488' title='15488'>It is a case, my dear Watson, where the law is as dangerous to us as the criminals are. </span>
<span sid='15489' title='15489'>Every man's hand is against us, and yet the interests at stake are colossal. </span>
<span sid='15490' title='15490'>Should I bring it to a successful conclusion, it will certainly represent the crowning glory of my career. </span>
<span sid='15491' title='15491'>Ah, here is my latest from the front!' </span>
<span sid='15492' title='15492'>He glanced hurriedly at the note which had been handed in. </span>
<span sid='15493' title='15493'>'Hullo! </span>
<span sid='15494' title='15494'>Lestrade seems to have observed something of interest. </span>
<span sid='15495' title='15495'>Put on your hat, Watson, and we will stroll down together to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Westminster&t=h'>Westminster</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15496' title='15496'>It was my first visit to the scene of the crime - a high, dingy, narrow-chested house, prim, formal, and solid, like the century which gave it birth. </span>
<span sid='15497' title='15497'>Lestrade's bulldog features gazed out at us from the front window, and he greeted us warmly when a big constable had opened the door and let us in. </span>
<span sid='15498' title='15498'>The room into which we were shown was that in which the crime had been committed, but no trace of it now remained, save an ugly, irregular stain upon the carpet.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15499' title='15499'>This carpet was a small square drugget in the centre of the room, surrounded by a broad expanse of beautiful, old- fashioned, wood flooring in square blocks, highly polished. </span>
<span sid='15500' title='15500'>Over the fireplace was a magnificent trophy of weapons, one of which had been used on that tragic night. </span>
<span sid='15501' title='15501'>In the window was a sumptuous writing-desk, and every detail of the apartment, the pictures, the rugs, and the hangings, all pointed to a taste which was luxurious and the verge of effeminacy.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15502' title='15502'>'Seen the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Paris&t=h'>Paris</a> news?' asked Lestrade.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15503' title='15503'>Holmes nodded.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15504' title='15504'>'Our French friends seem to have touched the spot this time. </span>
<span sid='15505' title='15505'>No doubt it's just as they say. </span>
<span sid='15506' title='15506'>She knocked at the door - surprise visit, I guess, for he kept his life in watertight compartments. </span>
<span sid='15507' title='15507'>He let her in - couldn't keep her in the street. </span>
<span sid='15508' title='15508'>She told him how she had traced him, reproached him, one thing led to another, and then with that dagger so handy the end soon came. </span>
<span sid='15509' title='15509'>It wasn't all done in an instant, though, for these chairs were all swept over yonder, and he had one in his hand as if he had tried to hold her off with it. </span>
<span sid='15510' title='15510'>We've got it all as clear as if we had seen it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15511' title='15511'>Holmes raised his eyebrows.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15512' title='15512'>'And yet you have sent for me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15513' title='15513'>'Ash, yes, that's another matter - a mere trifle, but the sort of thing you take an interest in - queer, you know, and what you might call freakish. </span>
<span sid='15514' title='15514'>It has nothing to do with the main fact - can't have, on the face of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15515' title='15515'>'What is it, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15516' title='15516'>'Well, you know after a crime of this sort we are very careful to keep things in their position. </span>
<span sid='15517' title='15517'>Nothing has been moved. </span>
<span sid='15518' title='15518'>Officer in charge here day and night. </span>
<span sid='15519' title='15519'>This morning, as the man was buried and the investigation over - so far as this room is concerned - we thought we could tidy up a bit. </span>
<span sid='15520' title='15520'>This carpet. </span>
<span sid='15521' title='15521'>You see, it is not fastened down; only just laid there. </span>
<span sid='15522' title='15522'>We had occasion to raise it. </span>
<span sid='15523' title='15523'>We found-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15524' title='15524'>'"Yes? </span>
<span sid='15525' title='15525'>You found-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15526' title='15526'>Holmes's face grew tense with anxiety.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15527' title='15527'>'Well, I'm sure you would never guess in a hundred years what we did find. </span>
<span sid='15528' title='15528'>You see that stain on the carpet? </span>
<span sid='15529' title='15529'>Well, a great deal must have soaked through, must it not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15530' title='15530'>'Undoubtedly it must.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15531' title='15531'>'Well, you will be surprised to hear that there is no stain on the white woodwork to correspond.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15532' title='15532'>'No stain! </span>
<span sid='15533' title='15533'>But there must-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15534' title='15534'>'Yes; so you would say. </span>
<span sid='15535' title='15535'>But the fact remains that there isn't.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15536' title='15536'>He took the corner of the carpet in his hand and, turning it over, he showed that it was indeed as he said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15537' title='15537'>'But the underside is as stained as the upper. </span>
<span sid='15538' title='15538'>It must have left a mark.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15539' title='15539'>Lestrade chuckled with delight at having puzzled the famous expert.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15540' title='15540'>'Now I'll show you the explanation. </span>
<span sid='15541' title='15541'>There is a second stain, but it does not correspond with the other. </span>
<span sid='15542' title='15542'>See for yourself.' </span>
<span sid='15543' title='15543'>As he spoke he turned over another portion of the carpet, and there, sure enough, was a great crimson spill upon the square white facing of the old-fashioned floor. </span>
<span sid='15544' title='15544'>'What do you make of that, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15545' title='15545'>'Why, it is simple enough. </span>
<span sid='15546' title='15546'>The two stains did correspond, but the carpet has been turned round. </span>
<span sid='15547' title='15547'>As it was square and unfastened, it was easily done.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15548' title='15548'>The official police don't need you, Mr Holmes, to tell them that the carpet must have been turned round. </span>
<span sid='15549' title='15549'>That's clear enough, for the stains lie above each other - if you lay it over this way. </span>
<span sid='15550' title='15550'>But what I want to know is, who shifted the carpet, and why?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15551' title='15551'>I could see from Holmes's rigid face that he was vibrating with inward excitement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15552' title='15552'>'Look here, Lestrade!' said he. </span>
<span sid='15553' title='15553'>'Has that constable in the passage been in charge of the place all the time?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15554' title='15554'>'Yes, he has.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15555' title='15555'>'Well, take my advice. </span>
<span sid='15556' title='15556'>Examine him carefully. </span>
<span sid='15557' title='15557'>Don't do it before us. </span>
<span sid='15558' title='15558'>We'll wait here. </span>
<span sid='15559' title='15559'>You take him into the back room. </span>
<span sid='15560' title='15560'>You'll be more likely to get a confession out of him alone. </span>
<span sid='15561' title='15561'>Ask him how he dared to admit people and leave them alone in this room. </span>
<span sid='15562' title='15562'>Don't ask him if he has done it. </span>
<span sid='15563' title='15563'>Take it for granted. </span>
<span sid='15564' title='15564'>Tell him you know someone has been here. </span>
<span sid='15565' title='15565'>Press him. </span>
<span sid='15566' title='15566'>Tell him that a full confession is his only chance for forgiveness. </span>
<span sid='15567' title='15567'>Do exactly what I tell you!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15568' title='15568'>'By George, if he knows I'll have it out of him!' cried Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='15569' title='15569'>He darted into the hall, and a few moments later his bullying voice sounded from the back room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15570' title='15570'>'Now, Watson, now!' cried Holmes, with frenzied eagerness. </span>
<span sid='15571' title='15571'>All the demoniacal force of the man masked behind that listless manner burst out in a paroxysm of energy. </span>
<span sid='15572' title='15572'>He tore the drugget from the floor, and in an instant was down on his hands and knees clawing at each of the squares of wood beneath it. </span>
<span sid='15573' title='15573'>One turned sideways as he dug his nails into the edge of it. </span>
<span sid='15574' title='15574'>It hinged back like the lid of a box. </span>
<span sid='15575' title='15575'>A small black cavity opened beneath it. </span>
<span sid='15576' title='15576'>Holmes plunged his eager hand into it, and drew it out with a bitter snarl of anger and disappointment. </span>
<span sid='15577' title='15577'>It was empty.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15578' title='15578'>'Quick, Watson, quick! </span>
<span sid='15579' title='15579'>Get it back again!' </span>
<span sid='15580' title='15580'>The wooden lid was replaced, and the drugget had only just been drawn straight, when Lestrade's voice was heard in the passage. </span>
<span sid='15581' title='15581'>He found Holmes leaning languidly against the mantelpiece, resigned and patient, endeavouring to conceal his irrepressible yawns.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15582' title='15582'>'Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr Holmes, I can see that you are bored to death with the whole affair. </span>
<span sid='15583' title='15583'>Well, he has confessed all right. </span>
<span sid='15584' title='15584'>Come in here, MacPherson. </span>
<span sid='15585' title='15585'>Let these gentlemen hear of your most inexcusable conduct.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15586' title='15586'>The big constable, very hot and penitent, sidled into the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15587' title='15587'>'I meant no harm, sir, I'm sure. </span>
<span sid='15588' title='15588'>The young woman came to the door last evening - mistook the house, she did. </span>
<span sid='15589' title='15589'>And then we got talking. </span>
<span sid='15590' title='15590'>It's lonesome, when you're on duty here all day.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15591' title='15591'>'Well, what happened then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15592' title='15592'>'She wanted to see where the crime was done - had read about it in the papers, she said. </span>
<span sid='15593' title='15593'>She was a very respectable, well-spoken young woman, sir, and I saw no harm in letting her have a peep. </span>
<span sid='15594' title='15594'>When she saw that mark on the carpet, down she dropped on the floor, and lay as if she were dead. </span>
<span sid='15595' title='15595'>I ran back and got some water, but I could not bring her to. </span>
<span sid='15596' title='15596'>Then I went round the corner to the Ivy Plant for some brandy, and by the time I had brought it back the young woman had recovered and was off - ashamed of herself, I dare say, and dared not face me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15597' title='15597'>'How about moving that drugget?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15598' title='15598'>'Well, sir, it was a bit rumpled, certainly when I came back. </span>
<span sid='15599' title='15599'>You see, she fell on it, and it lies on a polished floor with nothing to keep it in place. </span>
<span sid='15600' title='15600'>I straightened it out afterwards.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15601' title='15601'>'It's a lesson to you that you can't deceive me, Constable MacPherson,' said Lestrade, with dignity. </span>
<span sid='15602' title='15602'>'No doubt you thought that your breach of duty could never be discovered, and yet a mere glance at that drugget was enough to convince me that someone had been admitted to the room. </span>
<span sid='15603' title='15603'>It's lucky for you, my man, that nothing is missing, or you would find yourself in Queer Street. </span>
<span sid='15604' title='15604'>I'm sorry to have to call you down over such a petty business, Mr Holmes, but I thought the point of the second stain not corresponding with the first would interest you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15605' title='15605'>'Certainly it was most interesting. </span>
<span sid='15606' title='15606'>Has this woman only been here once, constable?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15607' title='15607'>'Yes, sir, only once.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15608' title='15608'>'Who was she?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15609' title='15609'>'Don't know the name, sir. </span>
<span sid='15610' title='15610'>Was answering an advertisement about typewriting, and came to the wrong number very pleasant, genteel young woman, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15611' title='15611'>'Tall? </span>
<span sid='15612' title='15612'>Handsome?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15613' title='15613'>'Yes, sir; she was a well-grown young woman. </span>
<span sid='15614' title='15614'>I suppose you might say she was handsome. </span>
<span sid='15615' title='15615'>Perhaps some would say she was very handsome. </span>
<span sid='15616' title='15616'>"Oh, officer, do let me have a peep!" says she. </span>
<span sid='15617' title='15617'>She had pretty, coaxing ways, as you might say, and I thought there was no harm in letting her just put her head through the door.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15618' title='15618'>'How was she dressed?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15619' title='15619'>'Quiet, sir - a long mantle down to her feet.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15620' title='15620'>'What time was it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15621' title='15621'>'It was just growing dusk at the time. </span>
<span sid='15622' title='15622'>They were fighting the lamps as I came back with the brandy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15623' title='15623'>'Very good,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='15624' title='15624'>'Come, Watson, I think that we have more important work elsewhere.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15625' title='15625'>As we left the house Lestrade remained in the front room, while the repentant constable opened the door to let us out. </span>
<span sid='15626' title='15626'>Holmes turned on the step and held up something in his hand. </span>
<span sid='15627' title='15627'>The constable stared intently.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15628' title='15628'>'Good Lord, sir!' he cried, with amazement on his face. </span>
<span sid='15629' title='15629'>Holmes put his finger on his lips, replaced his hand in his breast-pocket, and burst out laughing as we turned down the street. </span>
<span sid='15630' title='15630'>'Excellent!' said he. </span>
<span sid='15631' title='15631'>'Come, friend Watson, the curtain rings up for the last act. </span>
<span sid='15632' title='15632'>You will be relieved to hear that there will be no war, that the Right Honourable Trelawney Hope will suffer no set-back in his brilliant career, that the indiscreet Sovereign will receive no punishment for his indiscretion, that the Prime Minister will have no <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>an complication to deal with, and that with a little tact and management upon our part nobody will be a penny the worse for what might have been a very ugly accident.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15633' title='15633'>My mind filled with admiration for this extraordinary man.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15634' title='15634'>'You have solved it!' I cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15635' title='15635'>'Hardly that, Watson. </span>
<span sid='15636' title='15636'>There are some points which are as dark as ever. </span>
<span sid='15637' title='15637'>But we have so much that it will be our own fault if we cannot get the rest. </span>
<span sid='15638' title='15638'>We will go straight to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Whitehall&t=h'>Whitehall</a> Terrace and bring the matter to a head.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15639' title='15639'>When we arrived at the residence of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>an Secretary it was for Lady Hilda Trelawney Hope that Sherlock Holmes inquired. </span>
<span sid='15640' title='15640'>We were shown into the morning-room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15641' title='15641'>'Mr Holmes!' said the lady, and her face was pink with indignation, 'this is surely most unfair and ungenerous upon your part. </span>
<span sid='15642' title='15642'>I desired, as I have explained, to keep my visit to you a secret, lest my husband should think that I was intruding into his affairs. </span>
<span sid='15643' title='15643'>And yet you compromise me by coming here, and so showing that there are business relations between us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15644' title='15644'>'Unfortunately, madam, I had no possible alternative. </span>
<span sid='15645' title='15645'>I have been commissioned to recover this immensely important paper. </span>
<span sid='15646' title='15646'>I must therefore ask you, madam, to be kind enough to place it in my hands.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15647' title='15647'>The lady sprang to her feet, with the colour all dashed in an instant from her beautiful face. </span>
<span sid='15648' title='15648'>Her eyes glazed - she tottered	I thought that she would faint. </span>
<span sid='15649' title='15649'>Then with a grand effort she rallied from the shock, and a supreme astonishment and indignation chased every other expression from her features.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15650' title='15650'>'You - you insult me, Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15651' title='15651'>'Come, come, madam, it is useless. </span>
<span sid='15652' title='15652'>Give up the letter.' </span>
<span sid='15653' title='15653'>She darted to the bell.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15654' title='15654'>'The butler shall show you out.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15655' title='15655'>'Do not ring, Lady Hilda. </span>
<span sid='15656' title='15656'>If you do, then all my earnest efforts to avoid a scandal will be frustrated. </span>
<span sid='15657' title='15657'>Give up the letter, and all will be set right. </span>
<span sid='15658' title='15658'>If you will work with me, I can arrange everything. </span>
<span sid='15659' title='15659'>If you work against me, I must expose you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15660' title='15660'>She stood grandly defiant, a queenly figure, her eyes fixed upon his as if she would read his very soul. </span>
<span sid='15661' title='15661'>Her hand was on the bell, but she had forborne to ring it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15662' title='15662'>'You are trying to frighten me. </span>
<span sid='15663' title='15663'>It is not a very manly thing, Mr Holmes, to come here and browbeat a woman. </span>
<span sid='15664' title='15664'>You say that you know something. </span>
<span sid='15665' title='15665'>What is it that you know?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15666' title='15666'>'Pray sit down, madam. </span>
<span sid='15667' title='15667'>You will hurt yourself there if you fall. </span>
<span sid='15668' title='15668'>I will not speak until you sit down. </span>
<span sid='15669' title='15669'>Thank you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15670' title='15670'>'I give you five minutes, Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15671' title='15671'>'One is enough, Lady Hilda. </span>
<span sid='15672' title='15672'>I know of your visit to Eduardo Lucas, and of your giving him this document, of your ingenious return to the room last night, and of the manner in which you took the letter from the hiding-place under the carpet.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15673' title='15673'>She stared at him with an ashen face, and gulped twice before she could speak.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15674' title='15674'>'You are mad, Mr Holmes - you are mad!' she cried at last.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15675' title='15675'>He drew a small piece of cardboard from his pocket. </span>
<span sid='15676' title='15676'>It was the face of a woman cut out of a portrait.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15677' title='15677'>'I have carried this because I thought it might be useful,' said he. </span>
<span sid='15678' title='15678'>'The policeman has recognized it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15679' title='15679'>She gave a gasp, and her head dropped back in her chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15680' title='15680'>'Come, Lady Hilda. </span>
<span sid='15681' title='15681'>You have the letter. </span>
<span sid='15682' title='15682'>The matter may still be adjusted. </span>
<span sid='15683' title='15683'>I have no desire to bring trouble to you. </span>
<span sid='15684' title='15684'>My duty ends when I have returned the lost letter to your husband. </span>
<span sid='15685' title='15685'>Take my advice, and be frank with me; it is your only chance.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15686' title='15686'>Her courage was admirable. </span>
<span sid='15687' title='15687'>Even now she would not own defeat.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15688' title='15688'>'I tell you again, Mr Holmes, that you are under some absurd illusion.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15689' title='15689'>Holmes rose from his chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15690' title='15690'>'I am sorry for you, Lady Hilda. </span>
<span sid='15691' title='15691'>I have done my best for you; I can see that it is all in vain.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15692' title='15692'>He rang the bell. </span>
<span sid='15693' title='15693'>The butler entered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15694' title='15694'>'Is Mr Trelawney Hope at home?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15695' title='15695'>'He will be home, sir, at a quarter to one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15696' title='15696'>Holmes glanced at his watch.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15697' title='15697'>'Still a quarter of an hour,' said he. </span>
<span sid='15698' title='15698'>'Very good, I shall wait.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15699' title='15699'>The butler had hardly closed the door behind him when Lady Hilda was down on her knees at Holmes's feet, her hands outstretched, her beautiful face upturned and wet with her tears.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15700' title='15700'>'Oh, spare me, Mr Holmes! </span>
<span sid='15701' title='15701'>Spare me!' she pleaded, in a frenzy of supplication. </span>
<span sid='15702' title='15702'>'For God's sake don't tell him! </span>
<span sid='15703' title='15703'>I love him so! </span>
<span sid='15704' title='15704'>I would not bring one shadow on his life, and this I know would break his noble heart.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15705' title='15705'>Holmes raised the lady. </span>
<span sid='15706' title='15706'>'I thank God, madam, that you have come to your senses even at this last moment! </span>
<span sid='15707' title='15707'>There is not an instant to lose. </span>
<span sid='15708' title='15708'>Where is the letter?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15709' title='15709'>She darted across to a writing-desk, unlocked it, and drew out a long blue envelope.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15710' title='15710'>'Here it is, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='15711' title='15711'>Would to Heaven I had never seen it!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15712' title='15712'>'How can we return it?' Holmes muttered. </span>
<span sid='15713' title='15713'>'Quick, quick, we must think of some way! </span>
<span sid='15714' title='15714'>Where is the dispatch-box?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15715' title='15715'>'Still in his bedroom.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15716' title='15716'>'What a stroke of luck! </span>
<span sid='15717' title='15717'>Quick, madam, bring it here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15718' title='15718'>A moment later she had appeared with a red flat box in her hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15719' title='15719'>'How did you open it before? </span>
<span sid='15720' title='15720'>You have a duplicate key? </span>
<span sid='15721' title='15721'>Yes, of course you have. </span>
<span sid='15722' title='15722'>Open it!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15723' title='15723'>From out of her bosom Lady Hilda had drawn a small key. </span>
<span sid='15724' title='15724'>The box flew open. </span>
<span sid='15725' title='15725'>It was stuffed with papers. </span>
<span sid='15726' title='15726'>Holmes thrust the blue envelope deep down into the heart of them, between the leaves of some other document. </span>
<span sid='15727' title='15727'>The box was shut, locked, and returned to his bedroom.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15728' title='15728'>'Now we are ready for him,' said Holmes; 'we have still ten minutes. </span>
<span sid='15729' title='15729'>I am going far to screen you, Lady Hilda. </span>
<span sid='15730' title='15730'>In return you will spend the time in telling me frankly the real meaning of this extraordinary affair.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15731' title='15731'>'Mr Holmes, I will tell you everything,' cried the lady. </span>
<span sid='15732' title='15732'>'Oh, Mr Holmes, I would cut off my right hand before I gave him a moment of sorrow! </span>
<span sid='15733' title='15733'>There is no woman in all <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> who loves her husband as I do, and yet if he knew how I have acted - how I have been compelled to act - he would never forgive me. </span>
<span sid='15734' title='15734'>For his own honour stands so high that he could not forget or pardon a lapse in another. </span>
<span sid='15735' title='15735'>Help me, Mr Holmes! </span>
<span sid='15736' title='15736'>My happiness, his happiness, our very lives are at stake!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15737' title='15737'>'Quick, madam, the time grows short!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15738' title='15738'>'It was a letter of mine, Mr Holmes, an indiscreet letter written before my marriage - a foolish letter, a letter of an impulsive, loving girl. </span>
<span sid='15739' title='15739'>I meant no harm, and yet he would have thought it criminal. </span>
<span sid='15740' title='15740'>Had he read that letter his confidence would have been for ever destroyed. </span>
<span sid='15741' title='15741'>It is years since I wrote it. </span>
<span sid='15742' title='15742'>I had thought that the whole matter was forgotten. </span>
<span sid='15743' title='15743'>Then at last I heard from this man, Lucas, that it had passed into his hands, and that he would lay it before my husband. </span>
<span sid='15744' title='15744'>I implored his mercy. </span>
<span sid='15745' title='15745'>He said that he would return my letter if I would return him a certain document which he described in my husband's dispatch-box. </span>
<span sid='15746' title='15746'>He had some spy in the office who had told him of its existence. </span>
<span sid='15747' title='15747'>He assured me that no harm could come to my husband. </span>
<span sid='15748' title='15748'>Put yourself in my position, Mr Holmes! </span>
<span sid='15749' title='15749'>What was I to do?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15750' title='15750'>'Take your husband into your confidence.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15751' title='15751'>'I could not, Mr Holmes, I could not! </span>
<span sid='15752' title='15752'>On the one side seemed certain ruin; on the other, terrible as it seemed to take my husband's papers, still in a matter of politics I could not understand the consequences, while in a matter of love and trust they were only too clear to me. </span>
<span sid='15753' title='15753'>I did it, Mr Holmes! </span>
<span sid='15754' title='15754'>I took an impression of his key; this man Lucas furnished a duplicate. </span>
<span sid='15755' title='15755'>I opened his dispatch-box, took the paper, and coveyed it to Godolphin Street.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15756' title='15756'>'What happened there, madam?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15757' title='15757'>'I tapped at the door, as agreed. </span>
<span sid='15758' title='15758'>Lucas opened it. </span>
<span sid='15759' title='15759'>I followed him into his room, leaving the hall door ajar behind me, for I feared to be alone with the man. </span>
<span sid='15760' title='15760'>I remember that there was a woman outside as I entered. </span>
<span sid='15761' title='15761'>Our business was soon done. </span>
<span sid='15762' title='15762'>He had my letter on his desk; I handed him the document. </span>
<span sid='15763' title='15763'>He gave me the letter. </span>
<span sid='15764' title='15764'>At this instant there was a sound at the door. </span>
<span sid='15765' title='15765'>There were steps in the passage. </span>
<span sid='15766' title='15766'>Lucas quickly turned back the drugget, thrust the document into some hiding-place there, and covered it over.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15767' title='15767'>'What happened after that is like some fearful dream. </span>
<span sid='15768' title='15768'>I have a vision of a dark, frantic face, of a woman's voice, which screamed in French, "My waiting is not in vain. </span>
<span sid='15769' title='15769'>At last, at last I have found you with her!" </span>
<span sid='15770' title='15770'>There was a savage struggle. </span>
<span sid='15771' title='15771'>I saw him with a chair in his hand, a knife gleamed in hers. </span>
<span sid='15772' title='15772'>I rushed from the horrible scene, ran from the house and only next morning in the paper did I learn the dreadful result. </span>
<span sid='15773' title='15773'>That night I was happy, for I had my letter, and I had not seen yet what the future would bring.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15774' title='15774'>'It was next morning that I realized that I had only exchanged one trouble for another. </span>
<span sid='15775' title='15775'>My husband's anguish at the loss of his paper went to my heart. </span>
<span sid='15776' title='15776'>I could hardly prevent myself from there and then kneeling down at his feet and telling him what I had done. </span>
<span sid='15777' title='15777'>But that again would mean a confession of the past. </span>
<span sid='15778' title='15778'>I came to you that morning in order to understand the full enormity of my offence. </span>
<span sid='15779' title='15779'>From the instant that I grasped it my whole mind turned to the one thought of getting back my husband's paper. </span>
<span sid='15780' title='15780'>It must still be where Lucas had placed it, for it was concealed before this dreadful woman entered the room. </span>
<span sid='15781' title='15781'>If it had not been for her coming, I should not have known where his hiding-place was. </span>
<span sid='15782' title='15782'>How was I to get into the room? </span>
<span sid='15783' title='15783'>For two days I watched the place, but the door was never left open. </span>
<span sid='15784' title='15784'>Last night I made a last attempt. </span>
<span sid='15785' title='15785'>What I did and how I succeeded, you have already learned. </span>
<span sid='15786' title='15786'>I brought the paper back with me, and thought of destroying it, since I could see no way of returning it without confessing my guilt to my husband. </span>
<span sid='15787' title='15787'>Good God, I hear his step upon the stair!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15788' title='15788'>The <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>an Secretary burst excitedly into the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15789' title='15789'>'Any news, Mr Holmes, any news?' he cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15790' title='15790'>'I have some hopes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15791' title='15791'>'Ah, thank God!' </span>
<span sid='15792' title='15792'>His face became radiant. </span>
<span sid='15793' title='15793'>'The Prime Minister is lunching with me. </span>
<span sid='15794' title='15794'>May he share your hopes? </span>
<span sid='15795' title='15795'>He has nerves of steel, and yet I know that he has hardly slept since this terrible event. </span>
<span sid='15796' title='15796'>Jacobs, will you ask the Prime Minister to come up? </span>
<span sid='15797' title='15797'>As to you, dear, I fear that this is a matter of politics. </span>
<span sid='15798' title='15798'>We will join you in a few minutes in the dining-room.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15799' title='15799'>The Prime Minister's manner was subdued, but I could see by the gleam of his eyes and the twitchings of his bony hands that he shared the excitement of his young colleague.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15800' title='15800'>'I understand that you have something to report, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15801' title='15801'>'Purely negative as yet,' my friend answered. </span>
<span sid='15802' title='15802'>'I have inquired at every point where it might be, and I am sure that there is no danger to be apprehended.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15803' title='15803'>'But that is not enough, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='15804' title='15804'>We cannot lie for ever on such a volcano. </span>
<span sid='15805' title='15805'>We must have something definite.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15806' title='15806'>'I am in hopes of getting it. </span>
<span sid='15807' title='15807'>That is why I am here. </span>
<span sid='15808' title='15808'>The more I think of the matter the more convinced I am that the letter has never left this house.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15809' title='15809'>'Mr Holmes!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15810' title='15810'>'If it had it would certainly have been public by now.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15811' title='15811'>'But why should anyone take it in order to keep it in this house?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15812' title='15812'>'I am not convinced that anyone did take it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15813' title='15813'>'Then how could it leave the dispatch-box?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15814' title='15814'>'I am not convinced that it ever did leave the dispatch-box.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15815' title='15815'>'Mr Holmes, this joking is very ill-timed. </span>
<span sid='15816' title='15816'>You have my assurance that it left the box.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15817' title='15817'>'Have you examined the box since Tuesday morning?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15818' title='15818'>'No; it was not necessary.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15819' title='15819'>'You may conceivably have overlooked it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15820' title='15820'>'Impossible, I say.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15821' title='15821'>'But I am not convinced of it; I have known such things happen. </span>
<span sid='15822' title='15822'>I presume there are other papers there. </span>
<span sid='15823' title='15823'>Well, it may have got mixed with them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15824' title='15824'>'It was on the top.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15825' title='15825'>'Someone may have shaken the box and displaced it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15826' title='15826'>'No, no; I had everything out.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15827' title='15827'>'Surely it is easily decided, Hope!' said the Premier. </span>
<span sid='15828' title='15828'>'Let us have the dispatch-box brought in.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15829' title='15829'>The Secretary rang the bell.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15830' title='15830'>'Jacobs, bring down my dispatch-box. </span>
<span sid='15831' title='15831'>This is a farcical waste of time, but still, if nothing else will satisfy you, it shall be done. </span>
<span sid='15832' title='15832'>Thank you, Jacobs; put it here. </span>
<span sid='15833' title='15833'>I have always had the key on my watch-chain. </span>
<span sid='15834' title='15834'>Here are the papers, you see. </span>
<span sid='15835' title='15835'>Letter from Lord Merrow, report from Sir Charles Hardy, memorandum from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Belgrade&t=h'>Belgrade</a>, note on the Russo-German grain taxes, letter from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Madrid&t=h'>Madrid</a>, note from Lord Flowers - good God! what is this? </span>
<span sid='15836' title='15836'>Lord Bellinger! </span>
<span sid='15837' title='15837'>Lord Bellinger!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15838' title='15838'>The Premier snatched the blue envelope from his hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15839' title='15839'>'Yes, it is it - and the letter intact. </span>
<span sid='15840' title='15840'>Hope, I congratulate you!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15841' title='15841'>'Thank you! </span>
<span sid='15842' title='15842'>Thank you! </span>
<span sid='15843' title='15843'>What a weight from my heart! </span>
<span sid='15844' title='15844'>But this is inconceivable - impossible! </span>
<span sid='15845' title='15845'>Mr Holmes, you are a wizard, a sorcerer! </span>
<span sid='15846' title='15846'>How did you know it was there?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15847' title='15847'>'Because I knew it was nowhere else.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15848' title='15848'>'I cannot believe my eyes!' </span>
<span sid='15849' title='15849'>He ran wildly to the door. </span>
<span sid='15850' title='15850'>'Where is my wife! </span>
<span sid='15851' title='15851'>I must tell her that all is well. </span>
<span sid='15852' title='15852'>Hilda! </span>
<span sid='15853' title='15853'>Hilda!' we heard his voice on the stairs.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15854' title='15854'>The Premier looked at Holmes with twinkling eyes. </span>
<span sid='15855' title='15855'>'Come, sir,' said he. </span>
<span sid='15856' title='15856'>'There is more in this than meets the eye. </span>
<span sid='15857' title='15857'>How came the letter back in the box?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15858' title='15858'>Holmes turned away smiling from the keen scrutiny of those wonderful eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15859' title='15859'>'We also have our diplomatic secrets,' said he, and picking up his hat he turned to the door.</span>
