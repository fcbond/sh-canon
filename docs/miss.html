<p>
<span sid='19592' title='19592'>We were fairly accustomed to receive weird telegrams at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>, but I have a particular recollection of one which reached us on a gloomy February morning some seven or eight years ago, and gave Mr. Sherlock Holmes a puzzled quarter of an hour. </span>
<span sid='19593' title='19593'>It was addressed to him, and ran thus:</span>
<p>
<span sid='19594' title='19594'>Please await me. </span>
<span sid='19595' title='19595'>Terrible misfortune. </span>
<span sid='19596' title='19596'>Right wing three-quarter missing. </span>
<span sid='19597' title='19597'>Indispensable to-morrow. </span>
<span sid='19598' title='19598'>OVERTON</span>
<p>
<span sid='19599' title='19599'>'Strand postmark, and despatched ten thirty-six,' said Holmes, reading it over and over. </span>
<span sid='19600' title='19600'>'Mr. Overton was evidently considerably excited when he sent it, and somewhat incoherent in consequence. </span>
<span sid='19601' title='19601'>Well, well, he will be here, I dare say, by the time I have looked through The Times, and then we shall know all about it. </span>
<span sid='19602' title='19602'>Even the most insignificant problem would be welcome in these stagnant days.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19603' title='19603'>Things had indeed been very slow with us, and I had learned to dread such periods of inaction, for I knew by experience that my companion's brain was so abnormally active that it was dangerous to leave it without material upon which to work. </span>
<span sid='19604' title='19604'>For years I had gradually weaned him from that drug mania which had threatened once to check his remarkable career. </span>
<span sid='19605' title='19605'>Now I knew that under ordinary conditions he no longer craved for this artificial stimulus; but I was well aware that the fiend was not dead, but sleeping; and I have known that the sleep was a light one and the waking near when in periods of idleness I have seen the drawn look upon Holmes's ascetic face, and the brooding of his deep-set and inscrutable eyes. </span>
<span sid='19606' title='19606'>Therefore I blessed this Mr. Overton, whoever he might be, since he had come with his enigmatic message to break that dangerous calm which brought more peril to my friend than all the storms of his tempestuous life.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19607' title='19607'>As we expected, the telegram was soon followed by its sender, and the card of Mr. Cyril Overton, of Trinity College, Cambridge, announced the arrival of an enormous young man, sixteen stone of solid bone and muscle, who spanned the doorway with his broad shoulders and looked from one of us to the other with a comely face which was haggard with anxiety.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19608' title='19608'>'Mr. Sherlock Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19609' title='19609'>My companion bowed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19610' title='19610'>'I've been down to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>, Mr. Holmes. </span>
<span sid='19611' title='19611'>I saw Inspector Stanley Hopkins. </span>
<span sid='19612' title='19612'>He advised me to come to you. </span>
<span sid='19613' title='19613'>He said the case, so far as he could see, was more in your line than in that of the regular police.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19614' title='19614'>'Pray sit down and tell me what is the matter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19615' title='19615'>'It's awful, Mr. Holmes, simply awful! </span>
<span sid='19616' title='19616'>I wonder my hair isn't grey. </span>
<span sid='19617' title='19617'>Godfrey Staunton - you've heard of him, of course? </span>
<span sid='19618' title='19618'>He's simply the hinge that the whole team turns on. </span>
<span sid='19619' title='19619'>I'd rather spare two from the pack and have Godfrey for my three-quarter line. </span>
<span sid='19620' title='19620'>Whether it's passing, or tackling, or dribbling, there's no one to touch him; and then, he's got the head and can hold us all together. </span>
<span sid='19621' title='19621'>What am I to do? </span>
<span sid='19622' title='19622'>That's what I ask you, Mr. Holmes. </span>
<span sid='19623' title='19623'>There's Moorhouse, first reserve, but he is trained as a half, and he always edges right in on to the scrum instead of keeping out on the touch-line. </span>
<span sid='19624' title='19624'>He's a fine place-kick, it's true, but, then, he has no judgment, and he can't sprint for nuts. </span>
<span sid='19625' title='19625'>Why, Morton or Johnson, the Oxford fliers, could romp round him. </span>
<span sid='19626' title='19626'>Stevenson is fast enough, but he couldn't drop from the twenty-five line, and a three-quarter who can't either punt or drop isn't worth a place for pace alone. </span>
<span sid='19627' title='19627'>No, Mr. Holmes, we are done unless you can help me to find Godfrey Staunton.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19628' title='19628'>My friend had listened with amused surprise to this long speech, which was poured forth with extraordinary vigour and earnestness, every point being driven home by the slapping of a brawny hand upon the speaker's knee. </span>
<span sid='19629' title='19629'>When our visitor was silent Holmes stretched out his hand and took down letter 'S' of his commonplace book. </span>
<span sid='19630' title='19630'>For once he dug in vain into that mine of varied information.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19631' title='19631'>'There is Arthur H. Staunton, the rising young forger,' said he, 'and there was Henry Staunton, whom I helped to hang, but Godfrey Staunton is a new name to me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19632' title='19632'>It was our visitor's turn to look surprised.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19633' title='19633'>'Why, Mr. Holmes, I thought you knew things,' said he. </span>
<span sid='19634' title='19634'>'I suppose, then, if you have never heard of Godfrey Staunton you don't know Cyril Overton either?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19635' title='19635'>Holmes shook his head good-humouredly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19636' title='19636'>'Great Scott!' cried the athlete. </span>
<span sid='19637' title='19637'>'Why, I was first reserve for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> against <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Wales&t=h'>Wales</a>, and I've skippered the 'Varsity all this year. </span>
<span sid='19638' title='19638'>But that's nothing. </span>
<span sid='19639' title='19639'>I didn't think there was a soul in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> who didn't know Godfrey Staunton, the crack three-quarter, Cambridge, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Blackheath&t=h'>Blackheath</a>, and five Internationals. </span>
<span sid='19640' title='19640'>Good Lord! </span>
<span sid='19641' title='19641'>Mr. Holmes, where have you lived?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19642' title='19642'>Holmes laughed at the young giant's naïve astonishment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19643' title='19643'>'You live in a different world to me, Mr. Overton, a sweeter and healthier one. </span>
<span sid='19644' title='19644'>My ramifications stretch out into many sections of society, but never, I am happy to say, into amateur sport, which is the best and soundest thing in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>. </span>
<span sid='19645' title='19645'>However, your unexpected visit this morning shows me that even in that world of fresh air and fair play there may be work for me to do; so now, my good sir, I beg you to sit down and to tell me slowly and quietly exactly what it is that has occurred, and how you desire that I should help you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19646' title='19646'>Young Overton's face assumed the bothered look of the man who is more accustomed to using his muscles than his wits; but by degrees, with many repetitions and obscurities which I may omit from his narrative, he laid his strange story before us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19647' title='19647'>'It's this way, Mr. Holmes. </span>
<span sid='19648' title='19648'>As I have said, I am the skipper of the Rugger team of Cambridge 'Varsity, and Godfrey Staunton is my best man. </span>
<span sid='19649' title='19649'>To-morrow we play Oxford. </span>
<span sid='19650' title='19650'>Yesterday we all came up and we settled at Bentley's private hotel. </span>
<span sid='19651' title='19651'>At ten o'clock I went round and saw that all the fellows had gone to roost, for I believe in strict training and plenty of sleep to keep a team fit. </span>
<span sid='19652' title='19652'>I had a word or two with Godfrey before he turned in. </span>
<span sid='19653' title='19653'>He seemed to me to be pale and bothered. </span>
<span sid='19654' title='19654'>I asked him what was the matter. </span>
<span sid='19655' title='19655'>He said he was all right - just a touch of headache. </span>
<span sid='19656' title='19656'>I bade him good night and left him. </span>
<span sid='19657' title='19657'>Half an hour later the porter tells me that a rough-looking man with a beard called with a note for Godfrey. </span>
<span sid='19658' title='19658'>He had not gone to bed, and the note was taken to his room. </span>
<span sid='19659' title='19659'>Godfrey read it and fell back in a chair as if he had been pole-axed. </span>
<span sid='19660' title='19660'>The porter was so scared that he was going to fetch me, but Godfrey stopped him, had a drink of water, and pulled himself together. </span>
<span sid='19661' title='19661'>Then he went downstairs, said a few words to the man who was waiting in the hall, and the two of them went off together. </span>
<span sid='19662' title='19662'>The last that the porter saw of them, they were almost running down the street in the direction of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Strand&t=h'>the Strand</a>. </span>
<span sid='19663' title='19663'>This morning Godfrey's room was empty, his bed had never been slept in, and his things were all just as I had seen them the night before. </span>
<span sid='19664' title='19664'>He had gone off at a moment's notice with this stranger, and no word has come from him since. </span>
<span sid='19665' title='19665'>I don't believe he will ever come back He was a sportsman, was Godfrey, down to his marrow, and he wouldn't have stopped his training and let in his skipper if it were not for some cause that was too strong for him. </span>
<span sid='19666' title='19666'>No; I feel as if he were gone for good and we should never see him again.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19667' title='19667'>Sherlock Holmes listened with the deepest attention to this singular narrative.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19668' title='19668'>'What did you do?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19669' title='19669'>'I wired to Cambridge to learn if anything had been heard of him there. </span>
<span sid='19670' title='19670'>I have had an answer. </span>
<span sid='19671' title='19671'>No one has seen him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19672' title='19672'>'Could he have got back to Cambridge?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19673' title='19673'>'Yes, there is a late train - quarter-past eleven.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19674' title='19674'>'But, so far as you can ascertain, he did not take it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19675' title='19675'>'No, he has not been seen.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19676' title='19676'>'What did you do next?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19677' title='19677'>'I wired to Lord Mount-James.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19678' title='19678'>'Why to the Lord Mount-James?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19679' title='19679'>'Godfrey is an orphan, and Lord Mount-James is his nearest relative - his uncle, I believe.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19680' title='19680'>'Indeed. </span>
<span sid='19681' title='19681'>This throws new light upon the matter. </span>
<span sid='19682' title='19682'>Lord Mount-James is one of the richest men in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19683' title='19683'>'So I've heard Godfrey say.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19684' title='19684'>'And your friend was closely related?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19685' title='19685'>Yes, he was his heir, and the old boy is nearly eighty - cram full of gout, too. </span>
<span sid='19686' title='19686'>They say he could chalk his billiard-cue with his knuckles. </span>
<span sid='19687' title='19687'>He never allowed Godfrey a shilling in his life, for he is an absolute miser, but it will all come to him right enough.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19688' title='19688'>'Have you heard from Lord Mount-James?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19689' title='19689'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19690' title='19690'>'What motive could your friend have in going to Lord Mount-James?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19691' title='19691'>'Well, something was worrying him the night before, and if it was to do with money it is possible that he would make for his nearest relative who had so much of it, though from all I have heard he would not have much chance of getting it. </span>
<span sid='19692' title='19692'>Godfrey was not fond of the old man. </span>
<span sid='19693' title='19693'>He would not go if he could help it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19694' title='19694'>'Well, we can soon determine that. </span>
<span sid='19695' title='19695'>If your friend was going to his relative Lord Mount-James, you have then to explain the visit of this rough-looking fellow at so late an hour, and the agitation that was caused by his corning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19696' title='19696'>Cyril Overton pressed his hands to his head. </span>
<span sid='19697' title='19697'>'I can make nothing of it!' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19698' title='19698'>'Well, well, I have a clear day, and I shall be happy to look into the matter,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='19699' title='19699'>'I should strongly recommend you to make your preparations for your match without reference to this young gentleman. </span>
<span sid='19700' title='19700'>It must, as you say, have been an overpowering necessity which tore him away in such a fashion, and the same necessity is likely to hold him away. </span>
<span sid='19701' title='19701'>Let us step round together to this hotel, and see if the porter can throw any fresh light upon the matter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19702' title='19702'>Sherlock Holmes was a past master in the art of putting a humble witness at his ease, and very soon, in the privacy of Godfrey Staunton's abandoned room, he had extracted all that the porter had to tell. </span>
<span sid='19703' title='19703'>The visitor of the night before was not a gentleman, neither was he a working man. </span>
<span sid='19704' title='19704'>He was simply what the porter described as a 'medium-looking chap'; a man of fifty, beard grizzled, pale face, quietly dressed. </span>
<span sid='19705' title='19705'>He seemed himself to be agitated. </span>
<span sid='19706' title='19706'>The porter had observed his hand trembling when he had held out the note. </span>
<span sid='19707' title='19707'>Godfrey Staunton had crammed the note into his pocket. </span>
<span sid='19708' title='19708'>Staunton had not shaken hands with the man in the hall. </span>
<span sid='19709' title='19709'>They had exchanged a few sentences, of which the porter had only distinguished the one word 'time'. </span>
<span sid='19710' title='19710'>Then they had hurried off in the manner described. </span>
<span sid='19711' title='19711'>It was just half-past ten by the hall clock.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19712' title='19712'>'Let me see,' said Holmes, seating himself on Staunton's bed. </span>
<span sid='19713' title='19713'>'You are the day porter, are you not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19714' title='19714'>'Yes, sir; I go off duty at eleven.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19715' title='19715'>'The night porter saw nothing, I suppose?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19716' title='19716'>'No, sir; one theatre party came in late. </span>
<span sid='19717' title='19717'>No one else.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19718' title='19718'>'Were you on duty all day yesterday?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19719' title='19719'>'Yes, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19720' title='19720'>'Did you take any message to Mr. Staunton?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19721' title='19721'>'Yes, sir; one telegram.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19722' title='19722'>'Ah! that is interesting. </span>
<span sid='19723' title='19723'>What o'clock was this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19724' title='19724'>'About six.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19725' title='19725'>'Where was Mr. Staunton when he received it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19726' title='19726'>'Here in his room.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19727' title='19727'>'Were you present when he opened it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19728' title='19728'>'Yes, sir; I waited to see if there was an answer!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19729' title='19729'>'Well, was there?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19730' title='19730'>'Yes, sir. </span>
<span sid='19731' title='19731'>He wrote an answer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19732' title='19732'>'Did you take it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19733' title='19733'>'No; he took it himself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19734' title='19734'>'But he wrote it in your presence?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19735' title='19735'>'Yes, sir. </span>
<span sid='19736' title='19736'>I was standing by the door, and he with his back turned at that table. </span>
<span sid='19737' title='19737'>When he had written it he said, "All right, porter, I will take this myself."'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19738' title='19738'>'What did he write it with?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19739' title='19739'>'A pen, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19740' title='19740'>'Was the telegraphic form one of these on the table?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19741' title='19741'>'Yes, sir; it was the top one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19742' title='19742'>Holmes rose. </span>
<span sid='19743' title='19743'>Taking the forms, he carried them over to the window and carefully examined that which was uppermost.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19744' title='19744'>'It is a pity he did not write in pencil,' said he, throwing them down again with a shrug of disappointment. </span>
<span sid='19745' title='19745'>'As you have no doubt frequently observed, Watson, the impression usually goes through - a fact which has dissolved many a happy marriage. </span>
<span sid='19746' title='19746'>However, I can find no trace here. </span>
<span sid='19747' title='19747'>I rejoice, however, to perceive that he wrote with a broad-pointed quill pen, and I can hardly doubt that we will find some impression upon this blotting-pad. </span>
<span sid='19748' title='19748'>Ah, yes, surely this is the very thing!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19749' title='19749'>He tore off a strip of the blotting-paper and turned towards us the following hieroglyphic:</span>
<p>
<span sid='19750' title='19750'>Cyril Overton was much excited. </span>
<span sid='19751' title='19751'>'Hold it to the glass,' he cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19752' title='19752'>'That is unnecessary,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='19753' title='19753'>'The paper is thin, and the reverse will give the message. </span>
<span sid='19754' title='19754'>Here it is.' </span>
<span sid='19755' title='19755; #<img src=""images/MISS2.jpg"" border=""0"" />''>He turned it over, and we read:</span>
<p>
<span sid='19756' title='19756'>'So that is the tail end of the telegram which Godfrey Staunton despatched within a few hours of his disappearance. </span>
<span sid='19757' title='19757'>There are at least six words of the message which have escaped us; but what remains - "Stand by us for God's sake!" - proves that this young man saw a formidable danger which approached him, and from which someone else could protect him. </span>
<span sid='19758' title='19758'>"Us," mark you! </span>
<span sid='19759' title='19759'>Another person was involved. </span>
<span sid='19760' title='19760'>Who should it be but the pale-faced, bearded man who seemed himself in so nervous a state? </span>
<span sid='19761' title='19761'>What, then, is the connection between Godfrey Staunton and the bearded man? </span>
<span sid='19762' title='19762'>And what is the third source from which each of them sought for help against pressing danger? </span>
<span sid='19763' title='19763'>Our inquiry has already narrowed down to that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19764' title='19764'>'We have only to find to whom that telegram is addressed,' I suggested.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19765' title='19765'>'Exactly, my dear Watson. </span>
<span sid='19766' title='19766'>Your reflection, though profound, had already crossed my mind. </span>
<span sid='19767' title='19767'>But I dare say it may have come to your notice that if you walk into a post office and demand to see the counterfoil of another man's message there may be some disinclination on the part of the officials to oblige you. </span>
<span sid='19768' title='19768'>There is so much red tape in these matters! </span>
<span sid='19769' title='19769'>However, I have no doubt that with a little delicacy and finesse the end may be attained. </span>
<span sid='19770' title='19770'>Meanwhile, I should like in your presence, Mr. Overton, to go through these papers which have been left upon the table.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19771' title='19771'>There were a number of letters, bills, and notebooks, which Holmes turned over and examined with quick, nervous fingers and darting, penetrating eyes. </span>
<span sid='19772' title='19772'>'Nothing here,' he said at last. </span>
<span sid='19773' title='19773'>'By the way, I suppose your friend was a healthy young fellow - nothing amiss with him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19774' title='19774'>'Sound as a bell.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19775' title='19775'>'Have you ever known him ill?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19776' title='19776'>'Not a day. </span>
<span sid='19777' title='19777'>He has been laid up with a hack, and once he slipped his knee-cap, but that was nothing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19778' title='19778'>'Perhaps he was not so strong as you suppose. </span>
<span sid='19779' title='19779'>I should think he may have had some secret trouble. </span>
<span sid='19780' title='19780'>With your assent I will put one or two of these papers in my pocket, in case they should bear upon our future inquiry.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19781' title='19781'>'One moment, one moment!' cried a querulous voice, and we looked up to find a queer little old man jerking and twitching in the doorway. </span>
<span sid='19782' title='19782'>He was dressed in rusty black, with a very broad-brimmed top-hat and a loose white necktie - the whole effect being that of a very rustic parson or of an undertaker's mute. </span>
<span sid='19783' title='19783'>Yet, in spite of his shabby and even absurd appearance, his voice had a sharp crackle, and his manner a quick intensity which commanded attention.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19784' title='19784'>'Who are you, sir, and by what right do you touch this gentleman's papers?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19785' title='19785'>'I am a private detective, and I am endeavouring to explain his disappearance.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19786' title='19786'>'Oh, you are, are you? </span>
<span sid='19787' title='19787'>And who instructed you, eh?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19788' title='19788'>'This gentleman, Mr. Staunton's friend, was referred to me by <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19789' title='19789'>'Who are you, sir?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19790' title='19790'>'I am Cyril Overton.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19791' title='19791'>'Then it is you who sent me a telegram. </span>
<span sid='19792' title='19792'>My name is Lord Mount-James. </span>
<span sid='19793' title='19793'>I came round as quickly as the Bayswater bus would bring me. </span>
<span sid='19794' title='19794'>So you have instructed a detective?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19795' title='19795'>'Yes, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19796' title='19796'>'And are you prepared to meet the cost?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19797' title='19797'>'I have no doubt, sir, that my friend Godfrey, when we find him, will be prepared to do that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19798' title='19798'>'But if he is never found, eh? </span>
<span sid='19799' title='19799'>Answer me that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19800' title='19800'>'In that case no doubt his family-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19801' title='19801'>'Nothing of the sort, sir!' screamed the little man. </span>
<span sid='19802' title='19802'>'Don't look to me for a penny - not a penny! </span>
<span sid='19803' title='19803'>You understand that, Mr. Detective! </span>
<span sid='19804' title='19804'>I am all the family that this young man has got, and I tell you that I am not responsible. </span>
<span sid='19805' title='19805'>If he has any expectations it is due to the fact that I have never wasted money, and I do not propose to begin to do so now. </span>
<span sid='19806' title='19806'>As to those papers with which you are making so free, I may tell you that in case there should be anything of any value among them you will be held strictly to account for what you do with them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19807' title='19807'>'Very good, sir,' said Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='19808' title='19808'>'May I ask in the meanwhile whether you have yourself any theory to account for this young man's disappearance?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19809' title='19809'>'No, sir, I have not. </span>
<span sid='19810' title='19810'>He is big enough and old enough to look after himself, and if he is so foolish as to lose himself I entirely refuse to accept the responsibility of hunting for him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19811' title='19811'>'I quite understand your position,' said Holmes, with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. </span>
<span sid='19812' title='19812'>'Perhaps you don't quite understand mine. </span>
<span sid='19813' title='19813'>Godfrey Staunton appears to have been a poor man. </span>
<span sid='19814' title='19814'>If he has been kidnapped it could not have been for anything which he himself possesses. </span>
<span sid='19815' title='19815'>The fame of your wealth has gone abroad, Lord Mount-James, and it is entirely possible that a gang of thieves has secured your nephew in order to gain from him some information as to your house, your habits, and your treasure.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19816' title='19816'>The face of our unpleasant little visitor turned as white as his neckcloth.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19817' title='19817'>'Heavens, sir, what an idea! </span>
<span sid='19818' title='19818'>I never thought of such villainy! </span>
<span sid='19819' title='19819'>What inhuman rogues there are in the world! </span>
<span sid='19820' title='19820'>But Godfrey is a fine lad - a staunch lad. </span>
<span sid='19821' title='19821'>Nothing would induce him to give his old uncle away. </span>
<span sid='19822' title='19822'>I'll have the plate moved over to the bank this evening. </span>
<span sid='19823' title='19823'>In the meantime spare no pains, Mr. Detective. </span>
<span sid='19824' title='19824'>I beg you to leave no stone unturned to bring him safely back. </span>
<span sid='19825' title='19825'>As to money, well, so far as a fiver, or even a tenner, goes, you can always look to me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19826' title='19826'>Even in his chastened frame of mind the noble miser could give us no information which could help us, for he knew little of the private life of his nephew. </span>
<span sid='19827' title='19827'>Our only clue lay in the truncated telegram, and with a copy of this in his hand Holmes set forth to find a second link for his chain. </span>
<span sid='19828' title='19828'>We had shaken off Lord Mount-James, and Overton had gone to consult with the other members of his team over the misfortune which had befallen them. </span>
<span sid='19829' title='19829'>There was a telegraph office at a short distance from the hotel. </span>
<span sid='19830' title='19830'>We halted outside it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19831' title='19831'>'It's worth trying, Watson,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='19832' title='19832'>'Of course, with a warrant we could demand to see the counterfoils, but we have not reached that stage yet. </span>
<span sid='19833' title='19833'>I don't suppose they remember faces in so busy a place. </span>
<span sid='19834' title='19834'>Let us venture it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19835' title='19835'>'I am so sorry to trouble you,' said he in his blandest manner to the young woman behind the grating; 'there is some small mistake about a telegram I sent yesterday. </span>
<span sid='19836' title='19836'>I have had no answer, and I very much fear that I must have omitted to put my name at the end. </span>
<span sid='19837' title='19837'>Could you tell me if this was so?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19838' title='19838'>The young lady turned over a sheaf of counterfoils.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19839' title='19839'>'What o'clock was it?' she asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19840' title='19840'>'A little after six.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19841' title='19841'>'Whom was it to?' </span>
<span sid='19842' title='19842'>Holmes put his finger to his lips and glanced at me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19843' title='19843'>'The last words in it were "for God's sake,"' he whispered confidentially; 'I am very anxious at getting no answer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19844' title='19844'>The young woman separated one of the forms.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19845' title='19845'>'This is it. </span>
<span sid='19846' title='19846'>There is no name,' said she, smoothing it out upon the counter.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19847' title='19847'>'Then that, of course, accounts for my getting no answer,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='19848' title='19848'>'Dear me, how very stupid of me, to be sure! </span>
<span sid='19849' title='19849'>Good morning, miss, and many thanks for having relieved my mind.' </span>
<span sid='19850' title='19850'>He chuckled and rubbed his hands when we found ourselves in the street once more.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19851' title='19851'>'Well?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19852' title='19852'>'We progress, my dear Watson, we progress. </span>
<span sid='19853' title='19853'>I had seven different schemes for getting a glimpse of that telegram, but I could hardly hope to succeed the very first time.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19854' title='19854'>'And what have you gained?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19855' title='19855'>'A starting-point for our investigation.' </span>
<span sid='19856' title='19856'>He hailed a cab. </span>
<span sid='19857' title='19857'>'<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=King's Cross&t=h'>King's Cross</a> Station,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19858' title='19858'>'We have a journey, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19859' title='19859'>'Yes, I think we must run down to Cambridge together. </span>
<span sid='19860' title='19860'>All the indications seem to point in that direction.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19861' title='19861'>'Tell me,' I asked as we rattled up Gray's Inn Road, 'have you any suspicion yet as to the cause of the disappearance? </span>
<span sid='19862' title='19862'>I don't think that among all our cases I have known one where the motives were more obscure. </span>
<span sid='19863' title='19863'>Surely you don't really imagine that he may be kidnapped in order to give information against his wealthy uncle?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19864' title='19864'>'I confess, my dear Watson, that that does not appeal to me as a very probable explanation. </span>
<span sid='19865' title='19865'>It struck me, however, as being the one which was most likely to interest that exceedingly unpleasant old person.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19866' title='19866'>'It certainly did that. </span>
<span sid='19867' title='19867'>But what are your alternatives?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19868' title='19868'>'I could mention several. </span>
<span sid='19869' title='19869'>You must admit that it is curious and suggestive that this incident should occur on the eve of this important match, and should involve the only man whose presence seems essential to the success of the side. </span>
<span sid='19870' title='19870'>It may, of course, be coincidence, but it is interesting. </span>
<span sid='19871' title='19871'>Amateur sport is free from betting, but a good deal of outside betting goes on among the public, and it is possible that it might be worth someone's while to get at a player as the ruffians of the Turf get at a race-horse. </span>
<span sid='19872' title='19872'>There is one explanation. </span>
<span sid='19873' title='19873'>A second very obvious one is that this young man really is the heir of a great property, however modest his means may be at present, and it is not impossible that a plot to hold him for ransom might be concocted.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19874' title='19874'>'These theories take no account of the telegram.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19875' title='19875'>'Quite true, Watson. </span>
<span sid='19876' title='19876'>The telegram still remains the only solid thing with which we have to deal, and we must not permit our attention to wander away from it. </span>
<span sid='19877' title='19877'>It is to gain light upon the purpose of this telegram that we are now upon our way to Cambridge. </span>
<span sid='19878' title='19878'>The path of our investigation is at present obscure, but I shall be very much surprised if before evening we have not cleared it up or made a considerable advance along it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19879' title='19879'>It was already dark when we reached the old University city. </span>
<span sid='19880' title='19880'>Holmes took a cab at the station, and ordered the man to drive to the house of Dr. Leslie Armstrong. </span>
<span sid='19881' title='19881'>A few minutes later we had stopped at a large mansion in the busiest thoroughfare. </span>
<span sid='19882' title='19882'>We were shown in, and after a long wait were admitted into the consulting-room, where we found the doctor seated behind his table.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19883' title='19883'>It argues the degree in which I had lost touch with my profession that the name of Leslie Armstrong was unknown to me. </span>
<span sid='19884' title='19884'>Now I am aware that he is not only one of the heads of the medical school of the University, but a thinker of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>an reputation in more than one branch of science. </span>
<span sid='19885' title='19885'>Yet even without knowing his brilliant record one could not fail to be impressed by a mere glance at the man - the square, massive face, the brooding eyes under the thatched brows, and the granite moulding of the inflexible jaw. </span>
<span sid='19886' title='19886'>A man of deep character, a man with an alert mind, grim, ascetic, self-contained, formidable - so I read Dr. Leslie Armstrong. </span>
<span sid='19887' title='19887'>He held my friend's card in his hand, and he looked up with no very pleased expression upon his dour features.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19888' title='19888'>'I have heard your name, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and I am aware of your profession, one of which I by no means approve.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19889' title='19889'>'In that, doctor, you will find yourself in agreement with every criminal in the country,' said my friend quietly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19890' title='19890'>'So far as your efforts are directed towards the suppression of crime, sir, they must have the support of every reasonable member of the community, though I cannot doubt that the official machinery is amply sufficient for the purpose. </span>
<span sid='19891' title='19891'>Where your calling is more open to criticism is when you pry into the secrets of private individuals, when you rake up family matters which are better hidden, and when you incidentally waste the time of men who are more busy than yourself. </span>
<span sid='19892' title='19892'>At the present moment, for example, I should be writing a treatise instead of conversing with you!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19893' title='19893'>'No doubt, doctor; and yet the conversation may prove more important than the treatise. </span>
<span sid='19894' title='19894'>Incidentally I may tell you that we are doing the reverse of what you very justly blame, and that we are endeavouring to prevent anything like public exposure of private matters which must necessarily follow when once the case is fairly in the hands of the official police. </span>
<span sid='19895' title='19895'>You may look upon me simply as an irregular pioneer who goes in front of the regular force of the country. </span>
<span sid='19896' title='19896'>I have come to ask you about Mr. Godfrey Staunton.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19897' title='19897'>'What about him!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19898' title='19898'>'You know him, do you not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19899' title='19899'>'He is an intimate friend of mine.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19900' title='19900'>'You are aware that he has disappeared?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19901' title='19901'>'Ah, indeed!' </span>
<span sid='19902' title='19902'>There was no change of expression in the rugged features of the doctor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19903' title='19903'>'He left his hotel last night. </span>
<span sid='19904' title='19904'>He has not been heard of.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19905' title='19905'>'No doubt he will return.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19906' title='19906'>'To-morrow is the 'Varsity football match.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19907' title='19907'>'I have no sympathy with these childish games. </span>
<span sid='19908' title='19908'>The young man's fate interests me deeply, since I know him and like him. </span>
<span sid='19909' title='19909'>The football match does not come within my horizon at all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19910' title='19910'>'I claim your sympathy, then, in my investigation of Mr. Staunton's fate. </span>
<span sid='19911' title='19911'>Do you know where he is?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19912' title='19912'>'Certainly not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19913' title='19913'>'You have not seen him since yesterday?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19914' title='19914'>'No, I have not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19915' title='19915'>'Was Mr. Staunton a healthy man?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19916' title='19916'>'Absolutely.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19917' title='19917'>'Did you ever know him ill?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19918' title='19918'>'Never.' </span>
<span sid='19919' title='19919'>Holmes popped a sheet of paper before the doctor's eyes. </span>
<span sid='19920' title='19920'>'Then perhaps you will explain this receipted bill for thirteen guineas, paid by Mr. Godfrey Staunton last month to Dr. Leslie Armstrong, of Cambridge. </span>
<span sid='19921' title='19921'>I picked it out from among the papers upon his desk.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19922' title='19922'>The doctor flushed with anger.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19923' title='19923'>'I do not feel that there is any reason why I should render an explanation to you, Mr. Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19924' title='19924'>Holmes replaced the bill in his notebook.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19925' title='19925'>'If you prefer a public explanation it must come sooner or later,' said he. </span>
<span sid='19926' title='19926'>'I have already told you that I can hush up that which others will be bound to publish, and you would really be wiser to take me into your complete confidence.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19927' title='19927'>'I know nothing about it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19928' title='19928'>'Did you hear from Mr. Staunton in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19929' title='19929'>'Certainly not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19930' title='19930'>'Dear me, dear me! - the post office again!' </span>
<span sid='19931' title='19931'>Holmes sighed wearily. </span>
<span sid='19932' title='19932'>'A most urgent telegram was despatched to you from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> by Godfrey Staunton at six-fifteen yesterday evening - a telegram which is undoubtedly associated with his disappearance - and yet you have not had it. </span>
<span sid='19933' title='19933'>It is most culpable. </span>
<span sid='19934' title='19934'>I shall certainly go down to the office here and register a complaint.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19935' title='19935'>Dr. Leslie Armstrong sprang up from behind his desk, and his dark face was crimson with fury.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19936' title='19936'>'I'll trouble you to walk out of my house, sir,' said he. </span>
<span sid='19937' title='19937'>'You can tell your employer, Lord Mount-James, that I do not wish to have anything to do either with him or with his agents. </span>
<span sid='19938' title='19938'>No, sir, not another word!' </span>
<span sid='19939' title='19939'>He rang the bell furiously. </span>
<span sid='19940' title='19940'>'John, show these gentlemen out.' </span>
<span sid='19941' title='19941'>A pompous butler ushered us severely to the door, and we found ourselves in the street. </span>
<span sid='19942' title='19942'>Holmes burst out laughing.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19943' title='19943'>'Dr. Leslie Armstrong is certainly a man of energy and character,' said he. </span>
<span sid='19944' title='19944'>'I have not seen a man who, if he turned his talents that way, was more calculated to fill the gap left by the illustrious Moriarty. </span>
<span sid='19945' title='19945'>And now, my poor Watson, here we are, stranded and friendless, in this inhospitable town, which we cannot leave without abandoning our case. </span>
<span sid='19946' title='19946'>This little inn just opposite Armstrong's house is singularly adapted to our needs. </span>
<span sid='19947' title='19947'>If you would engage a front room and purchase the necessaries for the night, I may have time to make a few inquiries.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19948' title='19948'>These few inquiries proved, however, to be a more lengthy proceeding than Holmes had imagined, for he did not return to the inn until nearly nine o'clock. </span>
<span sid='19949' title='19949'>He was pale and dejected, stained with dust, and exhausted with hunger and fatigue. </span>
<span sid='19950' title='19950'>A cold supper was ready upon the table, and when his needs were satisfied and his pipe alight he was ready to take that half-comic and wholly philosophic view which was natural to him when his affairs were going awry. </span>
<span sid='19951' title='19951'>The sound of carriage wheels caused him to rise and glance out of the window. </span>
<span sid='19952' title='19952'>A brougham and pair of greys under the glare of a gas-lamp stood before the doctor's door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19953' title='19953'>'It's been out three hours,' said Holmes; 'started at half-past six, and here it is back again. </span>
<span sid='19954' title='19954'>That gives a radius of ten or twelve miles, and he does it once, or sometimes twice, a day.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19955' title='19955'>'No unusual thing for a doctor in practice.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19956' title='19956'>'But Armstrong is not really a doctor in practice. </span>
<span sid='19957' title='19957'>He is a lecturer and a consultant, but he does not care for general practice, which distracts him from his literary work. </span>
<span sid='19958' title='19958'>Why, then, does he make these long journeys, which must be exceedingly irksome to him, and who is it that he visits?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19959' title='19959'>'His coachman-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19960' title='19960'>'My dear Watson, can you doubt that it was to him that I first applied? </span>
<span sid='19961' title='19961'>I do not know whether it came from his own innate depravity or from the promptings of his master, but he was rude enough to set a dog at me. </span>
<span sid='19962' title='19962'>Neither dog nor man liked the look of my stick, however, and the matter fell through. </span>
<span sid='19963' title='19963'>Relations were strained after that, and further inquiries out of the question. </span>
<span sid='19964' title='19964'>All that I have learned I got from a friendly native in the yard of our own inn. </span>
<span sid='19965' title='19965'>It was he who told me of the doctor's habits and of his daily journey. </span>
<span sid='19966' title='19966'>At that instant, to give point to his words, the carriage came round to the door.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19967' title='19967'>'Could you not follow it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19968' title='19968'>'Excellent, Watson! </span>
<span sid='19969' title='19969'>You are scintillating this evening. </span>
<span sid='19970' title='19970'>The idea did cross my mind. </span>
<span sid='19971' title='19971'>There is, as you may have observed, a bicycle shop next to our inn. </span>
<span sid='19972' title='19972'>Into this I rushed, engaged a bicycle, and was able to get started before the carriage was quite out of sight. </span>
<span sid='19973' title='19973'>I rapidly overtook it, and then, keeping at a discreet distance of a hundred yards or so, I followed its lights until we were clear of the town. </span>
<span sid='19974' title='19974'>He had got well out on the country road when a somewhat mortifying incident occurred. </span>
<span sid='19975' title='19975'>The carriage stopped, the doctor alighted, walked swiftly back to where I had also halted, and told me in an excellent sardonic fashion that he feared the road was narrow, and that he hoped his carriage did not impede the passage of my bicycle. </span>
<span sid='19976' title='19976'>Nothing could have been more admirable than his way of putting it. </span>
<span sid='19977' title='19977'>I at once rode past the carriage, and, keeping to the main road, I went on for a few miles, and then halted in a convenient place to see if the carriage passed. </span>
<span sid='19978' title='19978'>There was no sign of it, however, and so it became evident that it had turned down one of several side-roads which I had observed. </span>
<span sid='19979' title='19979'>I rode back, but again saw nothing of the carriage, and now, as you perceive, it has returned after me. </span>
<span sid='19980' title='19980'>Of course, I had at the outset no particular reason to connect these journeys with the disappearance of Godfrey Staunton, and was only inclined to investigate them on the general grounds that everything which concerns Dr. Armstrong is at present of interest to us; but, now that I find he keeps so keen a lookout upon anyone who may follow him on these excursions, the affair appears more important, and I shall not be satisfied until I have made the matter clear.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19981' title='19981'>'We can follow him to-morrow.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19982' title='19982'>'Can we? </span>
<span sid='19983' title='19983'>It is not so easy as you seem to think. </span>
<span sid='19984' title='19984'>You are not familiar with Cambridgeshire scenery, are you? </span>
<span sid='19985' title='19985'>It does not lend itself to concealment. </span>
<span sid='19986' title='19986'>All this country that I passed over to-night is as flat and clean as the palm of your hand, and the man we are following is no fool, as he very clearly showed to-night. </span>
<span sid='19987' title='19987'>I have wired to Overton to let us know any fresh <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> developments at this address, and in the meantime we can only concentrate our attention upon Dr. Armstrong, whose name the obliging young lady at the office allowed me to read upon the counterfoil of Staunton's urgent message. </span>
<span sid='19988' title='19988'>He knows where that young man is - to that I'll swear - and if he knows, then it must be our own fault if we cannot manage to know also. </span>
<span sid='19989' title='19989'>At present it must be admitted that the odd trick is in his possession, and, as you are aware, Watson, it is not my habit to leave the game in that condition.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='19990' title='19990'>And yet the next day brought us no nearer to the solution of the mystery. </span>
<span sid='19991' title='19991'>A note was handed in after breakfast, which Holmes passed across to me with a smile.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19992' title='19992'>SIR [it ran] - I can assure you that you are wasting your time in dogging my movements. </span>
<span sid='19993' title='19993'>I have, as you discovered last night, a window at the back of my brougham, and if you desire a twenty-mile ride which will lead you to the spot from which you started, you have only to follow me. </span>
<span sid='19994' title='19994'>Meanwhile, I can inform you that no spying upon me can in any way help Mr. Godfrey Staunton, and I am convinced that the best service you can do to that gentleman is to return at once to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> and to report to your employer that you are unable to trace him. </span>
<span sid='19995' title='19995'>Your time in Cambridge will certainly be wasted.</span>
<p>
<span sid='19996' title='19996'>Yours faithfully,</span>
<p>
<span sid='19997' title='19997'>LESLIE ARMSTRONG</span>
<p>
<span sid='19998' title='19998'>'An outspoken, honest antagonist is the doctor,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='19999' title='19999'>'Well, well, he excites my curiosity, and I must really know more before I leave him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20000' title='20000'>'His carriage is at his door now,' said I. </span>
<span sid='20001' title='20001'>'There he is stepping into it. </span>
<span sid='20002' title='20002'>I saw him glance up at our window as he did so. </span>
<span sid='20003' title='20003'>Suppose I try my luck upon the bicycle?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20004' title='20004'>'No, no, my dear Watson! </span>
<span sid='20005' title='20005'>With all respect for your natural acumen, I do not think that you are quite a match for the worthy doctor. </span>
<span sid='20006' title='20006'>I think that possibly I can attain our end by some independent explorations of my own. </span>
<span sid='20007' title='20007'>I am afraid that I must leave you to your own devices, as the appearance of two inquiring strangers upon a sleepy country-side might excite more gossip than I care for. </span>
<span sid='20008' title='20008'>No doubt you will find some sights to amuse you in this venerable city, and I hope to bring back a more favourable report to you before evening.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20009' title='20009'>Once more, however, my friend was destined to be disappointed. </span>
<span sid='20010' title='20010'>He came back at night weary and unsuccessful.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20011' title='20011'>'I have had a blank day, Watson. </span>
<span sid='20012' title='20012'>Having got the doctor's general direction, I spent the day in visiting all the villages upon that side of Cambridge, and comparing notes with publicans and other local news agencies. </span>
<span sid='20013' title='20013'>I have covered some ground: Chesterton, Histon, Waterbeach, and Oakington have each been explored, and have each proved disappointing. </span>
<span sid='20014' title='20014'>The daily appearance of a brougham and pair could hardly have been overlooked in such Sleepy Hollows.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20015' title='20015'>The doctor has scored once more. </span>
<span sid='20016' title='20016'>Is there a telegram for me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20017' title='20017'>'Yes; I opened it. </span>
<span sid='20018' title='20018'>Here it is: "Ask for Pompey from Jeremy Dixon, Trinity College." </span>
<span sid='20019' title='20019'>I don't understand it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20020' title='20020'>'Oh, it is clear enough. </span>
<span sid='20021' title='20021'>It is from our friend Overton, and is in answer to a question from me. </span>
<span sid='20022' title='20022'>I'll just send round a note to Mr. Jeremy Dixon, and then I have no doubt that our luck will turn. </span>
<span sid='20023' title='20023'>By the way, is there any news of the match?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20024' title='20024'>'Yes, the local evening paper has an excellent account in its last edition. </span>
<span sid='20025' title='20025'>Oxford won by a goal and two tries. </span>
<span sid='20026' title='20026'>The last sentences of the description say: "The defeat of the Light Blues may be entirely attributed to the unfortunate absence of the crack International, Godfrey Staunton, whose want was felt at every instant of the game. </span>
<span sid='20027' title='20027'>The lack of combination in the three-quarter line and their weakness both in attack and defence more than neutralized the efforts of a heavy and hard-working pack."'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20028' title='20028'>'Then our friend Overton's forebodings have been justified,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='20029' title='20029'>'Personally I am in agreement with Dr. Armstrong, and football does not come within my horizon. </span>
<span sid='20030' title='20030'>Early to bed to-night, Watson, for I foresee that to-morrow may be an eventful day.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20031' title='20031'>I was horrified by my first glimpse of Holmes next morning, for he sat by the fire holding his tiny hypodermic syringe. </span>
<span sid='20032' title='20032'>I associated that with the single weakness of his nature, and I feared the worst when I saw it glittering in his hand. </span>
<span sid='20033' title='20033'>He laughed at my expression of dismay, and laid it upon the table. </span>
<span sid='20034' title='20034'>'No, no, my dear fellow, there is no cause for alarm. </span>
<span sid='20035' title='20035'>It is not upon this occasion the instrument of evil, but it will rather prove to be the key which will unlock our mystery. </span>
<span sid='20036' title='20036'>On this syringe I base all my hopes. </span>
<span sid='20037' title='20037'>I have just returned from a small scouting expedition, and everything is favourable. </span>
<span sid='20038' title='20038'>Eat a good breakfast, Watson, for I propose to get upon Dr. Armstrong's trail to-day, and once on it I will not stop for rest or food until I run him to his burrow.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20039' title='20039'>'In that case,' said I, 'we had best carry our breakfast with us, for he is making an early start. </span>
<span sid='20040' title='20040'>His carriage is at the door.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20041' title='20041'>'Never mind. </span>
<span sid='20042' title='20042'>Let him go. </span>
<span sid='20043' title='20043'>He will be clever if he can drive where I cannot follow him. </span>
<span sid='20044' title='20044'>When you have finished come downstairs with me, and I will introduce you to a detective who is a very eminent specialist in the work that lies before us.' </span>
<span sid='20045' title='20045'>When we descended I followed Holmes into the stable-yard, where he opened the door of a loose-box and led out a squat, lop-eared, white-and-tan dog, something between a beagle and a foxhound.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20046' title='20046'>'Let me introduce you to Pompey,' said he. </span>
<span sid='20047' title='20047'>'Pompey is the pride of the local drag-hounds, no very great flier, as his build will show, but a staunch hound on a scent. </span>
<span sid='20048' title='20048'>Well, Pompey, you may not be fast, but I expect you will be too fast for a couple of middle-aged <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> gentlemen, so I will take the liberty of fastening this leather leash to your collar. </span>
<span sid='20049' title='20049'>Now, boy, come along, and show what you can do.' </span>
<span sid='20050' title='20050'>He led him across to the doctor's door. </span>
<span sid='20051' title='20051'>The dog sniffed round for an instant, and then with a shrill whine of excitement started off down the street, tugging at his leash in his efforts to go faster. </span>
<span sid='20052' title='20052'>In half an hour we were clear of the town and hastening down a country road.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20053' title='20053'>'What have you done, Holmes?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20054' title='20054'>'A threadbare and venerable device, but useful upon occasion. </span>
<span sid='20055' title='20055'>I walked into the doctor's yard this morning and shot my syringe full of aniseed over the hind wheel. </span>
<span sid='20056' title='20056'>A drag-hound will follow aniseed from here to John o' Groats, and our friend Armstrong would have to drive through the Cam before he would shake Pompey off his trail. </span>
<span sid='20057' title='20057'>Oh, the cunning rascal! </span>
<span sid='20058' title='20058'>This is how he gave me the slip the other night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20059' title='20059'>The dog had suddenly turned out of the main road into a grass-grown lane. </span>
<span sid='20060' title='20060'>Half a mile farther this opened into another broad road, and the trail turned hard to the right in the direction of the town, which we had just quitted. </span>
<span sid='20061' title='20061'>The road took a sweep to the south of the town and continued in the opposite direction to that in which we started.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20062' title='20062'>'This detour has been entirely for our benefit, then?' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='20063' title='20063'>'No wonder that my inquiries among those villages led to nothing. </span>
<span sid='20064' title='20064'>The doctor has certainly played the game for all it is worth, and one would like to know the reason for such elaborate deception. </span>
<span sid='20065' title='20065'>This should be the village of Trumpington to the right of us. </span>
<span sid='20066' title='20066'>And, by Jove! </span>
<span sid='20067' title='20067'>here is the brougham coming round the corner! </span>
<span sid='20068' title='20068'>Quick, Watson, quick, or we are done!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20069' title='20069'>He sprang through a gate into a field, dragging the reluctant Pompey after him. </span>
<span sid='20070' title='20070'>We had hardly got under the shelter of the hedge when the carriage rattled past. </span>
<span sid='20071' title='20071'>I caught a glimpse of Dr. Armstrong within, his shoulders bowed, his head sunk on his hands, the very image of distress. </span>
<span sid='20072' title='20072'>I could tell by my companion's graver face that he also had seen.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20073' title='20073'>'I fear there is some dark ending to our quest,' said he. </span>
<span sid='20074' title='20074'>'It cannot be long before we know it. </span>
<span sid='20075' title='20075'>Come, Pompey! </span>
<span sid='20076' title='20076'>Ah, it is the cottage in the field.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20077' title='20077'>There could be no doubt that we had reached the end of our journey. </span>
<span sid='20078' title='20078'>Pompey ran about and whined eagerly outside the gate, where the marks of the brougham's wheels were still to be seen. </span>
<span sid='20079' title='20079'>A footpath led across to the lonely cottage. </span>
<span sid='20080' title='20080'>Holmes tied the dog to the hedge, and we hastened onwards. </span>
<span sid='20081' title='20081'>My friend knocked at the little rustic door, and knocked again without response. </span>
<span sid='20082' title='20082'>And yet the cottage was not deserted, for a low sound came to our ears - a kind of drone of misery and despair, which was indescribably melancholy. </span>
<span sid='20083' title='20083'>Holmes paused irresolute, and then he glanced back at the road which we had just traversed. </span>
<span sid='20084' title='20084'>A brougham was coming down it, and there could be no mistaking those grey horses.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20085' title='20085'>'By Jove, the doctor is coming back!' cried Holmes. </span>
<span sid='20086' title='20086'>'That settles it. </span>
<span sid='20087' title='20087'>We are bound to see what it means before he comes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20088' title='20088'>He opened the door, and we stepped into the hall. </span>
<span sid='20089' title='20089'>The droning sound swelled louder upon our ears, until it became one long, deep wail of distress. </span>
<span sid='20090' title='20090'>It came from upstairs. </span>
<span sid='20091' title='20091'>Holmes darted up, and I followed him. </span>
<span sid='20092' title='20092'>He pushed open a half-closed door, and we both stood appalled at the sight before us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20093' title='20093'>A woman, young and beautiful, was lying dead upon the bed. </span>
<span sid='20094' title='20094'>Her calm, pale face, with dim, wide-opened blue eyes, looked upwards from amid a great tangle of golden hair. </span>
<span sid='20095' title='20095'>At the foot of the bed, half sitting, half kneeling, his face buried in the clothes, was a young man, whose frame was racked by his sobs. </span>
<span sid='20096' title='20096'>So absorbed was he by his bitter grief that he never looked up until Holmes's hand was on his shoulder.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20097' title='20097'>'Are you Mr. Godfrey Staunton?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20098' title='20098'>'Yes, yes; I am - but you are too late. </span>
<span sid='20099' title='20099'>She is dead.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20100' title='20100'>The man was so dazed that he could not be made to understand that we were anything but doctors who had been sent to his assistance. </span>
<span sid='20101' title='20101'>Holmes was endeavouring to utter a few words of consolation, and to explain the alarm which had been caused to his friends by his sudden disappearance, when there was a step upon the stairs, and there was the heavy, stern, questioning face of Dr. Armstrong at the door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20102' title='20102'>'So, gentlemen,' said he, 'you have attained your end, and have certainly chosen a particularly delicate moment for your intrusion. </span>
<span sid='20103' title='20103'>I would not brawl in the presence of death, but I can assure you that if I were a younger man your monstrous conduct would not pass with impunity.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20104' title='20104'>'Excuse me, Dr. Armstrong, I think we are a little at cross purposes,' said my friend with dignity. </span>
<span sid='20105' title='20105'>'If you could step downstairs with us we may each be able to give some light to the other upon this miserable affair.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20106' title='20106'>A minute later the grim doctor and ourselves were in the sitting-room below.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20107' title='20107'>'Well, sir?' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20108' title='20108'>'I wish you to understand, in the first place, that I am not employed by Lord Mount-James, and that my sympathies in this matter are entirely against that nobleman. </span>
<span sid='20109' title='20109'>When a man is lost it is my duty to ascertain his fate, but having done so the matter ends so far as I am concerned; and so long as there is nothing criminal, I am much more anxious to hush up private scandals than to give them publicity. </span>
<span sid='20110' title='20110'>If, as I imagine, there is no breach of the law in this matter, you can absolutely depend upon my discretion and my co-operation in keeping the facts out of the papers!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20111' title='20111'>Dr. Armstrong took a quick step forward and wrung Holmes by the hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20112' title='20112'>'You are a good fellow,' said he. </span>
<span sid='20113' title='20113'>'I had misjudged you. </span>
<span sid='20114' title='20114'>I thank Heaven that my compunction at leaving poor Staunton all alone in this plight caused me to turn my carriage back, and so to make your acquaintance. </span>
<span sid='20115' title='20115'>Knowing as much as you do, the situation is very easily explained. </span>
<span sid='20116' title='20116'>A year ago Godfrey Staunton lodged in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> for a time, and became passionately attached to his landlady's daughter, whom he married. </span>
<span sid='20117' title='20117'>She was as good as she was beautiful, and as intelligent as she was good. </span>
<span sid='20118' title='20118'>No man need be ashamed of such a wife. </span>
<span sid='20119' title='20119'>But Godfrey was the heir to this crabbed old nobleman, and it was quite certain that the news of his marriage would have been the end of his inheritance. </span>
<span sid='20120' title='20120'>I knew the lad well, and I loved him for his many excellent qualities. </span>
<span sid='20121' title='20121'>I did all I could to help him to keep things straight. </span>
<span sid='20122' title='20122'>We did our very best to keep the thing from everyone, for when once such a whisper gets about it is not long before everyone has heard it. </span>
<span sid='20123' title='20123'>Thanks to this lonely cottage and his own discretion, Godfrey has up to now succeeded. </span>
<span sid='20124' title='20124'>Their secret was known to no one save to me and to one excellent servant who has at present gone for assistance to Trumpington. </span>
<span sid='20125' title='20125'>But at last there came a terrible blow in the shape of dangerous illness to his wife. </span>
<span sid='20126' title='20126'>It was consumption of the most virulent kind. </span>
<span sid='20127' title='20127'>The poor boy was half crazed with grief, and yet he had to go to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> to play this match, for he could not get out of it without explanations which would expose the secret. </span>
<span sid='20128' title='20128'>I tried to cheer him up by a wire, and he sent me one in reply imploring me to do all I could. </span>
<span sid='20129' title='20129'>This was the telegram which you appear in some inexplicable way to have seen. </span>
<span sid='20130' title='20130'>I did not tell him how urgent the danger was, for I knew that he could do no good here, but I sent the truth to the girl's father, and he very injudiciously communicated it to Godfrey. </span>
<span sid='20131' title='20131'>The result was that he came straight away in a state bordering on frenzy, and has remained in the same state, kneeling at the end of her bed, until this morning death put an end to her sufferings. </span>
<span sid='20132' title='20132'>That is all, Mr. Holmes, and I am sure that I can rely upon your discretion and that of your friend.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20133' title='20133'>Holmes grasped the doctor's hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20134' title='20134'>'Come, Watson,' said he, and we passed from that house of grief into the pale sunlight of the winter day.</span>
