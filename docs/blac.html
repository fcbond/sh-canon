<h1><span sid='42899' title='42899'>The Adventure of Black Peter</span></h1>
<p class="subtitle">Arthur Conan Doyle<label for="sn-meta-blac" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-meta-blac" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><!--googleoff: all--><b>Story Number</b>: 33<br><b>Published in</b>: The Collier's magazine, 27 February 1904 (US)<br><b>Collected in</b>: The Return of Sherlock Holmes<!--googleon: all--></span></p>
<p>
<span sid='42900' title='42900'>I have never known my friend to be in better form, both mental and physical, than in the year '95. </span>
<span sid='42901' title='42901'>His increasing fame had brought with it an immense practice, and I should be guilty of an indiscretion if I were even to hint at the identity of some of the illustrious clients who crossed our humble threshold in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='42902' title='42902'>Holmes, however, like all great artists, lived for his art's sake, and, save in the case of the Duke of Holdernesse, I have seldom known him claim any large reward for his inestimable services. </span>
<span sid='42903' title='42903'>So unworldly was he - or so capricious - that he frequently refused his help to the powerful and wealthy where the problem made no appeal to his sympathies, while he would devote weeks of most intense application to the affairs of some humble client whose case presented those strange and dramatic qualities which appealed to his imagination and challenged his ingenuity.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42904' title='42904'>In this memorable year '95 a curious and incongruous succession of cases had engaged his attention, ranging from his famous investigation of the sudden death of Cardinal Tosca - an inquiry which was carried out by him at the express desire of his Holiness the Pope - down to his arrest of Wilson, the notorious canary-trainer, which removed a plague-spot from the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=East End&t=h'>East End</a> of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='42905' title='42905'>Close on the heels of these two famous cases came the tragedy of Woodman's Lee, and the very obscure circumstances which surrounded the death of Captain Peter Carey. </span>
<span sid='42906' title='42906'>No record of the doings of Mr Sherlock Holmes would be complete which did not include some account of this very unusual affair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42907' title='42907'>During the first week of July my friend had been absent so often and so long from our lodgings that I knew he had something on hand. </span>
<span sid='42908' title='42908'>The fact that several rough-looking men called during that time and inquired for Captain Basil made me understand that Holmes was working somewhere under one of the numerous disguises and names with which he concealed his own formidable identity. </span>
<span sid='42909' title='42909'>He had at least five small refuges in different parts of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> in which he was able to change his personality. </span>
<span sid='42910' title='42910'>He said nothing of his business to me, and it was not my habit to force a confidence. </span>
<span sid='42911' title='42911'>The first positive sign which he gave me of the direction which his investigation was taking was an extraordinary one. </span>
<span sid='42912' title='42912'>He had gone out before breakfast, and I had sat down to mine, when he strode into the room, his hat upon his head, and a huge barb-headed spear tucked like an umbrella under his arm.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42913' title='42913'>'Good gracious, Holmes!' I cried. </span>
<span sid='42914' title='42914'>'You don't mean to say that you have been walking about <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> with that thing?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42915' title='42915'>'I drove to the butcher's and back.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42916' title='42916'>'The butcher's?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42917' title='42917'>'And I return with an excellent appetite. </span>
<span sid='42918' title='42918'>There can be no question, my dear Watson, of the value of exercise before breakfast. </span>
<span sid='42919' title='42919'>But I am prepared to bet that you will not guess the form that my exercise has taken.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42920' title='42920'>'I will not attempt it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42921' title='42921'>He chuckled as he poured out the coffee.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42922' title='42922'>'If you could have looked into Allardyce's back shop you would have seen a dead pig swung from a hook in the ceiling, and a gentleman in his shirt-sleeves furiously stabbing at it with this weapon. </span>
<span sid='42923' title='42923'>I was that energetic person, and I have satisfied myself that by no exertion of my strength can I transfix the pig with a single blow. </span>
<span sid='42924' title='42924'>Perhaps you would care to try?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42925' title='42925'>'Not for worlds. </span>
<span sid='42926' title='42926'>But why were you doing this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42927' title='42927'>'Because it seemed to me to have an indirect bearing upon the mystery of Woodman's Lee. </span>
<span sid='42928' title='42928'>Ah, Hopkins, I got your wire last night, and I have been expecting you. </span>
<span sid='42929' title='42929'>Come and join us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42930' title='42930'>Our visitor was an exceedingly alert man, thirty years of age, dressed in a quiet tweed suit, but retaining the erect bearing of one who was accustomed to official uniform. </span>
<span sid='42931' title='42931'>I recognized him at once as Stanley Hopkins, a young police inspector for whose future Holmes had high hopes, while he in turn professed the admiration and respect of a pupil for the scientific methods of the famous amateur. </span>
<span sid='42932' title='42932'>Hopkins's brow was clouded and he sat down with an air of deep dejection.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42933' title='42933'>'No, thank you, sir. </span>
<span sid='42934' title='42934'>I breakfasted before I came round. </span>
<span sid='42935' title='42935'>I spend the night in town, for I came up yesterday to report.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42936' title='42936'>'And what had you to report?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42937' title='42937'>'Failure, sir - absolute failure.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42938' title='42938'>'You have made no progress?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42939' title='42939'>'None.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42940' title='42940'>'Dear me! </span>
<span sid='42941' title='42941'>I must have a look at the matter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42942' title='42942'>'I wish to heavens that you would, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='42943' title='42943'>It's my first big chance, and I am at my wits' end. </span>
<span sid='42944' title='42944'>For goodness' sake come down and lend me a hand.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42945' title='42945'>'Well, well, it happens that I have already read all the available evidence, including the report of the inquest, with some care. </span>
<span sid='42946' title='42946'>By the way, what do you make of that tobacco- pouch found on the scene of the crime? </span>
<span sid='42947' title='42947'>Is there no clue there?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42948' title='42948'>Hopkins looked surprised.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42949' title='42949'>'It was the man's own pouch, sir. </span>
<span sid='42950' title='42950'>His initials were inside it. </span>
<span sid='42951' title='42951'>And it was of sealskin - and he was an old sealer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42952' title='42952'>'But he had no pipe.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42953' title='42953'>'No, sir, we could find no pipe; indeed, he smoked very little. </span>
<span sid='42954' title='42954'>And yet he might have kept some tobacco for his friends.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42955' title='42955'>'No doubt. </span>
<span sid='42956' title='42956'>I only mention it because if I had been handling the case I should have been inclined to make that the starting-point of my investigation. </span>
<span sid='42957' title='42957'>However, my friend Dr Watson knows nothing of this matter, and I should be none the worse for hearing the sequence of events once more. </span>
<span sid='42958' title='42958'>Just give us some short sketch of the essentials.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42959' title='42959'>Stanley Hopkins drew a slip of paper from his pocket.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42960' title='42960'>'I have a few dates here which will give you the career of the dead man, Captain Peter Carey. </span>
<span sid='42961' title='42961'>He was born in '45 - fifty years of age. </span>
<span sid='42962' title='42962'>He was a most daring and successful seal and whale fisher. </span>
<span sid='42963' title='42963'>In 1883 he commanded the steam sealer Sea Unicorn, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Dundee&t=h'>Dundee</a>. </span>
<span sid='42964' title='42964'>He had then had several successful voyages in succession, and in the following year, 1884, he retired. </span>
<span sid='42965' title='42965'>After that he travelled for some years, and finally he bought a small place called Woodman's Lee, near Forest Row, in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sussex&t=h'>Sussex</a>. </span>
<span sid='42966' title='42966'>There he has lived for six years, and there he died just a week ago to-day.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42967' title='42967'>'There were some most singular points about the man. </span>
<span sid='42968' title='42968'>In ordinary life he was a strict Puritan - a silent, gloomy fellow. </span>
<span sid='42969' title='42969'>His household consisted of his wife, his daughter, aged twenty, and two female servants. </span>
<span sid='42970' title='42970'>These last were continually changing, for it was never a very cheery situation, and sometimes it became past all bearing. </span>
<span sid='42971' title='42971'>The man was an intermittent drunkard, and when he had the fit on him he was a perfect fiend. </span>
<span sid='42972' title='42972'>He has been known to drive his wife and his daughter out of doors in the middle of the night, and flog them through the park until the whole village outside the gates was aroused by their screams.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42973' title='42973'>'He was summoned once for a savage assault upon the old vicar, who had called upon him to remonstrate with him upon his conduct. </span>
<span sid='42974' title='42974'>In short, Mr Holmes, you would go far before you found a more dangerous man than Peter Carey, and I have heard that he bore the same character when he commanded his ship. </span>
<span sid='42975' title='42975'>He was known in the trade as Black Peter, and the name was given him, not only on account of his swarthy features and the colour of his huge beard, but for the humours which were the terror of all around him. </span>
<span sid='42976' title='42976'>I need not say that he was loathed and avoided by every one of his neighbours, and that I have not heard one single word of sorrow about his terrible end.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42977' title='42977'>'You must have read in the account of the inquest about the man's cabin, Mr Holmes; but perhaps your friend here has not heard of it. </span>
<span sid='42978' title='42978'>He had built himself a wooden outhouse - he always called it "the cabin" - a few hundred yards from his house, and it was here that he slept every night. </span>
<span sid='42979' title='42979'>It was a little, single-roomed hut, sixteen feet by ten. </span>
<span sid='42980' title='42980'>He kept the key in his pocket, made his own bed, cleaned it himself, and allowed no other foot to cross the threshold. </span>
<span sid='42981' title='42981'>There are small windows on each side, which were covered by curtains, and never opened. </span>
<span sid='42982' title='42982'>One of these windows was turned towards the high road, and when the light burned in it at night the folk used to point it out to each other, and wonder what Black Peter was doing in there. </span>
<span sid='42983' title='42983'>That's the window, Mr Holmes, which gave us one of the few bits of positive evidence that came out at the inquest.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42984' title='42984'>'You remember that a stonemason, named Slater, walking from Forest Row about one o'clock in the morning -  two days before the murder - stopped as he passed the grounds and looked at the square of light still shining among the trees. </span>
<span sid='42985' title='42985'>He swears that the shadow of a man's head turned sideways was clearly visible on the blind, and that this shadow was certainly not that of Peter Carey, whom he knew well. </span>
<span sid='42986' title='42986'>It was that of a bearded man, but the beard was short, and bristled forwards in a way very different from that of the captain. </span>
<span sid='42987' title='42987'>So he says, but he had been two hours in the public-house, and it is some distance from the road to the window. </span>
<span sid='42988' title='42988'>Besides, this refers to the Monday, and the crime was done upon the Wednesday.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42989' title='42989'>'On the Tuesday Peter Carey was in one of his blackest moods, flushed with drink and as savage as a dangerous wild beast. </span>
<span sid='42990' title='42990'>He roamed about the house, and the women ran for it when they heard him coming. </span>
<span sid='42991' title='42991'>Late in the evening he went down to his own hut. </span>
<span sid='42992' title='42992'>About two o'clock the following morning his daughter, who slept with her window open, heard a most fearful yell from that direction, but it was no unusual thing for him to bawl and shout when he was in drink, so no notice was taken. </span>
<span sid='42993' title='42993'>On rising at seven one of the maids noticed that the door of the hut was open, but so great was the terror which the man caused that it was midday before anyone would venture down to see what had become of him. </span>
<span sid='42994' title='42994'>Peeping into the open door, they saw a sight which sent them flying with white faces into the village. </span>
<span sid='42995' title='42995'>Within an hour I was on the spot, and had taken over the case.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42996' title='42996'>'Well, I have fairly steady nerves, as you know, Mr Holmes, but I give you my word that I got a shake when I put my head into that little house. </span>
<span sid='42997' title='42997'>It was droning like a harmonium with the flies and bluebottles, and the floor and walls were like a slaughter-house. </span>
<span sid='42998' title='42998'>He had called it a cabin, and a cabin it was, sure enough, for you would have thought that you were in a ship. </span>
<span sid='42999' title='42999'>There was a bunk at one end, a sea-chest, maps and charts, a picture of the Sea Unicorn, a line of log-books on a shelf, all exactly as one would expect to find it in a captain's room. </span>
<span sid='43000' title='43000'>And there in the middle of it was the man himself, his face twisted like a lost soul in hell, and his great brindled beard stuck upwards in his agony. </span>
<span sid='43001' title='43001'>Right through his broad breast a steel harpoon had been driven, and it had sunk deep into the wood of the wall behind him. </span>
<span sid='43002' title='43002'>He was pinned like a beetle on a card. </span>
<span sid='43003' title='43003'>Of course, he was quite dead, and had been so from the instant that he uttered that last yell of agony.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43004' title='43004'>'I know your methods, sir, and I applied them. </span>
<span sid='43005' title='43005'>Before I permitted anything to be moved I examined most carefully the ground outside, and also the floor of the room. </span>
<span sid='43006' title='43006'>There were no footmarks.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43007' title='43007'>'Meaning that you saw none?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43008' title='43008'>'I assure you, sir, that there were none.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43009' title='43009'>'My good Hopkins, I have investigated many crimes, but I have never yet seen one which was committed by a flying creature. </span>
<span sid='43010' title='43010'>As long as the criminal remains upon two legs so long must there be some indentation, some abrasion, some trifling displacement which can be detected by the scientific searcher. </span>
<span sid='43011' title='43011'>It is incredible that this blood-bespattered room contained no trace which could have aided us. </span>
<span sid='43012' title='43012'>I understand, however, from the inquest that there were some objects which you failed to overlook?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43013' title='43013'>The young inspector winced at my companion's ironical comments.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43014' title='43014'>'I was a fool not to call you in at the time, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='43015' title='43015'>However, that's past praying for now. </span>
<span sid='43016' title='43016'>Yes, there were several objects in the room which called for special attention. </span>
<span sid='43017' title='43017'>One was the harpoon with which the deed was committed. </span>
<span sid='43018' title='43018'>It had been snatched down from a rack on the wall. </span>
<span sid='43019' title='43019'>Two others remained there, and there was a vacant place for the third. </span>
<span sid='43020' title='43020'>On the stock was engraved "S.S. Sea Unicorn, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Dundee&t=h'>Dundee</a>". </span>
<span sid='43021' title='43021'>This seemed to establish that the crime had been done in a moment of fury, and that the murderer had seized the first weapon which came in his way. </span>
<span sid='43022' title='43022'>The fact that the crime was committed at two in the morning, and yet Peter Carey was fully dressed, suggested that he had an appointment with the murderer, which is borne out by the fact that a bottle of rum and two dirty glasses stood upon the table.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43023' title='43023'>'Yes,' said Holmes; 'I think that both inferences are permissible. </span>
<span sid='43024' title='43024'>Was there any other spirit but rum in the room?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43025' title='43025'>'Yes; there was a tantalus containing brandy and whisky on the sea-chest. </span>
<span sid='43026' title='43026'>It is of no importance to us, however, since the decanters were full and it had therefore not been used.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43027' title='43027'>'For all that its presence has some significance,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='43028' title='43028'>'However, let us hear some more about the objects which do seem to you to bear upon the case.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43029' title='43029'>'There was this tobacco-pouch upon the table.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43030' title='43030'>'What part of the table?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43031' title='43031'>'It lay in the middle. </span>
<span sid='43032' title='43032'>It was of coarse sealskin - the straight-haired skin, with a leather thong to bind it. </span>
<span sid='43033' title='43033'>Inside was "PC" on the flap. </span>
<span sid='43034' title='43034'>There was half an ounce of strong ship's tobacco in it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43035' title='43035'>'Excellent! </span>
<span sid='43036' title='43036'>What more?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43037' title='43037'>Stanley Hopkins drew from his pocket a drab-covered note-book. </span>
<span sid='43038' title='43038'>The outside was rough and worn, the leaves were discoloured. </span>
<span sid='43039' title='43039'>On the first page were written the initials 'JHN', and the date '1883'. </span>
<span sid='43040' title='43040'>Holmes laid it on the table and examined it in his minute way, while Hopkins and I gazed over each shoulder. </span>
<span sid='43041' title='43041'>On the second page were printed the letters 'CPR', and then came several sheets of numbers. </span>
<span sid='43042' title='43042'>Another heading was Argentine, another <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Costa Rica&t=h'>Costa Rica</a>, and another San Paulo, each with pages of signs and figures after it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43043' title='43043'>'What do you make of these?' asked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43044' title='43044'>'They appear to be lists of Stock Exchange securities. </span>
<span sid='43045' title='43045'>I thought that "JHN" were the initials of a broker, and that "CPR" may have been his client.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43046' title='43046'>'Try Canadian Pacific Railway,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43047' title='43047'>Stanley Hopkins swore between his teeth, and struck his thigh with his clenched hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43048' title='43048'>'What a fool I have been!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='43049' title='43049'>'Of course it is as you say. </span>
<span sid='43050' title='43050'>Then "JHN" are the only initials we have to solve. </span>
<span sid='43051' title='43051'>I have already examined the old Stock Exchange lists, and I can find no one in 1883 either in the House or among the outside brokers whose initials correspond with these. </span>
<span sid='43052' title='43052'>Yet I feel that the clue is the most important one that I hold. </span>
<span sid='43053' title='43053'>You will admit, Mr Holmes, that there is a possibility that these initials are those of the second person who was present - in other words, of the murderer. </span>
<span sid='43054' title='43054'>I would also urge that the introduction into the case of a document relating to large masses of valuable securities gives us for the first time some indication of a motive for the crime.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43055' title='43055'>Sherlock Holmes's face showed that he was thoroughly taken aback by this new development.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43056' title='43056'>'I must admit both your points,' said he. </span>
<span sid='43057' title='43057'>'I confess that this note-book, which did not appear at the inquest, modifies any views which I may have formed. </span>
<span sid='43058' title='43058'>I had come to a theory of the crime in which I can find no place for this. </span>
<span sid='43059' title='43059'>Have you endeavoured to trace any of the securities here mentioned?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43060' title='43060'>'Inquiries are now being made at the offices, but I fear that the complete register of the stock-holders of these South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n concerns is in South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>, and that some weeks must elapse before we can trace the shares.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43061' title='43061'>Holmes had been examining the cover of the note-book with his magnifying lens.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43062' title='43062'>'Surely there is some discoloration here,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43063' title='43063'>'Yes, sir, it is a blood-stain. </span>
<span sid='43064' title='43064'>I told you that I picked the book off the floor.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43065' title='43065'>'Was the blood-stain above or below?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43066' title='43066'>'On the side next to the boards.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43067' title='43067'>'Which proves, of course, that the book was dropped after the crime was committed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43068' title='43068'>'Exactly, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='43069' title='43069'>I appreciated that point, and I conjectured that it was dropped by the murderer on his hurried flight. </span>
<span sid='43070' title='43070'>It lay near the door.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43071' title='43071'>'I suppose that none of these securities have been found among the property of the dead man?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43072' title='43072'>'No, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43073' title='43073'>'Have you any reason to suspect robbery?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43074' title='43074'>'No, sir. </span>
<span sid='43075' title='43075'>Nothing seemed to have been touched.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43076' title='43076'>'Dear me, it is certainly a very interesting case. </span>
<span sid='43077' title='43077'>Then there was a knife, was there not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43078' title='43078'>'A sheath-knife, still in its sheath. </span>
<span sid='43079' title='43079'>It lay at the feet of the dead man. </span>
<span sid='43080' title='43080'>Mrs Carey has identified it as being her husband's property.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43081' title='43081'>Holmes was lost in thought for some time.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43082' title='43082'>'Well,' said he, at last, 'I suppose I shall have to come out and have a look at it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43083' title='43083'>Stanley Hopkins gave a cry of joy.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43084' title='43084'>'Thank you, sir. </span>
<span sid='43085' title='43085'>That will indeed be a weight off my mind.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43086' title='43086'>Holmes shook his finger at the inspector.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43087' title='43087'>'It would have been an easier task a week ago,' said he. </span>
<span sid='43088' title='43088'>'But even now my visit may not be entirely fruitless. </span>
<span sid='43089' title='43089'>Watson, if you can spare the time, I should be very glad of your company. </span>
<span sid='43090' title='43090'>If you will call a four-wheeler, Hopkins, we shall be ready to start for Forest Row in a quarter of an hour.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43091' title='43091'>Alighting at the small wayside station, we drove for some miles through the remains of widespread woods, which were once part of that great forest which for so long held the Saxon invaders at bay - the impenetrable 'weald', for sixty years the bulwark of Britain. </span>
<span sid='43092' title='43092'>Vast sections of it have been cleared, for this is the seat of the first ironworks of the country, and the trees have been felled to smelt the ore. </span>
<span sid='43093' title='43093'>Now the richer fields of the North have absorbed the trade, and nothing save these ravaged groves and great scars in the earth show the work of the past. </span>
<span sid='43094' title='43094'>Here in a clearing upon the green slope of a hill stood a long, low stone house, approached by a curving drive running through the fields. </span>
<span sid='43095' title='43095'>Nearer the road, and surrounded on three sides by bushes, was a small outhouse, one window and the door facing in our direction. </span>
<span sid='43096' title='43096'>It was the scene of the murder.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43097' title='43097'>Stanley Hopkins led us first to the house, where he introduced us to a haggard, grey-haired woman, the widow of the murdered man, whose gaunt and deep-lined face, with the furtive look of terror in the depths of her red- rimmed eyes, told of the years of hardship and ill-usage which she had endured. </span>
<span sid='43098' title='43098'>With her was her daughter, a pale, fair-haired girl, whose eyes blazed defiantly at us as she told us that she was glad that her father was dead, and that she blessed the hand which had struck him down. </span>
<span sid='43099' title='43099'>It was a terrible household that Black Peter Carey had made for himself, and it was with a sense of relief that we found ourselves in the sunlight again and making our way along the path which had been worn across the fields by the feet of the dead man.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43100' title='43100'>The outhouse was the simplest of dwellings, wooden- walled, single-roofed, one window beside the door, and one on the farther side. </span>
<span sid='43101' title='43101'>Stanley Hopkins drew the key from his pocket, and had stooped to the lock, when he paused with a look of attention and surprise upon his face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43102' title='43102'>'Someone has been tampering with it,' he said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43103' title='43103'>There could be no doubt of the fact. </span>
<span sid='43104' title='43104'>The woodwork was cut, and the scratches showed white through the paint, as if they had been that instant done. </span>
<span sid='43105' title='43105'>Holmes had been examining the window.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43106' title='43106'>'Someone has tried to force this also. </span>
<span sid='43107' title='43107'>Whoever it was has failed to make his way in. </span>
<span sid='43108' title='43108'>He must have been a very poor burglar.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43109' title='43109'>'This is a most extraordinary thing,' said the inspector; 'I could swear that these marks were not here yesterday evening.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43110' title='43110'>'Some curious person from the village, perhaps,' I suggested.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43111' title='43111'>'Very unlikely. </span>
<span sid='43112' title='43112'>Few of them would dare to set foot in the grounds, far less try to force their way into the cabin. </span>
<span sid='43113' title='43113'>What do you think of it, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43114' title='43114'>'I think that fortune is very kind to us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43115' title='43115'>'You mean that the person will come again?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43116' title='43116'>'It is very probable. </span>
<span sid='43117' title='43117'>He came expecting to find the door open. </span>
<span sid='43118' title='43118'>He tried to get in with the blade of a very small penknife. </span>
<span sid='43119' title='43119'>He could not manage it. </span>
<span sid='43120' title='43120'>What would he do?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43121' title='43121'>'Come again next night with a more useful tool.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43122' title='43122'>'So I should say. </span>
<span sid='43123' title='43123'>It will be our fault if we are not there to receive him. </span>
<span sid='43124' title='43124'>Meanwhile, let me see the inside of the cabin.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43125' title='43125'>The traces of the tragedy had been removed, but the furniture of the little room still stood as it had been on the night of the crime. </span>
<span sid='43126' title='43126'>For two hours, with the most intense concentration, Holmes examined every object in turn, but his face showed that his quest was not a successful one. </span>
<span sid='43127' title='43127'>Once only he paused in his patient investigation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43128' title='43128'>'Have you taken anything off this shelf, Hopkins?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43129' title='43129'>'No; I have moved nothing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43130' title='43130'>'Something has been taken. </span>
<span sid='43131' title='43131'>There is less dust in this comer of the shelf than elsewhere. </span>
<span sid='43132' title='43132'>It may have been a book lying on its side. </span>
<span sid='43133' title='43133'>It may have been a box. </span>
<span sid='43134' title='43134'>Well, well, I can do nothing more. </span>
<span sid='43135' title='43135'>Let us walk in these beautiful woods, Watson, and give a few hours to the birds and the flowers. </span>
<span sid='43136' title='43136'>We shall meet you here later, Hopkins, and see if we can come to closer quarters with the gentleman who has paid this visit in the night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43137' title='43137'>It was past eleven o'clock when we formed our little ambuscade. </span>
<span sid='43138' title='43138'>Hopkins was for leaving the door of the hut open, but Holmes was of the opinion that this would rouse the suspicions of the stranger. </span>
<span sid='43139' title='43139'>The lock was a perfectly simple one, and only a strong blade was needed to push it back. </span>
<span sid='43140' title='43140'>Holmes also suggested that we should wait, not inside the hut, but outside it among the bushes which grew round the farther window. </span>
<span sid='43141' title='43141'>In this way we should be able to watch our man if he struck a light, and see what his object was in this stealthy nocturnal visit.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43142' title='43142'>It was a long and melancholy vigil, and yet it brought with it something of the thrill which the hunter feels when he lies beside the water-pool and waits for the coming of the thirsty beast of prey. </span>
<span sid='43143' title='43143'>What savage creature was it which might steal upon us out of the darkness? </span>
<span sid='43144' title='43144'>Was it a fierce tiger of crime, which could only be taken fighting hard with flashing fang and claw, or would it prove to be some skulking jackal, dangerous only to the weak and unguarded? </span>
<span sid='43145' title='43145'>In absolute silence we crouched amongst the bushes, waiting for whatever might come. </span>
<span sid='43146' title='43146'>At first the steps of a few belated villagers, or the sound of voices from the village, lightened our vigil; but one by one these interruptions died away, and an absolute stillness fell upon us; save for the chimes of the distant church, which told us of the progress of the night, and for the rustle and whisper of a fine rain falling amid the foliage which roofed us in.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43147' title='43147'>Half-past two had chimed, and it was the darkest hour which precedes the dawn, when we ah l started as a low but sharp click came from the direction of the gate. </span>
<span sid='43148' title='43148'>Someone had entered the drive. </span>
<span sid='43149' title='43149'>Again there was a long silence, and I had begun to fear that it was a false alarm, when a stealthy step was heard upon the other side of the hut, and a moment later a metallic scraping and clicking. </span>
<span sid='43150' title='43150'>The man was trying to force the lock! </span>
<span sid='43151' title='43151'>This time his skill was greater or his tool was better, for there was a sudden snap and the creak of the hinges. </span>
<span sid='43152' title='43152'>Then a match was struck, and next instant the steady light from a candle filled the interior of the hut. </span>
<span sid='43153' title='43153'>Through the gauze curtain our eyes were all riveted upon the scene within.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43154' title='43154'>The nocturnal visitor was a young man, frail and thin, with a black moustache which intensified the deadly pallor of his face. </span>
<span sid='43155' title='43155'>He could not have been much above twenty years of age. </span>
<span sid='43156' title='43156'>I have never seen any human being who appeared to be in such a pitiable fright, for his teeth were visibly chattering, and he was shaking in every limb. </span>
<span sid='43157' title='43157'>He was dressed like a gentleman, in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norfolk&t=h'>Norfolk</a> jacket and knickerbockers, with a cloth cap upon his head. </span>
<span sid='43158' title='43158'>We watched him staring round with frightened eyes. </span>
<span sid='43159' title='43159'>Then he laid the candle-end upon the table and disappeared from our view into one of the corners. </span>
<span sid='43160' title='43160'>He returned with a large book, one of the log-books which formed a lime upon the shelves. </span>
<span sid='43161' title='43161'>Leaning on the table, he rapidly turned over the leaves of this volume until he came to the entry which he sought. </span>
<span sid='43162' title='43162'>Then, with an angry gesture of his clenched hand, he closed the book, replaced it in the comer, and put out the light. </span>
<span sid='43163' title='43163'>He had hardly turned to leave the hut when Hopkins's hand was on the fellow's collar, and I heard his loud gasp of terror as he understood that he was taken. </span>
<span sid='43164' title='43164'>The candle was re-lit, and there was our wretched captive shivering and cowering in the grasp of the detective. </span>
<span sid='43165' title='43165'>He sank down upon the sea-chest, and looked helplessly from one of us to the other.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43166' title='43166'>'Now, my fine fellow,' said Stanley Hopkins, 'who are you, and what do you want here?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43167' title='43167'>The man pulled himself together and faced us with an effort at self-composure.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43168' title='43168'>'You are detectives, I suppose?' said he. </span>
<span sid='43169' title='43169'>'You imagine I am connected with the death of Captain Peter Carey. </span>
<span sid='43170' title='43170'>I assure you that I am innocent.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43171' title='43171'>'We'll see about that,' said Hopkins. </span>
<span sid='43172' title='43172'>'First of ah, what is your name?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43173' title='43173'>'It is John Hopley Neligan.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43174' title='43174'>I saw Holmes and Hopkins exchange a quick glance. </span>
<span sid='43175' title='43175'>'What are you doing here?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43176' title='43176'>'Can I speak confidentially?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43177' title='43177'>'No, certainly not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43178' title='43178'>'Why should I tell you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43179' title='43179'>'If you have no answer it may go badly with you at the trial.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43180' title='43180'>The young man winced.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43181' title='43181'>'Well, I will tell you,' he said. </span>
<span sid='43182' title='43182'>'Why should I not? </span>
<span sid='43183' title='43183'>And yet I hate to think of this old scandal gaining a new lease of life. </span>
<span sid='43184' title='43184'>Did you ever hear of Dawson & Neligan?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43185' title='43185'>I could see from Hopkins's face that he never had; but Holmes was keenly interested.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43186' title='43186'>'You mean <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the West&t=h'>the West</a> Country bankers,' said he. </span>
<span sid='43187' title='43187'>They failed for a million, ruined half the county families of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Cornwall&t=h'>Cornwall</a>, and Neligan disappeared.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43188' title='43188'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='43189' title='43189'>Neligan was my father.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43190' title='43190'>At last we were getting something positive, and yet it seemed a long gap between an absconding banker and Captain Peter Carey pinned against the wall with one of his own harpoons. </span>
<span sid='43191' title='43191'>We all listened intently to the young man's words.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43192' title='43192'>'It was my father who was really concerned. </span>
<span sid='43193' title='43193'>Dawson had retired. </span>
<span sid='43194' title='43194'>I was only ten years of age at the time, but I was old enough to feel the shame and horror of it all. </span>
<span sid='43195' title='43195'>It has always been said that my father stole all the securities and fled. </span>
<span sid='43196' title='43196'>It is not true. </span>
<span sid='43197' title='43197'>It was his belief that if he were given time in which to realize them all would be well, and every creditor paid in full. </span>
<span sid='43198' title='43198'>He started in his little yacht for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norway&t=h'>Norway</a> just before the warrant was issued for his arrest. </span>
<span sid='43199' title='43199'>I can remember that last night when he bade farewell to my mother. </span>
<span sid='43200' title='43200'>He left us a list of the securities he was taking, and he swore that he would come back with his honour cleared, and that none who had trusted him would suffer. </span>
<span sid='43201' title='43201'>Well, no word was ever heard from him again. </span>
<span sid='43202' title='43202'>Both the yacht and he vanished utterly. </span>
<span sid='43203' title='43203'>We believed, my mother and I, that he and it, with the securities that he had taken with him, were at the bottom of the sea. </span>
<span sid='43204' title='43204'>We had a faithful friend, however, who is a business man, and it was he who discovered some time ago that some of the securities which my father had with him have reappeared on the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> market. </span>
<span sid='43205' title='43205'>You can imagine our amazement. </span>
<span sid='43206' title='43206'>I spent months in trying to trace them, and at last, after many doublings and difficulties, I discovered that the original seller had been Captain Peter Carey, the owner of this hut.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43207' title='43207'>'Naturally I made some inquiries about the man. </span>
<span sid='43208' title='43208'>I found that he had been in command of a whaler which was due to return from the Arctic seas at the very time when my father was crossing to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norway&t=h'>Norway</a>. </span>
<span sid='43209' title='43209'>The autumn of that year was a stormy one and there was a long succession of southerly gales. </span>
<span sid='43210' title='43210'>My father's yacht may well have been blown to the north, and there met by Captain Peter Carey's ship. </span>
<span sid='43211' title='43211'>If that were so, what had become of my father? </span>
<span sid='43212' title='43212'>In any case, if I could prove from Peter Carey's evidence how these securities came in the market, it would be a proof that my father had not sold them, and that he had no view to personal profit when he took them.</span>
<span sid='43213' title='43213'>'I came down to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sussex&t=h'>Sussex</a> with the intention of seeing the captain, but it was at this moment that his terrible death occurred. </span>
<span sid='43214' title='43214'>I read at the inquest a description of his cabin, in which it stated that the old log-books of his vessel were preserved in it. </span>
<span sid='43215' title='43215'>It struck me that if I could see what occurred in the month of August, 1883, on board the Sea Unicorn, I might settle the mystery of my father's fate. </span>
<span sid='43216' title='43216'>I tried last night to get at these log-books, but was unable to open the door. </span>
<span sid='43217' title='43217'>To-night I tried again, and succeeded; but I find that the pages which deal with that month have been torn from the book. </span>
<span sid='43218' title='43218'>It was at that moment I found myself a prisoner in your hands.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43219' title='43219'>'Is that all?' asked Hopkins.</span>
<span sid='43220' title='43220'>'Yes, that is ah.' </span>
<span sid='43221' title='43221'>His eyes shifted as he said it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43222' title='43222'>'You have nothing else to tell us?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43223' title='43223'>He hesitated.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43224' title='43224'>'No; there is nothing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43225' title='43225'>'You have not been here before last night?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43226' title='43226'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43227' title='43227'>'Then how do you account for that ?' cried Hopkins, as he held up the damning notebook, with the initials of our prisoner on the first leaf, and the blood-stain on the cover.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43228' title='43228'>The wretched man collapsed. </span>
<span sid='43229' title='43229'>He sank his face in his hands and trembled ah over.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43230' title='43230'>'Where did you get it?' he groaned. </span>
<span sid='43231' title='43231'>'I did not know. </span>
<span sid='43232' title='43232'>I thought I had lost it at the hotel.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43233' title='43233'>'That is enough,' said Hopkins sternly. </span>
<span sid='43234' title='43234'>'Whatever else you have to say you must say in court. </span>
<span sid='43235' title='43235'>You will walk down with me now to the police-station. </span>
<span sid='43236' title='43236'>Well, Mr Holmes, I am very much obliged to you and to your friend for coming down to help me. </span>
<span sid='43237' title='43237'>As it turns out your presence was unnecessary, and I would have brought the case to this successful issue without you; but none the less I am very grateful. </span>
<span sid='43238' title='43238'>Rooms have been reserved for you at the Brambletye Hotel, so we can ah walk down to the village together.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43239' title='43239'>'Well, Watson, what do you think of it?' asked Holmes as we travelled back next morning.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43240' title='43240'>'I can see that you are not satisfied.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43241' title='43241'>'Oh, yes, my dear Watson, I am perfectly satisfied. </span>
<span sid='43242' title='43242'>At the same time Stanley Hopkins's methods do not commend themselves to me. </span>
<span sid='43243' title='43243'>I am disappointed in Stanley Hopkins. </span>
<span sid='43244' title='43244'>I had hoped for better things from him. </span>
<span sid='43245' title='43245'>One should always look for a possible alternative and provide against it. </span>
<span sid='43246' title='43246'>It is the first rule of criminal investigation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43247' title='43247'>'What, then, is the alternative?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43248' title='43248'>'The fine of investigation which I have myself been pursuing. </span>
<span sid='43249' title='43249'>It may give nothing. </span>
<span sid='43250' title='43250'>I cannot tell. </span>
<span sid='43251' title='43251'>But at least I shall follow it to the end.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43252' title='43252'>Several letters were waiting for Holmes at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='43253' title='43253'>He snatched one of them up, opened it, and burst out into a triumphant chuckle of laughter.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43254' title='43254'>'Excellent, Watson. </span>
<span sid='43255' title='43255'>The alternative develops. </span>
<span sid='43256' title='43256'>Have you telegraph forms? </span>
<span sid='43257' title='43257'>Just write a couple of messages for me: "Sumner, Shipping Agent, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ratcliff Highway&t=h'>Ratcliff Highway</a>. </span>
<span sid='43258' title='43258'>Send three men on, to arrive ten to-morrow morning. </span>
<span sid='43259' title='43259'>- Basil." </span>
<span sid='43260' title='43260'>That's my name in those parts. </span>
<span sid='43261' title='43261'>The other is "Inspector Stanley Hopkins, 46, Lord Street, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a>. </span>
<span sid='43262' title='43262'>Come breakfast to-morrow at nine-thirty. </span>
<span sid='43263' title='43263'>Important. </span>
<span sid='43264' title='43264'>Wire if unable to come. </span>
<span sid='43265' title='43265'>- Sherlock Holmes." </span>
<span sid='43266' title='43266'>There, Watson, this infernal case has haunted me for ten days. </span>
<span sid='43267' title='43267'>I hereby banish it completely from my presence. </span>
<span sid='43268' title='43268'>To-morrow I trust that we shall hear the last of it for ever.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43269' title='43269'>Sharp at the hour named Inspector Stanley Hopkins appeared, and we sat down together to the excellent breakfast which Mrs Hudson had prepared. </span>
<span sid='43270' title='43270'>The young detective was in high spirits at his success.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43271' title='43271'>'You really think that your solution must be correct?' asked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43272' title='43272'>'I could not imagine a more complete case.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43273' title='43273'>'It did not seem to me conclusive.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43274' title='43274'>'You astonish me, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='43275' title='43275'>What more could one ask for?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43276' title='43276'>'Does your explanation cover every point?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43277' title='43277'>'Undoubtedly. </span>
<span sid='43278' title='43278'>I find that young Neligan arrived at the Brambletye Hotel on the very day of the crime. </span>
<span sid='43279' title='43279'>He came on the pretence of playing golf. </span>
<span sid='43280' title='43280'>His room was on the ground-floor, and he could get out when he liked. </span>
<span sid='43281' title='43281'>That very night he went down to Woodman's Lee, saw Peter Carey at the hut, quarrelled with him, and killed him with the harpoon.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43282' title='43282'>Then, horrified by what he had done, he fled out of the hut, dropping the note-book which he had brought with him in order to question Peter Carey about these different securities. </span>
<span sid='43283' title='43283'>You may have observed that some of them were marked with ticks, and the others - the great majority - were not. </span>
<span sid='43284' title='43284'>Those which are ticked have been traced on the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> market; but the others presumably were still in the possession of Carey, and young Neligan, according to his own account, was anxious to recover them in order to do the right thing by his father's creditors. </span>
<span sid='43285' title='43285'>After his flight he did not dare to approach the hut again for some time; but at last he forced himself to do so in order to obtain the information which he needed. </span>
<span sid='43286' title='43286'>Surely that is all simple and obvious?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43287' title='43287'>Holmes smiled and shook his head.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43288' title='43288'>'It seems to me to have only one drawback, Hopkins, and that is that it is intrinsically impossible. </span>
<span sid='43289' title='43289'>Have you tried to drive a harpoon through a body? </span>
<span sid='43290' title='43290'>No? </span>
<span sid='43291' title='43291'>Tut, tut, my dear sir, you must really pay attention to these details. </span>
<span sid='43292' title='43292'>My friend Watson could tell you that I spent a whole morning in that exercise. </span>
<span sid='43293' title='43293'>It is no easy matter, and requires a strong and practised arm. </span>
<span sid='43294' title='43294'>But this blow was delivered with such violence that the head of the weapon sank deep into the wall. </span>
<span sid='43295' title='43295'>Do you imagine that this anaemic youth was capable of so frightful an assault? </span>
<span sid='43296' title='43296'>Is he the man who hob-nobbed in rum and water with Black Peter in the dead of the night? </span>
<span sid='43297' title='43297'>Was it his profile that was seen on the blind two nights before? </span>
<span sid='43298' title='43298'>No, no, Hopkins; it is another and a more formidable person for whom we must seek.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43299' title='43299'>The detective's face had grown longer and longer during Holmes's speech. </span>
<span sid='43300' title='43300'>His hopes and his ambitions were all crumbling about him. </span>
<span sid='43301' title='43301'>But he would not abandon his position without a struggle.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43302' title='43302'>'You can't deny that Neligan was present that night, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='43303' title='43303'>The book will prove that. </span>
<span sid='43304' title='43304'>I fancy that I have evidence enough to satisfy a jury, even if you are able to pick a hole in it. </span>
<span sid='43305' title='43305'>Besides, Mr Holmes, I have laid my hand upon my man. </span>
<span sid='43306' title='43306'>As to this terrible person of yours, where is he?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43307' title='43307'>'I rather fancy that he is on the stair,' said Holmes, serenely. </span>
<span sid='43308' title='43308'>'I think, Watson, that you would do well to put that revolver where you can reach it.' </span>
<span sid='43309' title='43309'>He rose, and laid a written paper upon a side-table. </span>
<span sid='43310' title='43310'>'Now we are ready,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43311' title='43311'>There had been some talking in gruff voices outside, and now Mrs Hudson opened the door to say that there were three men inquiring for Captain Basil.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43312' title='43312'>'Show them in one by one,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43313' title='43313'>The first who entered was a little ribston-pippin of a man, with ruddy cheeks and fluffy white side-whiskers. </span>
<span sid='43314' title='43314'>Holmes had drawn a letter from his pocket.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43315' title='43315'>'What name?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43316' title='43316'>'James Lancaster.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43317' title='43317'>'I am sorry, Lancaster, but the berth is full. </span>
<span sid='43318' title='43318'>Here is half a sovereign for your trouble. </span>
<span sid='43319' title='43319'>Just step into this room and wait there for a few minutes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43320' title='43320'>The second man was a long, dried-up creature, with lank hair and sallow cheeks. </span>
<span sid='43321' title='43321'>His name was Hugh Pattins. </span>
<span sid='43322' title='43322'>He also received his dismissal, his half-sovereign, and the order to wait.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43323' title='43323'>The third applicant was a man of remarkable appearance. </span>
<span sid='43324' title='43324'>A fierce, bull-dog face was framed in a tangle of hair and beard, and two bold dark eyes gleamed behind the cover of thick, tufted, overhung eyebrows. </span>
<span sid='43325' title='43325'>He saluted and stood sailor-fashion, turning his cap round in his hands.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43326' title='43326'>'Your name?' asked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43327' title='43327'>'Patrick Cairns.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43328' title='43328'>'Harpooner?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43329' title='43329'>'Yes, sir. </span>
<span sid='43330' title='43330'>Twenty-six voyages.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43331' title='43331'>'<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Dundee&t=h'>Dundee</a>, I suppose?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43332' title='43332'>'Yes, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43333' title='43333'>'And ready to start with an exploring ship?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43334' title='43334'>'Yes, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43335' title='43335'>'What wages?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43336' title='43336'>'Eight pounds a month!</span>
<p>
<span sid='43337' title='43337'>'Could you start at once?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43338' title='43338'>'As soon as I get my kit.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43339' title='43339'>'Have you your papers?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43340' title='43340'>'Yes, sir.' </span>
<span sid='43341' title='43341'>He took a sheaf of worn and greasy forms from his pocket. </span>
<span sid='43342' title='43342'>Holmes glanced over them and returned them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43343' title='43343'>'You are just the man I want,' said he. </span>
<span sid='43344' title='43344'>'Here's the agreement on the side-table. </span>
<span sid='43345' title='43345'>If you sign it the whole matter will be settled.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43346' title='43346'>The seaman lurched across the room and took up the pen. </span>
<span sid='43347' title='43347'>'Shall I sign here?' he asked, stooping over the table. </span>
<span sid='43348' title='43348'>Holmes leaned over his shoulder and passed both hands over his neck.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43349' title='43349'>'This will do,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43350' title='43350'>I heard a click of steel and a bellow like an enraged bull. </span>
<span sid='43351' title='43351'>The next instant Holmes and the seaman were rolling on the ground together. </span>
<span sid='43352' title='43352'>He was a man of such gigantic strength that, even with the handcuffs which Holmes had so deftly fastened upon his wrist, he would have quickly overpowered my friend had Hopkins and I not rushed to his rescue. </span>
<span sid='43353' title='43353'>Only when I pressed the cold muzzle of the revolver to his temple did he at last understand that resistance was vain. </span>
<span sid='43354' title='43354'>We lashed his ankles with cord and rose breathless from the struggle.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43355' title='43355'>'I must really apologize, Hopkins,' said Sherlock Holmes; 'I fear that the scrambled eggs are cold. </span>
<span sid='43356' title='43356'>However, you will enjoy the rest of your breakfast all the better, will you not, for the thought that you have brought your case to a triumphant conclusion?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43357' title='43357'>Stanley Hopkins was speechless with amazement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43358' title='43358'>'I don't know what to say, Mr Holmes,' he blurted out at last, with a very red face. </span>
<span sid='43359' title='43359'>seems to me that I have been making a fool of myself from the beginning. </span>
<span sid='43360' title='43360'>I understand now, what should never have forgotten, that I am the pupil and you are the master. </span>
<span sid='43361' title='43361'>Even now I see what you have done, but I don't know how you did it, or what it signifies.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43362' title='43362'>'Well, well,' said Holmes good-humouredly. </span>
<span sid='43363' title='43363'>'We ah l learn by experience, and your lesson this time is that you should never lose sight of the alternative. </span>
<span sid='43364' title='43364'>You were so absorbed in young Neligan that you could not spare a thought to Patrick Cairns, the true murderer of Peter Carey.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43365' title='43365'>The hoarse voice of the seaman broke in on our conversation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43366' title='43366'>'See here, mister,' said he, 'I make no complaint of being man-handled in this fashion, but I would have you call things by their right names. </span>
<span sid='43367' title='43367'>You say I murdered Peter Carey; I say I killed Peter Carey, and there's all the difference. </span>
<span sid='43368' title='43368'>Maybe you don't believe what I say. </span>
<span sid='43369' title='43369'>Maybe you think I am just slinging you a yarn.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43370' title='43370'>'Not at all,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='43371' title='43371'>'Let us hear what you have to say.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43372' title='43372'>'It's soon told, and, by the Lord, every word of it is truth. </span>
<span sid='43373' title='43373'>I knew Black Peter, and when he pulled out his knife I whipped a harpoon through him sharp, for I knew that it was him or me. </span>
<span sid='43374' title='43374'>That's how he died. </span>
<span sid='43375' title='43375'>You can call it murder. </span>
<span sid='43376' title='43376'>Anyhow, I'd as soon die with a rope round my neck as with Black Peter's knife in my heart.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43377' title='43377'>'How came you there?' asked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43378' title='43378'>'I'll tell it you from the beginning. </span>
<span sid='43379' title='43379'>Just sit me up a little so I can speak easy. </span>
<span sid='43380' title='43380'>It was in '83 that it happened - August of that year. </span>
<span sid='43381' title='43381'>Peter Carey was master of the Sea Unicorn, and I was spare harpooner. </span>
<span sid='43382' title='43382'>We were coming out of the ice-pack on our way home, with head winds and a week's southerly gale, when we picked up a little craft that had been blown north. </span>
<span sid='43383' title='43383'>There was one man on her - a landsman. </span>
<span sid='43384' title='43384'>The crew had thought she would founder, and had made for the Norwegian coast in the dinghy. </span>
<span sid='43385' title='43385'>I guess they were all drowned. </span>
<span sid='43386' title='43386'>Well, we took him on board, this man, and he and the skipper had some long talks in the cabin. </span>
<span sid='43387' title='43387'>All the baggage we took off with him was one tin box. </span>
<span sid='43388' title='43388'>So far as I know the man's name was never mentioned, and on the second night he disappeared as if he had never been. </span>
<span sid='43389' title='43389'>It was given out that he had either thrown himself overboard or fallen overboard in the heavy weather that we were having. </span>
<span sid='43390' title='43390'>Only one man knew what had happened to him, and that was me, for with my own eyes I saw the skipper tip up his heels and put him over the rail in the middle watch of a dark night, two days before we sighted the Shetland lights.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43391' title='43391'>'Well, I kept my knowledge to myself and waited to see what would come of it. </span>
<span sid='43392' title='43392'>When we got back to Scotland it was easily hushed up, and nobody asked any questions. </span>
<span sid='43393' title='43393'>A stranger died by an accident, and it was nobody's business to inquire. </span>
<span sid='43394' title='43394'>Shortly after Peter Carey gave up the sea, and it was long years before I could find where he was. </span>
<span sid='43395' title='43395'>I guessed that he had done the deed for the sake of what was in that tin box, and that he could afford now to pay me well for keeping my mouth shut.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43396' title='43396'>'I found out where he was through a sailor man that had met him in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, and down I went to squeeze him. </span>
<span sid='43397' title='43397'>The first night he was reasonable enough, and was ready to give me what would make me free of the sea for life. </span>
<span sid='43398' title='43398'>We were to fix it all two nights later. </span>
<span sid='43399' title='43399'>When I came I found him three-parts drunk and full of the devil. </span>
<span sid='43400' title='43400'>We sat down and we drank and we yarned about old times, but the more he drank the less I liked the look on his face. </span>
<span sid='43401' title='43401'>I spotted that harpoon upon the wall, and I thought I might need it before I was through. </span>
<span sid='43402' title='43402'>Then at last he broke out at me spitting and cursing, with murder in his eyes and a great clasp-knife in his hand. </span>
<span sid='43403' title='43403'>He had not time to get it from the sheath before I had the harpoon through him. </span>
<span sid='43404' title='43404'>My God! what a yell he gave; and his face gets between me and my sleep! </span>
<span sid='43405' title='43405'>I stood there, with his blood splashing round me, and I waited for a bit; but all was quiet, so I took heart once more. </span>
<span sid='43406' title='43406'>I looked round, and there was the tin box on a shelf. </span>
<span sid='43407' title='43407'>I had as much right to it as Peter Carey, anyhow, so I took it with me and left the hut. </span>
<span sid='43408' title='43408'>Like a fool I left my baccy-pouch upon the table.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43409' title='43409'>'Now tell you the queerest pan of the whole story. </span>
<span sid='43410' title='43410'>I had hardly got outside the hut when I heard someone coming, and I hid among the bushes. </span>
<span sid='43411' title='43411'>A man came slinking along, went into the hut, gave a cry as if he had seen a ghost, and legged it as hard as he could run until he was out of sight. </span>
<span sid='43412' title='43412'>Who he was or what he wanted is more than I can tell. </span>
<span sid='43413' title='43413'>For my pan, I walked ten miles, got a train at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Tunbridge Wells&t=h'>Tunbridge Wells</a>, and so reached <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, and no one the wiser.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43414' title='43414'>'Well, when I came to examine the box I found there was no money in it, and nothing but papers that I would not dare to sell. </span>
<span sid='43415' title='43415'>I had lost my hold on Black Peter, and was stranded in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> without a shilling. </span>
<span sid='43416' title='43416'>There was only my trade left. </span>
<span sid='43417' title='43417'>I saw these advertisements about harpooners and high wages, so I went to the shipping agents, and they sent me here. </span>
<span sid='43418' title='43418'>That's all I know, and I say again that if I killed Black Peter, the law should give me thanks, for I saved them the price of a hempen rope.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43419' title='43419'>'A very clear statement,' said Holmes, rising and fighting his pipe. </span>
<span sid='43420' title='43420'>'I think, Hopkins, that you should lose no time in conveying your prisoner to a place of safety. </span>
<span sid='43421' title='43421'>This room is not well adapted for a cell, and Mr Patrick Cairns occupies too large a portion of our carpet.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43422' title='43422'>'Mr Holmes,' said Hopkins, 'I do not know how to express my gratitude. </span>
<span sid='43423' title='43423'>Even now I do not understand how you attained this result.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43424' title='43424'>Simply by having the good fortune to get the right clue from the beginning. </span>
<span sid='43425' title='43425'>It is very possible that if I had known about this note-book it might have led away my thoughts, as it did yours. </span>
<span sid='43426' title='43426'>But all I heard pointed in the one direction. </span>
<span sid='43427' title='43427'>The amazing strength, the skill in the use of the harpoon, the rum and water, the seal-skin tobacco-pouch, with the coarse tobacco - all these pointed to a seaman, and one who had been a whaler. </span>
<span sid='43428' title='43428'>I was convinced that the initials "PC" upon the pouch were a coincidence, and not those of Peter Carey, since he seldom smoked, and no pipe was found in his cabin. </span>
<span sid='43429' title='43429'>You remember that I asked whether whisky and brandy were in the cabin. </span>
<span sid='43430' title='43430'>You said they were. </span>
<span sid='43431' title='43431'>How many landsmen are there who would drink rum when they could get these other spirits? </span>
<span sid='43432' title='43432'>Yes, I was certain it was a seaman.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43433' title='43433'>'And how did you find him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43434' title='43434'>'My dear sir, the problem had become a very simple one. </span>
<span sid='43435' title='43435'>If it were a seaman, it could only be a seaman who had been with him on the Sea Unicorn. </span>
<span sid='43436' title='43436'>So far as I could learn, he had sailed in no other ship. </span>
<span sid='43437' title='43437'>I spent three days in wiring to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Dundee&t=h'>Dundee</a>, and at the end of that time I had ascertained the names of the crew of the Sea Unicorn in 1883. </span>
<span sid='43438' title='43438'>When I found Patrick Cairns among the harpooners my research was nearing its end. </span>
<span sid='43439' title='43439'>I argued that the man was probably in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, and that he would desire to leave the country for a time. </span>
<span sid='43440' title='43440'>I therefore spent some days in the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=East End&t=h'>East End</a>, devised an Arctic expedition, put forward tempting terms for harpooners who would serve under Captain Basil - and behold the result!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43441' title='43441'>'Wonderful!' cried Hopkins. </span>
<span sid='43442' title='43442'>'Wonderful!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43443' title='43443'>'You must obtain the release of young Neligan as soon as possible.' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='43444' title='43444'>'I confess that I think you owe him some apology. </span>
