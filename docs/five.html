<h1><span sid='20756' title='20756'>The Five Orange Pips</span></h1>
<p class="subtitle">Arthur Conan Doyle<label for="sn-meta-five" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-meta-five" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><!--googleoff: all--><b>Story Number</b>: 7<br><b>Published in</b>: The Strand Magazine in November 1891<br><b>Collected in</b>: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes<!--googleon: all--></span></p>
<p>
<span sid='20757' title='20757'>When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases between the years '82 and '90, I am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features, that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave. </span>
<span sid='20758' title='20758'>Some, however, have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. </span>
<span sid='20759' title='20759'>Some, too, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings, without an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him. </span>
<span sid='20760' title='20760'>There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results, that I am tempted to give some account of it, in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been, and probably never will be, entirely cleared up.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20761' title='20761'>The year '87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest, of which I retain the records. </span>
<span sid='20762' title='20762'>Among my headings under this one twelve months, I find an account of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the British barque Sophy Anderson, of the singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Camberwell&t=h'>Camberwell</a> poisoning case. </span>
<span sid='20763' title='20763'>In the latter, as may be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man's watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours ago, and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time - a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. </span>
<span sid='20764' title='20764'>All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20765' title='20765'>It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence. </span>
<span sid='20766' title='20766'>All day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of great, hand-made <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life, and to recognize the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilization, like untamed beasts in a cage. </span>
<span sid='20767' title='20767'>As evening drew in the storm grew louder and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney. </span>
<span sid='20768' title='20768'>Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, whilst I at the other was deep in one of Clark Russell's fine sea stories, until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. </span>
<span sid='20769' title='20769'>My wife was on a visit to her aunt's, and for a few days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20770' title='20770'>'Why,' said I, glancing up at my companion, 'that was surely the bell? </span>
<span sid='20771' title='20771'>Who could come tonight? </span>
<span sid='20772' title='20772'>Some friend of yours, perhaps?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20773' title='20773'>'Except yourself I have none,' he answered. </span>
<span sid='20774' title='20774'>'I do not encourage visitors.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20775' title='20775'>'A client, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20776' title='20776'>'If so, it is a serious case. </span>
<span sid='20777' title='20777'>Nothing less would bring a man out on such a day, and at such an hour. </span>
<span sid='20778' title='20778'>But I take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landlady's.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20779' title='20779'>Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a step in the passage, and a tapping at the door. </span>
<span sid='20780' title='20780'>He stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit. </span>
<span sid='20781' title='20781'>'Come in!' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20782' title='20782'>The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside, well groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing. </span>
<span sid='20783' title='20783'>The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come. </span>
<span sid='20784' title='20784'>He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20785' title='20785'>'I owe you an apology,' he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his eyes. </span>
<span sid='20786' title='20786'>'I trust that I am not intruding. </span>
<span sid='20787' title='20787'>I fear that I have brought some traces of the storm and the rain into your snug chamber.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20788' title='20788'>'Give me your coat and umbrella,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='20789' title='20789'>'They may rest here on the hook, and will be dry presently. </span>
<span sid='20790' title='20790'>You have come up from the south-west, I see.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20791' title='20791'>'Yes, from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Horsham&t=h'>Horsham</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20792' title='20792'>'That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe-caps is quite distinctive:</span>
<p>
<span sid='20793' title='20793'>'I have come for advice.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20794' title='20794'>'That is easily got.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20795' title='20795'>'And help.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20796' title='20796'>'That is not always so easy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20797' title='20797'>'I have heard of you, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='20798' title='20798'>I heard from Major Prendergast how you saved him in the Tankerville Club Scandal.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20799' title='20799'>'Ah, of course. </span>
<span sid='20800' title='20800'>He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20801' title='20801'>'He said that you could solve anything.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20802' title='20802'>'He said too much.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20803' title='20803'>'That you are never beaten.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20804' title='20804'>'I have been beaten four times - three times by men and once by a woman.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20805' title='20805'>'But what is that compared with the number of your successes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20806' title='20806'>'It is true that I have been generally successful.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20807' title='20807'>'Then you may be so with me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20808' title='20808'>'I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire, and favour me with some details as to your case.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20809' title='20809'>'It is no ordinary one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20810' title='20810'>'None of those which come to me are. </span>
<span sid='20811' title='20811'>I am the last court of appeal.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20812' title='20812'>'And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20813' title='20813'>'You fill me with interest,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='20814' title='20814'>'Pray give us the essential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20815' title='20815'>The young man pulled his chair up, and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20816' title='20816'>'My name,' said he, 'is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have, so far as I can understand it, little to do with this awful business. </span>
<span sid='20817' title='20817'>It is a hereditary matter, so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the affair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20818' title='20818'>'You must know that my grandfather had two sons - my uncle Elias and my father Joseph. </span>
<span sid='20819' title='20819'>My father had a small factory at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Coventry&t=h'>Coventry</a>, which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. </span>
<span sid='20820' title='20820'>He was the patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tyre, and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it, and to retire upon a handsome competence.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20821' title='20821'>'My uncle Elias emigrated to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a> when he was a young man, and became a planter in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Florida&t=h'>Florida</a>, where he was reported to have done very well. </span>
<span sid='20822' title='20822'>At the time of the war he fought in Jackson's army, and afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. </span>
<span sid='20823' title='20823'>When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four years. </span>
<span sid='20824' title='20824'>About 1869 or 1870 he came back to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>, and took a small estate in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sussex&t=h'>Sussex</a>, near <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Horsham&t=h'>Horsham</a>. </span>
<span sid='20825' title='20825'>He had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to them. </span>
<span sid='20826' title='20826'>He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring disposition. </span>
<span sid='20827' title='20827'>During all the years that he lived at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Horsham&t=h'>Horsham</a> I doubt if ever he set foot in the town. </span>
<span sid='20828' title='20828'>He had a garden and two or three fields round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. </span>
<span sid='20829' title='20829'>He drank a great deal of brandy, and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society, and did not want any friends, not even his own brother.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20830' title='20830'>'He didn't mind me, in fact he took a fancy to me, for at the time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. </span>
<span sid='20831' title='20831'>That would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>. </span>
<span sid='20832' title='20832'>He begged my father to let me live with him, and he was very kind to me in his way. </span>
<span sid='20833' title='20833'>When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the house. </span>
<span sid='20834' title='20834'>I kept all the keys, and could go where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy. </span>
<span sid='20835' title='20835'>There was one singular exception, however, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter. </span>
<span sid='20836' title='20836'>With a boy's curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20837' title='20837'>'One day - it was in March, 1883 - a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the Colonel's plate. </span>
<span sid='20838' title='20838'>It was not a common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. </span>
<span sid='20839' title='20839'>"From India!" said he, as he took it up, "<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pondicherry&t=h'>Pondicherry</a> post-mark! </span>
<span sid='20840' title='20840'>What can this be?" </span>
<span sid='20841' title='20841'>Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. </span>
<span sid='20842' title='20842'>I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face. </span>
<span sid='20843' title='20843'>His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand. </span>
<span sid='20844' title='20844'>"K. K. K.," he shrieked, and then: "My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me."</span>
<p>
<span sid='20845' title='20845'>'"What is it, uncle!" I cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20846' title='20846'>'"Death," said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room, leaving me palpitating with horror. </span>
<span sid='20847' title='20847'>I took up the envelope, and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter K three times repeated. </span>
<span sid='20848' title='20848'>There was nothing else save the five dried pips. </span>
<span sid='20849' title='20849'>What could be the reason of his overpowering terror? </span>
<span sid='20850' title='20850'>I left the breakfast-table, and as I ascended the stairs I met him coming down with an old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box, like a cash box, in the other.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20851' title='20851'>'"They may do what they like, but I'll checkmate them still," said he, with an oath. </span>
<span sid='20852' title='20852'>"Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room today, and send down to Fordham, the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Horsham&t=h'>Horsham</a> lawyer."</span>
<p>
<span sid='20853' title='20853'>'I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step up to the room. </span>
<span sid='20854' title='20854'>The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. </span>
<span sid='20855' title='20855'>As I glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid were printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the envelope.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20856' title='20856'>'"I wish you, John," said my uncle, "to witness my will. </span>
<span sid='20857' title='20857'>I leave my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages to my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. </span>
<span sid='20858' title='20858'>If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! </span>
<span sid='20859' title='20859'>If you find you cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. </span>
<span sid='20860' title='20860'>I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can't say what turn things are going to take. </span>
<span sid='20861' title='20861'>Kindly sign the paper where Mr Fordham shows you."</span>
<p>
<span sid='20862' title='20862'>'I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him. </span>
<span sid='20863' title='20863'>The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression upon me, and I pondered over it, and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it. </span>
<span sid='20864' title='20864'>Yet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind it, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed, and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. </span>
<span sid='20865' title='20865'>I could see a change in my uncle, however. </span>
<span sid='20866' title='20866'>He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of society. </span>
<span sid='20867' title='20867'>Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil. </span>
<span sid='20868' title='20868'>When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush tumultuously in at the door, and lock and bar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul. </span>
<span sid='20869' title='20869'>At such times I have seen his face even on a cold day, glisten with moisture as though it were new raised from a basin.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20870' title='20870'>'Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr Holmes, and not to abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back. </span>
<span sid='20871' title='20871'>We found him, when we went to search for him, face downwards in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. </span>
<span sid='20872' title='20872'>There was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of suicide. </span>
<span sid='20873' title='20873'>But I, who knew how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. </span>
<span sid='20874' title='20874'>The matter passed, however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of some fourteen thousand pounds, which lay to his credit at the bank.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20875' title='20875'>'One moment,' Holmes interposed. </span>
<span sid='20876' title='20876'>'Your statement is, I foresee, one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. </span>
<span sid='20877' title='20877'>Let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his supposed suicide.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20878' title='20878'>'The letter arrived on March the 10th, 1883. </span>
<span sid='20879' title='20879'>His death was seven weeks later, upon the night of the 2nd of May.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20880' title='20880'>'Thank you. </span>
<span sid='20881' title='20881'>Pray proceed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20882' title='20882'>'When my father took over the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Horsham&t=h'>Horsham</a> property, he, at my request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. </span>
<span sid='20883' title='20883'>We found the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. </span>
<span sid='20884' title='20884'>On the inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials K. K. K. repeated upon it, and "Letters, memoranda, receipts and a register" written beneath. </span>
<span sid='20885' title='20885'>These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. </span>
<span sid='20886' title='20886'>For the rest, there was nothing of much importance in the attic, save a great many scattered papers and notebooks bearing upon my uncle's life in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>. </span>
<span sid='20887' title='20887'>Some of them were of the war time, and showed that he had done his duty well, and had borne the repute of being a brave soldier. </span>
<span sid='20888' title='20888'>Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern States, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the North.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20889' title='20889'>'Well, it was the beginning of '84, when my father came to live at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Horsham&t=h'>Horsham</a>, and all went as well as possible with us until the January of '85. </span>
<span sid='20890' title='20890'>On the fourth day after the New Year I heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. </span>
<span sid='20891' title='20891'>There he was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the out-stretched palm of the other one. </span>
<span sid='20892' title='20892'>He had always laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the Colonel, but he looked very puzzled and scared now that the same thing had come upon himself.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20893' title='20893'>'"Why, what on earth does this mean, John?" he stammered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20894' title='20894'>'My heart had turned to lead. </span>
<span sid='20895' title='20895'>"It is K. K. K.," said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20896' title='20896'>'He looked inside the envelope. </span>
<span sid='20897' title='20897'>"So it is," he cried. </span>
<span sid='20898' title='20898'>"Here are the very letters. </span>
<span sid='20899' title='20899'>But what is this written above them?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='20900' title='20900'>'"Put the papers on the sun-dial," I read, peeping over his shoulder.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20901' title='20901'>'"What papers? </span>
<span sid='20902' title='20902'>What sun-dial?" he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20903' title='20903'>'"The sun-dial in the garden. </span>
<span sid='20904' title='20904'>There is no other," said I; "but the papers must be those that are destroyed."</span>
<p>
<span sid='20905' title='20905'>'"Pooh!" said he, gripping hard at his courage.' </span>
<span sid='20906' title='20906'>"We are in a civilized land here, and we can't have tomfoolery of this kind. </span>
<span sid='20907' title='20907'>Where does the thing come from?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='20908' title='20908'>'"From <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Dundee&t=h'>Dundee</a>," I answered, glancing at the postmark.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20909' title='20909'>'"Some preposterous practical joke," said he. </span>
<span sid='20910' title='20910'>"What have I to do with sun-dials and papers? </span>
<span sid='20911' title='20911'>I shall take no notice of such nonsense."</span>
<p>
<span sid='20912' title='20912'>'"I should certainly speak to the police," I said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20913' title='20913'>'"And be laughed at for my pains. </span>
<span sid='20914' title='20914'>Nothing of the sort." </span>
<span sid='20915' title='20915'>'"Then let me do so."</span>
<p>
<span sid='20916' title='20916'>'"No, I forbid you. </span>
<span sid='20917' title='20917'>I won't have a fuss made over such nonsense."</span>
<p>
<span sid='20918' title='20918'>'It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. </span>
<span sid='20919' title='20919'>I went about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20920' title='20920'>'On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command of one of the forts upon <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Portsdown Hill&t=h'>Portsdown Hill</a>. </span>
<span sid='20921' title='20921'>I was glad that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was further from danger when he was away from home. </span>
<span sid='20922' title='20922'>In that, however, I was in error. </span>
<span sid='20923' title='20923'>Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram from the Major, imploring me to come at once. </span>
<span sid='20924' title='20924'>My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. </span>
<span sid='20925' title='20925'>I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness. </span>
<span sid='20926' title='20926'>He had, as it appears, been returning from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Fareham&t=h'>Fareham</a> in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of "Death from accidental causes". </span>
<span sid='20927' title='20927'>Carefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder. </span>
<span sid='20928' title='20928'>There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. </span>
<span sid='20929' title='20929'>And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20930' title='20930'>'In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. </span>
<span sid='20931' title='20931'>You will ask me why I did not dispose of it? </span>
<span sid='20932' title='20932'>I answer because I was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle's life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20933' title='20933'>'It was in January, '85, that my poor father met his end, and two years and eight months have elapsed since then. </span>
<span sid='20934' title='20934'>During that time I have lived happily at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Horsham&t=h'>Horsham</a>, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. </span>
<span sid='20935' title='20935'>I had begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20936' title='20936'>The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and, turning to the table, he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20937' title='20937'>'This is the envelope,' he continued. </span>
<span sid='20938' title='20938'>'The postmark is <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> - eastern division. </span>
<span sid='20939' title='20939'>Within are the very words which were upon my father's last message. </span>
<span sid='20940' title='20940'>"K. K. K."; and then "Put the papers on the sundial".'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20941' title='20941'>'What have you done?' asked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20942' title='20942'>'Nothing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20943' title='20943'>'Nothing?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20944' title='20944'>'To tell the truth' - he sank his face into his thin, white hands - 'I have felt helpless. </span>
<span sid='20945' title='20945'>I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. </span>
<span sid='20946' title='20946'>I seem to be in the grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can guard against.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20947' title='20947'>'Tut! </span>
<span sid='20948' title='20948'>Tut!' cried Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='20949' title='20949'>'You must act, man, or you are lost. </span>
<span sid='20950' title='20950'>Nothing but energy can save you. </span>
<span sid='20951' title='20951'>This is no time for despair.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20952' title='20952'>'I have seen the police.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20953' title='20953'>'Ah?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20954' title='20954'>'But they listened to my story with a smile. </span>
<span sid='20955' title='20955'>I am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20956' title='20956'>Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air. </span>
<span sid='20957' title='20957'>'Incredible imbecility!' he cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20958' title='20958'>'They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the house with me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20959' title='20959'>'Has he come with you to-night?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20960' title='20960'>'No. </span>
<span sid='20961' title='20961'>His orders were to stay in the house.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20962' title='20962'>Again Holmes raved in the air.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20963' title='20963'>'Why did you come to me?' he said; 'and, above all, why did you not come at once?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20964' title='20964'>'I did not know. </span>
<span sid='20965' title='20965'>It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast about my trouble, and was advised by him to come to you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20966' title='20966'>'It is really two days since you had the letter. </span>
<span sid='20967' title='20967'>We should have acted before this. </span>
<span sid='20968' title='20968'>You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which you have placed before us - no suggestive detail which might help us?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20969' title='20969'>'There is one thing,' said John Openshaw. </span>
<span sid='20970' title='20970'>He rummaged in his coat pocket, and drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he laid it out upon the table. </span>
<span sid='20971' title='20971'>'I have some remembrance,' said he, 'that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour. </span>
<span sid='20972' title='20972'>I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which had, perhaps, fluttered out from among the others, and in that way escaped destruction. </span>
<span sid='20973' title='20973'>Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. </span>
<span sid='20974' title='20974'>I think myself that it is a page from some private diary. </span>
<span sid='20975' title='20975'>The writing is undoubtedly my uncle's.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20976' title='20976'>Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. </span>
<span sid='20977' title='20977'>It was headed 'March, 1869', and beneath were the following enigmatical notices:</span>
<p>
<span sid='20978' title='20978'>4th. </span>
<span sid='20979' title='20979'>Hudson came. </span>
<span sid='20980' title='20980'>Same old platform.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20981' title='20981'>7th. </span>
<span sid='20982' title='20982'>Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and John Swain of St Augustine.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20983' title='20983'>9th. </span>
<span sid='20984' title='20984'>McCauley cleared.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20985' title='20985'>10th. </span>
<span sid='20986' title='20986'>John Swain cleared.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20987' title='20987'>12th. </span>
<span sid='20988' title='20988'>Visited Paramore. </span>
<span sid='20989' title='20989'>All well.</span>
<p>
<span sid='20990' title='20990'>'Thank you!' said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor. </span>
<span sid='20991' title='20991'>'And now you must on no account lose another instant. </span>
<span sid='20992' title='20992'>We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. </span>
<span sid='20993' title='20993'>You must get home instantly, and act.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20994' title='20994'>'What shall I do?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='20995' title='20995'>'There is but one thing to do. </span>
<span sid='20996' title='20996'>It must be done at once. </span>
<span sid='20997' title='20997'>You must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described. </span>
<span sid='20998' title='20998'>You must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one which remains. </span>
<span sid='20999' title='20999'>You must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them. </span>
<span sid='21000' title='21000'>Having done this, you must at once put the box out upon the sun-dial, as directed. </span>
<span sid='21001' title='21001'>Do you understand?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21002' title='21002'>'Entirely.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21003' title='21003'>'Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. </span>
<span sid='21004' title='21004'>I think that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to weave, while theirs is already woven. </span>
<span sid='21005' title='21005'>The first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you. </span>
<span sid='21006' title='21006'>The second is to clear up the mystery, and to punish the guilty parties.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21007' title='21007'>'I thank you,' said the young man, rising, and pulling on his overcoat. </span>
<span sid='21008' title='21008'>'You have given me fresh life and hope. </span>
<span sid='21009' title='21009'>I shall certainly do as you advise.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21010' title='21010'>'Do not lose an instant. </span>
<span sid='21011' title='21011'>And, above all, take care of yourself in the meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger. </span>
<span sid='21012' title='21012'>How do you go back?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21013' title='21013'>'By train from Waterloo.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21014' title='21014'>'It is not yet nine. </span>
<span sid='21015' title='21015'>The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you may be in safety. </span>
<span sid='21016' title='21016'>And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21017' title='21017'>'I am armed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21018' title='21018'>'That is well. </span>
<span sid='21019' title='21019'>To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21020' title='21020'>'I shall see you at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Horsham&t=h'>Horsham</a>, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21021' title='21021'>'No, your secret lies in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='21022' title='21022'>It is there that I shall seek it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21023' title='21023'>'Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to the box and the papers. </span>
<span sid='21024' title='21024'>I shall take your advice in every particular.' </span>
<span sid='21025' title='21025'>He shook hands with us, and took his leave. </span>
<span sid='21026' title='21026'>Outside the wind still screamed, and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows. </span>
<span sid='21027' title='21027'>This strange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elements - blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale - and now to have been re-absorbed by them once more.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21028' title='21028'>Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence with his head sunk forward, and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. </span>
<span sid='21029' title='21029'>Then he lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21030' title='21030'>'I think, Watson,' he remarked at last, 'that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21031' title='21031'>'Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21032' title='21032'>'Well, yes. </span>
<span sid='21033' title='21033'>Save, perhaps, that. </span>
<span sid='21034' title='21034'>And yet this John Openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21035' title='21035'>'But have you,' I asked, 'formed any definite conception as to what these perils are?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21036' title='21036'>'There can be no question as to their nature,' he answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21037' title='21037'>'Then what are they? </span>
<span sid='21038' title='21038'>Who is this K.K.K., and why does he pursue this unhappy family?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21039' title='21039'>Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes, and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. </span>
<span sid='21040' title='21040'>'The ideal reasoner,' he remarked, 'would, when he has once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it, but also all the results which would follow from it. </span>
<span sid='21041' title='21041'>As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents, should be able accurately to state all the other ones, both before and after. </span>
<span sid='21042' title='21042'>We have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to. </span>
<span sid='21043' title='21043'>Problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses. </span>
<span sid='21044' title='21044'>To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilize all the facts which have come to his knowledge, arid this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and encyclopedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. </span>
<span sid='21045' title='21045'>It is not so impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have endeavoured in my case to do. </span>
<span sid='21046' title='21046'>If I remember rightly, you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21047' title='21047'>'Yes,' I answered, laughing. </span>
<span sid='21048' title='21048'>'It was a singular document. </span>
<span sid='21049' title='21049'>Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. </span>
<span sid='21050' title='21050'>Botany variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime records unique, violin player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. </span>
<span sid='21051' title='21051'>Those, I think, were the main points of my analysis.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21052' title='21052'>Holmes grinned at the last item. </span>
<span sid='21053' title='21053'>'Well,' he said, say now, as I said then, that a man should keep his little brain attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it. </span>
<span sid='21054' title='21054'>Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us tonight, we need certainly to muster all our resources. </span>
<span sid='21055' title='21055'>Kindly hand me down the letter K of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n Encyclopedia which stands upon the shelf beside you. </span>
<span sid='21056' title='21056'>Thank you. </span>
<span sid='21057' title='21057'>Now let us consider the situation, and see what may be deduced from it. </span>
<span sid='21058' title='21058'>In the first place, we may start with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>. </span>
<span sid='21059' title='21059'>Men at his time of life do not change all their habits, and exchange willingly the charming climate of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Florida&t=h'>Florida</a> for the lonely life of an English provincial town. </span>
<span sid='21060' title='21060'>His extreme love of solitude in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something, which drove him from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>. </span>
<span sid='21061' title='21061'>As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors. </span>
<span sid='21062' title='21062'>Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21063' title='21063'>'The first was from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pondicherry&t=h'>Pondicherry</a>, the second from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Dundee&t=h'>Dundee</a>,  and the third from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21064' title='21064'>'From East <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='21065' title='21065'>What do you deduce from that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21066' title='21066'>'They are all sea-ports. </span>
<span sid='21067' title='21067'>That the writer was on board a ship.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21068' title='21068'>'Excellent. </span>
<span sid='21069' title='21069'>We have already a clue. </span>
<span sid='21070' title='21070'>There can be no doubt that the probability - the strong probability - is that the writer was on board of a ship. </span>
<span sid='21071' title='21071'>And now let us consider another point. </span>
<span sid='21072' title='21072'>In the case of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pondicherry&t=h'>Pondicherry</a> seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment, in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Dundee&t=h'>Dundee</a> it was only some three or four days. </span>
<span sid='21073' title='21073'>Does that suggest anything?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21074' title='21074'>'A greater distance to travel.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21075' title='21075'>'But the letter had also a greater distance to come.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21076' title='21076'>'Then I do not see the point.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21077' title='21077'>'There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing ship. </span>
<span sid='21078' title='21078'>It looks as if they always sent their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission. </span>
<span sid='21079' title='21079'>You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Dundee&t=h'>Dundee</a>. </span>
<span sid='21080' title='21080'>If they had come from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pondicherry&t=h'>Pondicherry</a> in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter. </span>
<span sid='21081' title='21081'>But as a matter of fact seven weeks elapsed. </span>
<span sid='21082' title='21082'>I think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail boat which brought the letter, and the sailing vessel which brought the writer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21083' title='21083'>It is possible.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21084' title='21084'>'More than that. </span>
<span sid='21085' title='21085'>It is probable. </span>
<span sid='21086' title='21086'>And now you see the deadly urgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. </span>
<span sid='21087' title='21087'>The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance. </span>
<span sid='21088' title='21088'>But this one comes from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, and therefore we cannot count upon delay.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21089' title='21089'>'Good God!' I cried. </span>
<span sid='21090' title='21090'>'What can it mean, this relentless persecution?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21091' title='21091'>'The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing ship. </span>
<span sid='21092' title='21092'>I think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them. </span>
<span sid='21093' title='21093'>A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner's jury. </span>
<span sid='21094' title='21094'>There must have been several in it, and they must have been men of resource and determination. </span>
<span sid='21095' title='21095'>Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may. </span>
<span sid='21096' title='21096'>In this way you see K.K.K. ceases to be the initials of an individual, and becomes the badge of a society.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21097' title='21097'>'But of what society?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21098' title='21098'>'Have you never-' said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his voice - 'have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21099' title='21099'>'I never have.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21100' title='21100'>Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. </span>
<span sid='21101' title='21101'>'Here it is,' said he presently, "Ku Klux Klan. </span>
<span sid='21102' title='21102'>A name derived from a fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle. </span>
<span sid='21103' title='21103'>This terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern States after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country, notably in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Tennessee&t=h'>Tennessee</a>, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Louisiana&t=h'>Louisiana</a>, the Carolinas, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Georgia&t=h'>Georgia</a>, and <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Florida&t=h'>Florida</a>. </span>
<span sid='21104' title='21104'>Its power was used for political purposes, principally for the terrorizing of the negro voters, and the murdering or driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views. </span>
<span sid='21105' title='21105'>Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognized shape - a sprig of oak leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. </span>
<span sid='21106' title='21106'>On receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the country. </span>
<span sid='21107' title='21107'>If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. </span>
<span sid='21108' title='21108'>So perfect was the organization of the society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators. </span>
<span sid='21109' title='21109'>For some years the organization flourished, in spite of the efforts of the United States Government, and of the better classes of the community in the South. </span>
<span sid='21110' title='21110'>Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date."</span>
<p>
<span sid='21111' title='21111'>'You will observe,' said Holmes, laying down the volume, 'that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of Openshaw from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a> with their papers. </span>
<span sid='21112' title='21112'>It may well have been cause and effect. </span>
<span sid='21113' title='21113'>It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track. </span>
<span sid='21114' title='21114'>You can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South, and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21115' title='21115'>'Then the page which we have seen-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21116' title='21116'>'Is such as we might expect. </span>
<span sid='21117' title='21117'>It ran, if I remember right, "sent the pips to A, B, and C" - that is, sent the society's warning to them. </span>
<span sid='21118' title='21118'>Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C. </span>
<span sid='21119' title='21119'>Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told him. </span>
<span sid='21120' title='21120'>There is nothing more to be said or to be done tonight, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather, and the still more miserable ways of our fellow-men.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21121' title='21121'>It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city. </span>
<span sid='21122' title='21122'>Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21123' title='21123'>'You will excuse me for not waiting for you,' said he; 'I have, I foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young Openshaw's.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21124' title='21124'>'What steps will you take?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21125' title='21125'>'It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. </span>
<span sid='21126' title='21126'>I may have to go down to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Horsham&t=h'>Horsham</a> after all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21127' title='21127'>'You will not go there first?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21128' title='21128'>'No, I shall commence with the City Just ring the bell, and the maid will bring up your coffee.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21129' title='21129'>As I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it. </span>
<span sid='21130' title='21130'>It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21131' title='21131'>'Holmes,' I cried, 'you are too late.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21132' title='21132'>'Ah!' said he, laying down his cup, 'I feared as much. </span>
<span sid='21133' title='21133'>How was it done?' </span>
<span sid='21134' title='21134'>He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21135' title='21135'>'My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading "Tragedy near <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Waterloo Bridge&t=h'>Waterloo Bridge</a>". </span>
<span sid='21136' title='21136'>Here is the account: "Between nine and ten last night Police Constable Cook, of the H Division, on duty near <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Waterloo Bridge&t=h'>Waterloo Bridge</a>, heard a cry for help and a splash in the water. </span>
<span sid='21137' title='21137'>The night, however, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a rescue. </span>
<span sid='21138' title='21138'>The alarm, however, was given, and by the aid of the water police, the body was eventually recovered. </span>
<span sid='21139' title='21139'>It proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Horsham&t=h'>Horsham</a>. </span>
<span sid='21140' title='21140'>It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo station, and that in his haste and the extreme darkness, he missed his path and walked - over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. </span>
<span sid='21141' title='21141'>The body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages."'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21142' title='21142'>We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken than I had ever seen him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21143' title='21143'>'That hurts my pride, Watson,' he said at last. </span>
<span sid='21144' title='21144'>'It is a petty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. </span>
<span sid='21145' title='21145'>It becomes a personal matter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang. </span>
<span sid='21146' title='21146'>That he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to his death-!' </span>
<span sid='21147' title='21147'>He sprang from his chair, and paced about the room - in uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks, and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long, thin hands.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21148' title='21148'>'They must be cunning devils,' he exclaimed at last. </span>
<span sid='21149' title='21149'>'How could they have decoyed him down there? </span>
<span sid='21150' title='21150'>The Embankment is not on the direct line to the station. </span>
<span sid='21151' title='21151'>The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. </span>
<span sid='21152' title='21152'>Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in the long run. </span>
<span sid='21153' title='21153'>I am going out now!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21154' title='21154'>'To the police?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21155' title='21155'>'No; I shall be my own police. </span>
<span sid='21156' title='21156'>When I have spun the web they may take the flies, but not before.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21157' title='21157'>All day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the evening before I returned to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='21158' title='21158'>Sherlock Holmes had not come back yet. </span>
<span sid='21159' title='21159'>It was nearly ten o'clock before he entered, looking pale and worn. </span>
<span sid='21160' title='21160'>He walked up to the sideboard, and, tearing a piece from the loaf, he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of water.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21161' title='21161'>'You are hungry,' I remarked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21162' title='21162'>'Starving. </span>
<span sid='21163' title='21163'>It had escaped my memory. </span>
<span sid='21164' title='21164'>I have had nothing since breakfast.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21165' title='21165'>'Nothing?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21166' title='21166'>'Not a bite. </span>
<span sid='21167' title='21167'>I had no time to think of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21168' title='21168'>'And how have you succeeded?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21169' title='21169'>'Well.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21170' title='21170'>'You have a clue?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21171' title='21171'>'I have them in the hollow of my hand. </span>
<span sid='21172' title='21172'>Young Openshaw shall not remain long unavenged. </span>
<span sid='21173' title='21173'>Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon them. </span>
<span sid='21174' title='21174'>It is well thought of!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21175' title='21175'>'What do you mean?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21176' title='21176'>He took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces, he squeezed out the pips upon the table. </span>
<span sid='21177' title='21177'>Of these he took five, and thrust them into an envelope. </span>
<span sid='21178' title='21178'>On the inside of the flap he wrote, 'S.H. for J. O.' </span>
<span sid='21179' title='21179'>Then he sealed it and addressed it to 'Captain James Calhoun, Barque Lone Star, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Savannah&t=h'>Savannah</a>, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Georgia&t=h'>Georgia</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21180' title='21180'>'That will await him when he enters port,' said he, chuckling. </span>
<span sid='21181' title='21181'>'It may give him a sleepless night. </span>
<span sid='21182' title='21182'>He will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21183' title='21183'>'And who is this Captain Calhoun?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21184' title='21184'>'The leader of the gang. </span>
<span sid='21185' title='21185'>I shall have the others, but he first.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21186' title='21186'>'How did you trace it, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21187' title='21187'>He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates and names.</span>
<p>
<span sid='21188' title='21188'>'I have spent the whole day,' said he, 'over <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lloyd's&t=h'>Lloyd's</a> registers and the files of old papers, following the future career of every vessel which touched at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pondicherry&t=h'>Pondicherry</a> in January and in February in '83. </span>
<span sid='21189' title='21189'>There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months. </span>
<span sid='21190' title='21190'>Of these, one, the Lone Star instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, the name is that which is given to one of the States of the Union.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21191' title='21191'>'<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Texas&t=h'>Texas</a>, I think.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21192' title='21192'>'I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n origin.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21193' title='21193'>'What then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21194' title='21194'>'I searched the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Dundee&t=h'>Dundee</a> records, and when I found that the barque Lone Star was there in January, '85, my suspicion became a certainty. </span>
<span sid='21195' title='21195'>I then inquired as to vessels which lay at present in the port of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21196' title='21196'>'Yes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21197' title='21197'>'The Lone Star had arrived here last week. </span>
<span sid='21198' title='21198'>I went down to the Albert Dock, and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning, homeward bound to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Savannah&t=h'>Savannah</a>. </span>
<span sid='21199' title='21199'>I wired to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Gravesend&t=h'>Gravesend</a>, and learned that she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly, I have no doubt that she is now past <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Goodwins&t=h'>the Goodwins</a>, and not very far from the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Isle of Wight&t=h'>Isle of Wight</a>&t=h'><a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Isle of Wight&t=h'>Isle of Wight</a></a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21200' title='21200'>'What will you do, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21201' title='21201'>'Oh, I have my hand upon him. </span>
<span sid='21202' title='21202'>He and the two mates are, as I learn, the only native-born <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>ns in the ship. </span>
<span sid='21203' title='21203'>The others are Finns and Germans. </span>
<span sid='21204' title='21204'>I know also that they were all three away from the ship last night. </span>
<span sid='21205' title='21205'>I had it from the stevedore, who has been loading their cargo. </span>
<span sid='21206' title='21206'>By the time their sailing ship reaches <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Savannah&t=h'>Savannah</a> the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Savannah&t=h'>Savannah</a> that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='21207' title='21207'>There is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another, as cunning and resolute as themselves, was upon their track. </span>
<span sid='21208' title='21208'>Very long and severe were the equinoctial gales of that year. </span>
<span sid='21209' title='21209'>We waited long for news of the Lone Star of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Savannah&t=h'>Savannah</a>, but none ever reached us. </span>
<span sid='21210' title='21210'>We did at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a shattered sternpost of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters 'L. S.' carved upon it, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the Lone Star.</span>
