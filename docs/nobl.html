<p>
<span sid='55082' title='55082'>The Lord St Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long since ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. </span>
<span sid='55083' title='55083'>Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama. </span>
<span sid='55084' title='55084'>As I have reason to believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55085' title='55085'>It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>, that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. </span>
<span sid='55086' title='55086'>I had remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign, throbbed with dull persistency. </span>
<span sid='55087' title='55087'>With my body in one easy chair and my legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers, until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table, and wondering lazily who my friend's noble correspondent could be.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55088' title='55088'>'Here is a very fashionable epistle,' I remarked as he entered. </span>
<span sid='55089' title='55089'>'Your morning's letters, if I remember right, were from a fishmonger and a tide-waiter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55090' title='55090'>'Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,' he answered, smiling, 'and the humbler are usually the more interesting. </span>
<span sid='55091' title='55091'>This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55092' title='55092'>He broke the seal, and glanced over the contents.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55093' title='55093'>'Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest after all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55094' title='55094'>'Not social, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55095' title='55095'>'No, distinctly professional.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55096' title='55096'>'And from a noble client?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55097' title='55097'>'One of the highest in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55098' title='55098'>'My dear fellow, I congratulate you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55099' title='55099'>'I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case. </span>
<span sid='55100' title='55100'>It is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation. </span>
<span sid='55101' title='55101'>You have been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55102' title='55102'>'It looks like it,' said I, ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the corner. </span>
<span sid='55103' title='55103'>'I have had nothing else to do.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55104' title='55104'>'It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. </span>
<span sid='55105' title='55105'>I read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. </span>
<span sid='55106' title='55106'>The latter is always instructive. </span>
<span sid='55107' title='55107'>But if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about Lord St Simon and his wedding?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55108' title='55108'>'Oh, yes, with the deepest interest.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55109' title='55109'>'That is well. </span>
<span sid='55110' title='55110'>The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St Simon. </span>
<span sid='55111' title='55111'>I will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. </span>
<span sid='55112' title='55112'>This is what he says:</span>
<p>
<span sid='55113' title='55113'>MY DEAR MR SHERLOCK HOLMES,</span>
<p>
<span sid='55114' title='55114'>Lord Backwater tells me that I may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. </span>
<span sid='55115' title='55115'>I have determined, therefore, to call upon you, and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding. </span>
<span sid='55116' title='55116'>Mr Lestrade, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>, is acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it might be of some assistance. </span>
<span sid='55117' title='55117'>I will call at four o'clock in the afternoon, and should you have any other engagement at that time, I hope you will postpone it, as this is a matter of paramount importance.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55118' title='55118'>Yours faithfully,</span>
<p>
<span sid='55119' title='55119'>ROBERT ST SIMON</span>
<p>
<span sid='55120' title='55120'>'It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger,' remarked Holmes, as he folded up the epistle.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55121' title='55121'>'He says four o'clock. </span>
<span sid='55122' title='55122'>It is three now. </span>
<span sid='55123' title='55123'>He will be here in an hour.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55124' title='55124'>'Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the subject. </span>
<span sid='55125' title='55125'>Turn over those papers, and arrange the extracts in their order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client is.' </span>
<span sid='55126' title='55126'>He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece. </span>
<span sid='55127' title='55127'>'Here he is,' said he, sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee. </span>
<span sid='55128' title='55128'>"Robert Walsingham de Vere St Simon, second son of the Duke of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Balmoral&t=h'>Balmoral</a> - Hum! </span>
<span sid='55129' title='55129'>"Arms. </span>
<span sid='55130' title='55130'>Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. </span>
<span sid='55131' title='55131'>Born in 1846." </span>
<span sid='55132' title='55132'>He's forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. </span>
<span sid='55133' title='55133'>Was Under-Secretary for the Colonies in a late Administration. </span>
<span sid='55134' title='55134'>The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs. </span>
<span sid='55135' title='55135'>They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on the distaff side. </span>
<span sid='55136' title='55136'>Ha! </span>
<span sid='55137' title='55137'>Well, there is nothing very instructive in all this. </span>
<span sid='55138' title='55138'>I think I must turn to you, Watson, for something more solid.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55139' title='55139'>'I have very little difficulty in finding what I want,' said I, 'for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. </span>
<span sid='55140' title='55140'>I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry on hand, and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55141' title='55141'>'Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van. </span>
<span sid='55142' title='55142'>That is quite cleared up now - though, indeed, it was obvious from the first. </span>
<span sid='55143' title='55143'>Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55144' title='55144'>'Here is the first notice which I can find. </span>
<span sid='55145' title='55145'>It is in the personal column of the Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks back. </span>
<span sid='55146' title='55146'>"A marriage has been arranged," it says, "and will, if rumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St Simon, second son of the Duke of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Balmoral&t=h'>Balmoral</a>, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran, Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A." </span>
<span sid='55147' title='55147'>That is all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55148' title='55148'>'Terse and to the point,' remarked Holmes, stretching his long thin legs towards the fire.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55149' title='55149'>'There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week. </span>
<span sid='55150' title='55150'>Ah, here it is. </span>
<span sid='55151' title='55151'>"There will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market, for the present free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product. </span>
<span sid='55152' title='55152'>One by one the management of the noble houses of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Great Britain&t=h'>Great Britain</a> is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. </span>
<span sid='55153' title='55153'>An important addition has been made during the last week to the list of prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders. </span>
<span sid='55154' title='55154'>Lord St Simon, who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little god's arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=California&t=h'>California</a>n millionaire. </span>
<span sid='55155' title='55155'>Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the West&t=h'>the West</a>bury House festivities, is an only child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future. </span>
<span sid='55156' title='55156'>As it is an open secret that the Duke of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Balmoral&t=h'>Balmoral</a> has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St Simon has no property of his own, save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=California&t=h'>California</a>n heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a republican lady to a British title."'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55157' title='55157'>'Anything else?' asked Holmes, yawning.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55158' title='55158'>'Oh, yes; plenty. </span>
<span sid='55159' title='55159'>Then there is another note in the Morning Post to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at St George's, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited, and that the party would return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr Aloysius Doran. </span>
<span sid='55160' title='55160'>Two days later - that is, on Wednesday last - there is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater's place, near Petersfield. </span>
<span sid='55161' title='55161'>Those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55162' title='55162'>'Before the what?' asked Holmes, with a start.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55163' title='55163'>'The vanishing of the lady.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55164' title='55164'>'When did she vanish, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55165' title='55165'>'At the wedding breakfast.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55166' title='55166'>'Indeed. </span>
<span sid='55167' title='55167'>This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic, in fact.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55168' title='55168'>'Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55169' title='55169'>'They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this. </span>
<span sid='55170' title='55170'>Pray let me have the details.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55171' title='55171'>'I warn you that they are very incomplete.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55172' title='55172'>'Perhaps we may make them less so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55173' title='55173'>'Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning newspaper of yesterday, which I will read to you. </span>
<span sid='55174' title='55174'>It is headed, "Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding":</span>
<p>
<span sid='55175' title='55175'>'"The family of Lord Robert St Simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding. </span>
<span sid='55176' title='55176'>The ceremony, as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about. </span>
<span sid='55177' title='55177'>In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55178' title='55178'>'"The ceremony, which was performed at St George's, Hanover Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the bride, Mr Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Balmoral&t=h'>Balmoral</a>, Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St Simon (the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. </span>
<span sid='55179' title='55179'>The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been prepared. </span>
<span sid='55180' title='55180'>It appears that some little trouble had been caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St Simon.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55181' title='55181'>It was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman. </span>
<span sid='55182' title='55182'>The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition, and retired to her room. </span>
<span sid='55183' title='55183'>Her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed her; but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. </span>
<span sid='55184' title='55184'>One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled: but had refused to credit that it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company. </span>
<span sid='55185' title='55185'>On ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, Mr Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves into communication with the police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business. </span>
<span sid='55186' title='55186'>Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. </span>
<span sid='55187' title='55187'>There are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride."'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55188' title='55188'>'And is that all?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55189' title='55189'>'Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a suggestive one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55190' title='55190'>'And it is?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55191' title='55191'>'That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has actually been arrested. </span>
<span sid='55192' title='55192'>It appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the Allegro, and that she had known the bridegroom for some years. </span>
<span sid='55193' title='55193'>There are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands now - so far as it has been set forth in the public press.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55194' title='55194'>'And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. </span>
<span sid='55195' title='55195'>I would not have missed it for worlds. </span>
<span sid='55196' title='55196'>But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. </span>
<span sid='55197' title='55197'>Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own memory.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55198' title='55198'>'Lord Robert St Simon,' announced our page-boy, throwing open the door. </span>
<span sid='55199' title='55199'>A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. </span>
<span sid='55200' title='55200'>His manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop, and a little bend of the knees as he walked. </span>
<span sid='55201' title='55201'>His hair, too, as he swept off his very curly brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges, and thin upon the top. </span>
<span sid='55202' title='55202'>As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent- leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters. </span>
<span sid='55203' title='55203'>He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eye-glasses.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55204' title='55204'>'Good day, Lord St Simon,' said Holmes, rising and bowing. </span>
<span sid='55205' title='55205'>'Pray take the basket chair. </span>
<span sid='55206' title='55206'>This is my friend and colleague, Dr Watson. </span>
<span sid='55207' title='55207'>Draw up a little to the fire, and we shall talk this matter over.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55208' title='55208'>'A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='55209' title='55209'>I have been cut to the quick. </span>
<span sid='55210' title='55210'>I understand you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of society.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55211' title='55211'>'No, I am descending.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55212' title='55212'>'I beg pardon?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55213' title='55213'>'My last client of the sort was a king.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55214' title='55214'>'Oh, really! </span>
<span sid='55215' title='55215'>I had no idea. </span>
<span sid='55216' title='55216'>And which king?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55217' title='55217'>'The King of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scandinavia&t=h'>Scandinavia</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55218' title='55218'>'What! </span>
<span sid='55219' title='55219'>Had he lost his wife?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55220' title='55220'>'You can understand,' said Holmes suavely, 'that I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in yours.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55221' title='55221'>'Of course! </span>
<span sid='55222' title='55222'>Very right! very right! </span>
<span sid='55223' title='55223'>I'm sure I beg pardon. </span>
<span sid='55224' title='55224'>As to my own case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55225' title='55225'>'Thank you. </span>
<span sid='55226' title='55226'>I have already learned all that is in the public prints, nothing more. </span>
<span sid='55227' title='55227'>I presume that I may take it as correct - this article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55228' title='55228'>Lord St Simon glanced over it. </span>
<span sid='55229' title='55229'>'Yes, it is correct, as far as it goes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55230' title='55230'>'But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion. </span>
<span sid='55231' title='55231'>I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55232' title='55232'>'Pray do so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55233' title='55233'>'When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55234' title='55234'>'In San Francisco, a year ago.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55235' title='55235'>'You were travelling in the States?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55236' title='55236'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55237' title='55237'>'Did you become engaged then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55238' title='55238'>'No,'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55239' title='55239'>'But you were on a friendly footing?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55240' title='55240'>'I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55241' title='55241'>'Her father is very rich?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55242' title='55242'>'He is said to be the richest man on <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Pacific Slope&t=h'>the Pacific Slope</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55243' title='55243'>'And how did he make his money?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55244' title='55244'>'In mining. </span>
<span sid='55245' title='55245'>He had nothing a few years ago. </span>
<span sid='55246' title='55246'>Then he struck gold, invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55247' title='55247'>'Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady's - your wife's character?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55248' title='55248'>The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire. </span>
<span sid='55249' title='55249'>'You see, Mr Holmes,' said he, 'my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man. </span>
<span sid='55250' title='55250'>During that time she ran free in a mining camp, and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come from nature rather than from the schoolmaster. </span>
<span sid='55251' title='55251'>She is what we call in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of traditions. </span>
<span sid='55252' title='55252'>She is impetuous	volcanic, I was about to say. </span>
<span sid='55253' title='55253'>She is swift in making up her mind, and fearless in carrying out her resolutions. </span>
<span sid='55254' title='55254'>On the other hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to bear' (he gave a little stately cough) 'had I not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. </span>
<span sid='55255' title='55255'>I believe she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice, and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55256' title='55256'>'Have you her photograph?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55257' title='55257'>'I brought this with me.' </span>
<span sid='55258' title='55258'>He opened a locket, and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman. </span>
<span sid='55259' title='55259'>It was not a photograph, but an ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth. </span>
<span sid='55260' title='55260'>Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. </span>
<span sid='55261' title='55261'>Then he closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St Simon.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55262' title='55262'>'The young lady came to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, then, and you renewed your acquaintance?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55263' title='55263'>'Yes, her father brought her over for this last <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> season. </span>
<span sid='55264' title='55264'>I met her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55265' title='55265'>'She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55266' title='55266'>'A fair dowry. </span>
<span sid='55267' title='55267'>Not more than is usual in my family.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55268' title='55268'>'And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait accompli?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55269' title='55269'>'I really have made no inquiries on the subject.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55270' title='55270'>'Very naturally not. </span>
<span sid='55271' title='55271'>Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the wedding?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55272' title='55272'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55273' title='55273'>'Was she in good spirits?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55274' title='55274'>'Never better. </span>
<span sid='55275' title='55275'>She kept talking of what we should do in our future lives.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55276' title='55276'>'Indeed. </span>
<span sid='55277' title='55277'>That is very interesting. </span>
<span sid='55278' title='55278'>And on the morning of the wedding?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55279' title='55279'>'She was as bright as possible - at least, until after the ceremony.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55280' title='55280'>'And did you observe any change in her then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55281' title='55281'>'Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp. </span>
<span sid='55282' title='55282'>The incident, however, was too trivial to relate, and can have no possible bearing upon the case.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55283' title='55283'>'Pray let us have it, for all that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55284' title='55284'>'Oh, it is childish. </span>
<span sid='55285' title='55285'>She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry. </span>
<span sid='55286' title='55286'>She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over into the pew. </span>
<span sid='55287' title='55287'>There was a moment's delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall. </span>
<span sid='55288' title='55288'>Yet, when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55289' title='55289'>'Indeed. </span>
<span sid='55290' title='55290'>You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. </span>
<span sid='55291' title='55291'>Some of the general public were present, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55292' title='55292'>'Oh, yes. </span>
<span sid='55293' title='55293'>It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55294' title='55294'>'This gentleman was not one of your wife's friends?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55295' title='55295'>'No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a common-looking person. </span>
<span sid='55296' title='55296'>I hardly noticed his appearance. </span>
<span sid='55297' title='55297'>But really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55298' title='55298'>'Lady St Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. </span>
<span sid='55299' title='55299'>What did she do on re-entering her father's house?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55300' title='55300'>'I saw her in conversation with her maid.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55301' title='55301'>'And who is her maid?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55302' title='55302'>'Alice is her name. </span>
<span sid='55303' title='55303'>She is an <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n, and came from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=California&t=h'>California</a> with her.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55304' title='55304'>'A confidential servant?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55305' title='55305'>'A little too much so. </span>
<span sid='55306' title='55306'>It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties. </span>
<span sid='55307' title='55307'>Still, of course, in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a> they look upon these things in a different way.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55308' title='55308'>'How long did she speak to this Alice?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55309' title='55309'>'Oh, a few minutes. </span>
<span sid='55310' title='55310'>I had something else to think of.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55311' title='55311'>'You did not overhear what they said?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55312' title='55312'>'Lady St Simon said something about "jumping a claim". </span>
<span sid='55313' title='55313'>She was accustomed to use slang of the kind. </span>
<span sid='55314' title='55314'>I have no idea what she meant.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55315' title='55315'>'<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n slang is very expressive sometimes. </span>
<span sid='55316' title='55316'>And what did your wife do when she had finished speaking to her maid?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55317' title='55317'>'She walked into the breakfast-room.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55318' title='55318'>'On your arm?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55319' title='55319'>'No, alone. </span>
<span sid='55320' title='55320'>She was very independent in little matters like that. </span>
<span sid='55321' title='55321'>Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, uttered some words of apology, and left the room. </span>
<span sid='55322' title='55322'>She never came back.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55323' title='55323'>'But this maid Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her room, covered her bride's dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and went out.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55324' title='55324'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='55325' title='55325'>And she was afterwards seen walking into <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Hyde Park&t=h'>Hyde Park</a> in company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had already made a disturbance at Mr Doran's house that morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55326' title='55326'>'Ah, yes. </span>
<span sid='55327' title='55327'>I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and your relations to her.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55328' title='55328'>Lord St Simon shrugged his shoulders, and raised his eyebrows. </span>
<span sid='55329' title='55329'>'We have been on a friendly footing for some years - I may say on a very friendly footing. </span>
<span sid='55330' title='55330'>She used to be at the Allegro. </span>
<span sid='55331' title='55331'>I have not treated her ungenerously, and she has no just cause of complaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='55332' title='55332'>Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed, and devotedly attached to me. </span>
<span sid='55333' title='55333'>She wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that I was to be married, and to tell the truth the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. </span>
<span sid='55334' title='55334'>She came to Mr Doran's door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort, and I had given instructions to the servants, who soon pushed her out again. </span>
<span sid='55335' title='55335'>She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55336' title='55336'>'Did your wife hear all this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55337' title='55337'>'No, thank goodness, she did not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55338' title='55338'>'And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55339' title='55339'>'Yes. </span>
<span sid='55340' title='55340'>That is what Mr Lestrade, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>, looks upon as so serious. </span>
<span sid='55341' title='55341'>It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out, and laid some terrible trap for her.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55342' title='55342'>'Well, it is a possible supposition.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55343' title='55343'>'You think so, too?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55344' title='55344'>'I did not say a probable one. </span>
<span sid='55345' title='55345'>But you do not yourself look upon this as likely?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55346' title='55346'>'I do not think Flora would hurt a fly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55347' title='55347'>'Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. </span>
<span sid='55348' title='55348'>Pray what is your own theory as to what took place?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55349' title='55349'>'Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. </span>
<span sid='55350' title='55350'>I have given you all the facts. </span>
<span sid='55351' title='55351'>Since you ask me, however, I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55352' title='55352'>'In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55353' title='55353'>'Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back - I will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without successâ€”I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55354' title='55354'>'Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,' said Holmes, smiling. </span>
<span sid='55355' title='55355'>And now, Lord St Simon, I think that I have nearly all my data. </span>
<span sid='55356' title='55356'>May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55357' title='55357'>'We could see the other side of the road, and the Park.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55358' title='55358'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='55359' title='55359'>Then I do not think that I need detain you any longer. </span>
<span sid='55360' title='55360'>I shall communicate with you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55361' title='55361'>'Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,' said our client, rising.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55362' title='55362'>'I have solved it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55363' title='55363'>'Eh? </span>
<span sid='55364' title='55364'>What was that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55365' title='55365'>'I say that I have solved it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55366' title='55366'>'Where, then, is my wife?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55367' title='55367'>'That is a detail which I shall speedily supply.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55368' title='55368'>Lord St Simon shook his head. </span>
<span sid='55369' title='55369'>'I am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine,' he remarked, and bowing in a stately, old-fashioned manner, he departed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55370' title='55370'>'It is very good of Lord St Simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own,' said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. </span>
<span sid='55371' title='55371'>'I think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross-questioning. </span>
<span sid='55372' title='55372'>I had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55373' title='55373'>'My dear Holmes!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55374' title='55374'>'I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked before, which were quite as prompt. </span>
<span sid='55375' title='55375'>My whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. </span>
<span sid='55376' title='55376'>Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau's example.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55377' title='55377'>'But I have heard all that you have heard.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55378' title='55378'>'Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me so well. </span>
<span sid='55379' title='55379'>There was a parallel instance in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Aberdeen&t=h'>Aberdeen</a> some years back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian War. </span>
<span sid='55380' title='55380'>It is one of these cases - but hullo, here is Lestrade! </span>
<span sid='55381' title='55381'>Good afternoon, Lestrade! </span>
<span sid='55382' title='55382'>You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55383' title='55383'>The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand. </span>
<span sid='55384' title='55384'>With a short greeting he seated himself, and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55385' title='55385'>'What's up, then?' asked Holmes, with a twinkle in his eye. </span>
<span sid='55386' title='55386'>'You look dissatisfied.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55387' title='55387'>'And I feel dissatisfied. </span>
<span sid='55388' title='55388'>It is this infernal St Simon marriage case. </span>
<span sid='55389' title='55389'>I can make neither head nor tail of the business.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55390' title='55390'>'Really! </span>
<span sid='55391' title='55391'>You surprise me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55392' title='55392'>'Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? </span>
<span sid='55393' title='55393'>Every clue seems to slip through my fingers. </span>
<span sid='55394' title='55394'>I have been at work upon it all clay.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55395' title='55395'>'And very wet it seems to have made you,' said Holmes, laying his hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55396' title='55396'>'Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine:</span>
<p>
<span sid='55397' title='55397'>'In Heaven's name, what for?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55398' title='55398'>'In search of the body of Lady St Simon.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55399' title='55399'>Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55400' title='55400'>'Have you dragged the basin of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Trafalgar Square&t=h'>Trafalgar Square</a> fountain?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55401' title='55401'>'Why? </span>
<span sid='55402' title='55402'>What do you mean?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55403' title='55403'>'Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55404' title='55404'>Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. </span>
<span sid='55405' title='55405'>'I suppose you know all about it,' he snarled.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55406' title='55406'>'Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55407' title='55407'>'Oh, indeed! </span>
<span sid='55408' title='55408'>Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the matter?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55409' title='55409'>'I think it very unlikely.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55410' title='55410'>'Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?' </span>
<span sid='55411' title='55411'>He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled on to the floor a wedding dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes, and a bride's wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. </span>
<span sid='55412' title='55412'>'There,' said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. </span>
<span sid='55413' title='55413'>'There is a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55414' title='55414'>'Oh, indeed,' said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. </span>
<span sid='55415' title='55415'>'You dragged them from the Serpentine?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55416' title='55416'>'No. </span>
<span sid='55417' title='55417'>They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. </span>
<span sid='55418' title='55418'>They were identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55419' title='55419'>'By the same brilliant reasoning, every man's body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. </span>
<span sid='55420' title='55420'>And pray what did you hope to arrive at through this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55421' title='55421'>'At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55422' title='55422'>'I am afraid you will find it difficult.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55423' title='55423'>'Are you indeed, now?' cried Lestrade, with some bitterness. </span>
<span sid='55424' title='55424'>'I am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences. </span>
<span sid='55425' title='55425'>You have made two blunders in as many minutes This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55426' title='55426'>'And how?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55427' title='55427'>'In the dress is a pocket. </span>
<span sid='55428' title='55428'>In the pocket is a card-case. </span>
<span sid='55429' title='55429'>In the card-case is a note. </span>
<span sid='55430' title='55430'>And here is the very note.' </span>
<span sid='55431' title='55431'>He slapped it down upon the table in front of him 'Listen to this. </span>
<span sid='55432' title='55432'>"You will see me when all is ready. </span>
<span sid='55433' title='55433'>Come at once, F.H.M." </span>
<span sid='55434' title='55434'>Now my theory all along has been that Lady St Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she, with confederates no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance. </span>
<span sid='55435' title='55435'>Here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door, and which lured her within their reach.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55436' title='55436'>'Very good, Lestrade,' said Holmes, laughing. </span>
<span sid='55437' title='55437'>'You really are very fine indeed. </span>
<span sid='55438' title='55438'>Let me see it.' </span>
<span sid='55439' title='55439'>He took up the paper in a listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of satisfaction. </span>
<span sid='55440' title='55440'>'This is indeed important,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55441' title='55441'>'Ha, you find it so?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55442' title='55442'>'Extremely so. </span>
<span sid='55443' title='55443'>I congratulate you warmly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55444' title='55444'>Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. </span>
<span sid='55445' title='55445'>'Why,' he shrieked, 'you're looking on the wrong side.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55446' title='55446'>'On the contrary, this is the right side.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55447' title='55447'>'The right side? </span>
<span sid='55448' title='55448'>You're mad! </span>
<span sid='55449' title='55449'>Here is the note written in pencil over here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55450' title='55450'>'And over here is what appears to be a fragment of a hotel bill, which interests me deeply.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55451' title='55451'>'There's nothing in it. </span>
<span sid='55452' title='55452'>I looked at it before,' said Lestrade.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55453' title='55453'>'"Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s. 6d., glass sherry 8d." </span>
<span sid='55454' title='55454'>I see nothing in that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55455' title='55455'>'Very likely not. </span>
<span sid='55456' title='55456'>It is most important all the same. </span>
<span sid='55457' title='55457'>As to the note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate you again.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55458' title='55458'>'I've wasted time enough,' said Lestrade, rising, 'I believe in hard work, and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. </span>
<span sid='55459' title='55459'>Good-day, Mr Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first.' </span>
<span sid='55460' title='55460'>He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made for the door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55461' title='55461'>'Just one hint to you, Lestrade,' drawled Holmes, before his rival vanished; 'I will tell you the true solution of the matter Lady St Simon is a myth. </span>
<span sid='55462' title='55462'>There is not, and there never has been, any such person.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55463' title='55463'>Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. </span>
<span sid='55464' title='55464'>Then he turned to me, tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55465' title='55465'>He had hardly shut the door behind him, when Holmes rose and put on his overcoat. </span>
<span sid='55466' title='55466'>'There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work,' he remarked, 'so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your papers for a little.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55467' title='55467'>It was after five o'clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner's man with a very large flat box. </span>
<span sid='55468' title='55468'>This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. </span>
<span sid='55469' title='55469'>There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a pÃ¢tÃ© de foie gras pie, with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles. </span>
<span sid='55470' title='55470'>Having laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid for, and were ordered to this address.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55471' title='55471'>Just before nine o'clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room. </span>
<span sid='55472' title='55472'>His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55473' title='55473'>'They have laid the supper, then,' he said, rubbing his hands.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55474' title='55474'>'You seem to expect company. </span>
<span sid='55475' title='55475'>They have laid for five.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55476' title='55476'>'Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,' said he. </span>
<span sid='55477' title='55477'>'I am surprised that Lord St Simon has not already arrived. </span>
<span sid='55478' title='55478'>Ha! </span>
<span sid='55479' title='55479'>I fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55480' title='55480'>It was indeed our visitor of the morning who came bustling in, dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55481' title='55481'>'My messenger reached you, then?' asked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55482' title='55482'>'Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. </span>
<span sid='55483' title='55483'>Have you good authority for what you say?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55484' title='55484'>'The best possible.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55485' title='55485'>Lord St Simon sank into a chair, and passed his hand over his forehead.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55486' title='55486'>'What will the Duke say,' he murmured, 'when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such a humiliation?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55487' title='55487'>'It is the purest accident. </span>
<span sid='55488' title='55488'>I cannot allow that there is any humiliation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55489' title='55489'>'Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55490' title='55490'>'I fail to see that anyone is to blame. </span>
<span sid='55491' title='55491'>I can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. </span>
<span sid='55492' title='55492'>Having no mother, she had no one to advise her at such a crisis.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55493' title='55493'>'It was a slight, sir, a public slight,' said Lord St Simon, tapping his fingers upon the table.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55494' title='55494'>'You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented a position.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55495' title='55495'>'I will make no allowance. </span>
<span sid='55496' title='55496'>I am very angry indeed, and I have been shamefully used.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55497' title='55497'>'I think I heard a ring,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='55498' title='55498'>'Yes, there are steps on the landing. </span>
<span sid='55499' title='55499'>If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter, Lord St Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more successful.' </span>
<span sid='55500' title='55500'>He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman. </span>
<span sid='55501' title='55501'>'Lord St Simon,' said he, 'allow me to introduce you to Mr and Mrs Francis Hay Moulton. </span>
<span sid='55502' title='55502'>The lady, I think, you have already met.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55503' title='55503'>At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat, and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. </span>
<span sid='55504' title='55504'>The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. </span>
<span sid='55505' title='55505'>It was as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55506' title='55506'>'You're angry, Robert,' said she. </span>
<span sid='55507' title='55507'>'Well, I guess you have every cause to be.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55508' title='55508'>'Pray make no apology to me,' said Lord St Simon, bitterly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55509' title='55509'>'Oh, yes, I know that I treated you real bad, and that I should have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again, I just didn't know what I was doing or saying. </span>
<span sid='55510' title='55510'>I only wonder that I didn't fall down and do a faint right there before the altar.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55511' title='55511'>'Perhaps, Mrs Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55512' title='55512'>'If I may give an opinion,' remarked the strange gentleman, 'we've had just a little too much secrecy over this business already. </span>
<span sid='55513' title='55513'>For my part, I should like all <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a> and <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a> to hear the rights of it.' </span>
<span sid='55514' title='55514'>He was a small, wiry, sunburned man, with a sharp face and alert manner.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55515' title='55515'>'Then I'll tell our story right away,' said the lady. </span>
<span sid='55516' title='55516'>'Frank here and I met in '81, in McQuire's camp, near the Rockies, where Pa was working a claim. </span>
<span sid='55517' title='55517'>We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day father struck a rich pocket, and made a pile, while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing. </span>
<span sid='55518' title='55518'>The richer Pa grew, the poorer was Frank; so at last Pa wouldn't hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took me away to 'Frisco. </span>
<span sid='55519' title='55519'>Frank wouldn't throw up his hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without Pa knowing anything about it. </span>
<span sid='55520' title='55520'>It would only have made him mad to know, so we just fixed it all up for ourselves. </span>
<span sid='55521' title='55521'>Frank said that he would go and make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa. </span>
<span sid='55522' title='55522'>So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time, and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived. </span>
<span sid='55523' title='55523'>"Why shouldn't we be married right away, then," said he, "and then I will feel sure of you; and I won't claim to be your husband until I come back." </span>
<span sid='55524' title='55524'>Well, we talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek his fortune and I went back to Pa.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55525' title='55525'>'The next that I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went prospecting into Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. </span>
<span sid='55526' title='55526'>After that came along newspaper story about how a miners' camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank's name among the killed. </span>
<span sid='55527' title='55527'>I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. </span>
<span sid='55528' title='55528'>Pa thought I had a decline, and took me to half the doctors in 'Frisco. </span>
<span sid='55529' title='55529'>Not a word of news came for a year or more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead. </span>
<span sid='55530' title='55530'>Then Lord St Simon came to 'Frisco, and we came to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, and a marriage was arranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55531' title='55531'>'Still, if I had married Lord St Simon, of course I'd have done my duty by him. </span>
<span sid='55532' title='55532'>We can't command our love, but we can our actions. </span>
<span sid='55533' title='55533'>I went to the altar with him with the intention that I would make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. </span>
<span sid='55534' title='55534'>But you may imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I glanced and saw Frank standing looking at me out of the first pew. </span>
<span sid='55535' title='55535'>I thought it was his ghost at first; but, when I looked again, there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. </span>
<span sid='55536' title='55536'>I wonder I didn't drop. </span>
<span sid='55537' title='55537'>I know that everything was turning round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear. </span>
<span sid='55538' title='55538'>I didn't know what to do. </span>
<span sid='55539' title='55539'>Should I stop the service and make a scene in the church? </span>
<span sid='55540' title='55540'>I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. </span>
<span sid='55541' title='55541'>Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew he was writing me a note. </span>
<span sid='55542' title='55542'>As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. </span>
<span sid='55543' title='55543'>It was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so. </span>
<span sid='55544' title='55544'>Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55545' title='55545'>'When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=California&t=h'>California</a>, and had always been his friend. </span>
<span sid='55546' title='55546'>I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready. </span>
<span sid='55547' title='55547'>I know I ought to have spoken to Lord St Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people. </span>
<span sid='55548' title='55548'>I just made up my mind to run away, and explain afterwards. </span>
<span sid='55549' title='55549'>I hadn't been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of the road. </span>
<span sid='55550' title='55550'>He beckoned to me, and then began walking into the Park. </span>
<span sid='55551' title='55551'>I slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. </span>
<span sid='55552' title='55552'>Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St Simon to me - seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also - but I managed to get away from her, and soon overtook Frank. </span>
<span sid='55553' title='55553'>We got into a cab together, and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. </span>
<span sid='55554' title='55554'>Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to 'Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55555' title='55555'>'I saw it in a paper,' explained the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n. </span>
<span sid='55556' title='55556'>'It gave the name and the church, but not where the lady lived.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55557' title='55557'>'Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I would like to vanish away and never see any of them again, just sending a line to Pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. </span>
<span sid='55558' title='55558'>It was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table, and waiting for me to come back. </span>
<span sid='55559' title='55559'>So Frank took my wedding clothes and things, and made a bundle of them so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one should find them. </span>
<span sid='55560' title='55560'>It is likely that we should have gone on to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Paris&t=h'>Paris</a> to-morrow, only that this good gentleman, Mr Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should put ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. </span>
<span sid='55561' title='55561'>Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord St Simon alone, and so we came right away and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very meanly of me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55562' title='55562'>Lord St Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55563' title='55563'>'Excuse me,' he said, 'but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55564' title='55564'>'Then you won't forgive me? </span>
<span sid='55565' title='55565'>You won't shake hands before I go?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55566' title='55566'>'Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.' </span>
<span sid='55567' title='55567'>He put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55568' title='55568'>'I had hoped,' suggested Holmes, 'that you would have joined us in a friendly supper.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55569' title='55569'>'I think that there you ask a little too much,' responded his lordship. </span>
<span sid='55570' title='55570'>'I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over them. </span>
<span sid='55571' title='55571'>I think that, with your permission, I will now wish you all a very good night.' </span>
<span sid='55572' title='55572'>He included us all in a sweeping bow, and stalked out of the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55573' title='55573'>'Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your company,' said Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='55574' title='55574'>'It is always a joy to me to meet an <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n, Mr Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a Minister in far gone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55575' title='55575'>'The case has been an interesting one,' remarked Holmes, when our visitors had left, 'because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable. </span>
<span sid='55576' title='55576'>Nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr Lestrade of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55577' title='55577'>'You were not yourself at fault, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55578' title='55578'>'From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home. </span>
<span sid='55579' title='55579'>Obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. </span>
<span sid='55580' title='55580'>What could that something be? </span>
<span sid='55581' title='55581'>She could not have spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. </span>
<span sid='55582' title='55582'>Had she seen someone, then? </span>
<span sid='55583' title='55583'>If she had, it must be someone from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>, because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely. </span>
<span sid='55584' title='55584'>You see we have already arrived, by a process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n. </span>
<span sid='55585' title='55585'>Then who could this <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n be, and why should he possess so much influence over her? </span>
<span sid='55586' title='55586'>It might be a lover; it might be a husband. </span>
<span sid='55587' title='55587'>Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes, and under strange conditions. </span>
<span sid='55588' title='55588'>So far had I got before I ever heard Lord St Simon's narrative. </span>
<span sid='55589' title='55589'>When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride's manner, of so transparent a device of obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping, which in miners' parlance means taking possession of that which another person has prior claim to, the whole situation became absolutely clear. </span>
<span sid='55590' title='55590'>She had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband, the chances being in favour of the latter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55591' title='55591'>'And how in the world did you find them?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55592' title='55592'>'It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know. </span>
<span sid='55593' title='55593'>The initials were of course of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> hotels.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55594' title='55594'>'How did you deduce the select?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55595' title='55595'>'By the select prices. </span>
<span sid='55596' title='55596'>Eight shillings for a bed and eight- pence for a glass of sherry, pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. </span>
<span sid='55597' title='55597'>There are not many in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> which charge at that rate. </span>
<span sid='55598' title='55598'>In the second one which I visited in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Northumberland Avenue&t=h'>Northumberland Avenue</a>, I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. </span>
<span sid='55599' title='55599'>Moulton, an <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. </span>
<span sid='55600' title='55600'>His letters were to be forwarded to 226, Gordon Square, so thither I travelled, and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them some paternal advice, and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer, both to the general public and to Lord St Simon in particular. </span>
<span sid='55601' title='55601'>I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the appointment.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55602' title='55602'>'But with no very good results,' I remarked. </span>
<span sid='55603' title='55603'>'His conduct was certainly not very gracious.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55604' title='55604'>'Ah! </span>
