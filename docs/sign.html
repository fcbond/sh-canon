<p>
<span sid='40007' title='40007'>1. The Science of Deduction</span>
<p>
<span sid='40008' title='40008'>Sherlock Holmes took his bottle from the corner of the mantel-piece, and his hypodermic syringe from its neat morocco case. </span>
<span sid='40009' title='40009'>With his long, white, nervous fingers he adjusted the delicate needle, and rolled back his left shirt-cuff. </span>
<span sid='40010' title='40010'>For some little time his eyes rested thoughtfully upon the sinewy forearm and wrist, all dotted and scarred with innumerable puncture-marks. </span>
<span sid='40011' title='40011'>Finally, he thrust the sharp point home, pressed down the tiny piston, and sank back into the velvet-lined arm-chair with a long sigh of satisfaction.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40012' title='40012'>Three times a day for many months I had witnessed this performance, but custom had not reconciled my mind to it. </span>
<span sid='40013' title='40013'>On the contrary, from day to day I had become more irritable at the sight, and my conscience swelled nightly within me at the thought that I had lacked the courage to protest. </span>
<span sid='40014' title='40014'>Again and again I had registered a vow that I should deliver my soul upon the subject; but there was that in the cool, nonchalant air of my companion which made him the last man with whom one would care to take anything approaching to a liberty. </span>
<span sid='40015' title='40015'>His great powers, his masterly manner, and the experience which I had had of his many extraordinary qualities, all made me diffident and backward in crossing him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40016' title='40016'>Yet upon that afternoon, whether it was the Beaune which I had taken with my lunch, or the additional exasperation produced by the extreme deliberation of his manner, I suddenly felt that I could hold out no longer.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40017' title='40017'>'Which is it to-day,' I asked, 'morphine or cocaine?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40018' title='40018'>He raised his eyes languidly from the old blackletter volume which he had opened.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40019' title='40019'>'It is cocaine,' he said, 'a seven-per-cent. solution. </span>
<span sid='40020' title='40020'>Would you care to try it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40021' title='40021'>'No, indeed,' I answered, brusquely. </span>
<span sid='40022' title='40022'>'My constitution has not got over the Afghan campaign yet. </span>
<span sid='40023' title='40023'>I cannot afford to throw any extra strain upon it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40024' title='40024'>He smiled at my vehemence. </span>
<span sid='40025' title='40025'>'Perhaps you are right, Watson,' he said. </span>
<span sid='40026' title='40026'>'I suppose that its influence is physically a bad one. </span>
<span sid='40027' title='40027'>I find it, however, so transcendently stimulating and clarifying to the mind that its secondary action is a matter of small moment.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40028' title='40028'>'But consider!' I said, earnestly. </span>
<span sid='40029' title='40029'>'Count the cost! </span>
<span sid='40030' title='40030'>Your brain may, as you say, be roused and excited, but it is a pathological and morbid process, which involves increased tissue-change, and may at last leave a permanent weakness. </span>
<span sid='40031' title='40031'>You know, too, what a black reaction comes upon you. </span>
<span sid='40032' title='40032'>Surely the game is hardly worth the candle. </span>
<span sid='40033' title='40033'>Why should you, for a mere passing pleasure, risk the loss of those great powers with which you have been endowed? </span>
<span sid='40034' title='40034'>Remember that I speak not only as one comrade to another, but as a medical man to one for whose constitution he is to some extent answerable.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40035' title='40035'>He did not seem offended. </span>
<span sid='40036' title='40036'>On the contrary, he put his finger-tips together, and leaned his elbows on the arms of his chair, like one who has a relish for conversation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40037' title='40037'>'My mind,' he said, 'rebels at stagnation. </span>
<span sid='40038' title='40038'>Give me problems, give me work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram, or the most intricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. </span>
<span sid='40039' title='40039'>I can dispense then with artificial stimulants. </span>
<span sid='40040' title='40040'>But I abhor the dull routine of existence. </span>
<span sid='40041' title='40041'>I crave for mental exaltation. </span>
<span sid='40042' title='40042'>That is why I have chosen my own particular profession, or rather created it, for I am the only one in the world.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40043' title='40043'>'The only unofficial detective?' I said, raising my eyebrows.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40044' title='40044'>'The only unofficial consulting detective,' he answered. </span>
<span sid='40045' title='40045'>'I am the last and highest court of appeal in detection. </span>
<span sid='40046' title='40046'>When Gregson, or Lestrade, or Athelney Jones are out of their depths - which, by the way, is their normal state - the matter is laid before me. </span>
<span sid='40047' title='40047'>I examine the data, as an expert, and pronounce a specialist's opinion. </span>
<span sid='40048' title='40048'>I claim no credit in such cases. </span>
<span sid='40049' title='40049'>My name figures in no newspaper. </span>
<span sid='40050' title='40050'>The work itself, the pleasure of finding a field for my peculiar powers, is my highest reward. </span>
<span sid='40051' title='40051'>But you have yourself had some experience of my methods of work in the Jefferson Hope case.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40052' title='40052'>'Yes, indeed,' said I, cordially. </span>
<span sid='40053' title='40053'>'I was never so struck by anything in my life. </span>
<span sid='40054' title='40054'>I even embodied it in a small brochure, with the somewhat fantastic title of A Study in Scarlet."'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40055' title='40055'>He shook his head sadly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40056' title='40056'>'I glanced over it,' said he. </span>
<span sid='40057' title='40057'>'Honestly, I cannot congratulate you upon it. </span>
<span sid='40058' title='40058'>Detection is, or ought to be, an exact science, and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional manner. </span>
<span sid='40059' title='40059'>You have attempted to tinge it with romanticism, which produces much the same effect as if you worked a love-story or an elopement into the fifth proposition of Euclid.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40060' title='40060'>'But the romance was there,' I remonstrated. </span>
<span sid='40061' title='40061'>'I could not tamper with the facts.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40062' title='40062'>'Some facts should be suppressed, or, at least, a just sense of proportion should be observed in treating them. </span>
<span sid='40063' title='40063'>The only point in the case which deserved mention was the curious analytical reasoning from effects to causes, by which I succeeded in unravelling it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40064' title='40064'>I was annoyed at this criticism of a work which had been specially designed to please him. </span>
<span sid='40065' title='40065'>I confess, too, that I was irritated by the egotism which seemed to demand that every line of my pamphlet should be devoted to his own special doings. </span>
<span sid='40066' title='40066'>More than once during the years that I had lived with him in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> I had observed that a small vanity underlay my companion's quiet and didactic manner. </span>
<span sid='40067' title='40067'>I made no remark, however, but sat nursing my wounded leg. </span>
<span sid='40068' title='40068'>I had had a Jezail bullet through it some time before, and, though it did not prevent me from walking, it ached wearily at every change of the weather.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40069' title='40069'>'My practice has extended recently to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Continent&t=h'>the Continent</a>,' said Holmes, after awhile, filling up his old briar-root pipe. </span>
<span sid='40070' title='40070'>'I was consulted last week by François le Villard, who, as you probably know, has come rather to the front lately in the French detective service. </span>
<span sid='40071' title='40071'>He has all the Celtic power of quick intuition, but he is deficient in the wide range of exact knowledge which is essential to the higher developments of his art. </span>
<span sid='40072' title='40072'>The case was concerned with a will, and possessed some features of interest. </span>
<span sid='40073' title='40073'>I was able to refer him to two parallel cases, the one at Riga in 1857, and the other at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=St. Louis&t=h'>St. Louis</a> in 1871, which have suggested to him the true solution. </span>
<span sid='40074' title='40074'>Here is the letter which I had this morning acknowledging my assistance.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40075' title='40075'>He tossed over, as he spoke, a crumpled sheet of foreign note-paper. </span>
<span sid='40076' title='40076'>I glanced my eyes down it, catching a profusion of notes of admiration, with stray 'magnifiques,' 'coup-de-maîtres,' and 'tours-de-force,' all testifying to the ardent admiration of the Frenchman.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40077' title='40077'>'He speaks as a pupil to his master,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40078' title='40078'>'Oh, he rates my assistance too highly,' said Sherlock Holmes, lightly. </span>
<span sid='40079' title='40079'>'He has considerable gifts himself. </span>
<span sid='40080' title='40080'>He possesses two out of the three qualities necessary for the ideal detective. </span>
<span sid='40081' title='40081'>He has the power of observation and that of deduction. </span>
<span sid='40082' title='40082'>He is only wanting in knowledge, and that may come in time. </span>
<span sid='40083' title='40083'>He is now translating my small works into French.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40084' title='40084'>'Your works?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40085' title='40085'>'Oh, didn't you know?' he cried, laughing. </span>
<span sid='40086' title='40086'>'Yes, I have been guilty of several monographs. </span>
<span sid='40087' title='40087'>They are all upon technical subjects. </span>
<span sid='40088' title='40088'>Here, for example, is one "Upon the Distinction Between the Ashes of the Various Tobaccos." </span>
<span sid='40089' title='40089'>In it I enumerate a hundred and forty forms of cigar, cigarette, and pipe tobacco, with coloured plates illustrating the difference in the ash. </span>
<span sid='40090' title='40090'>It is a point which is continually turning up in criminal trials, and which is sometimes of supreme importance as a clue. </span>
<span sid='40091' title='40091'>If you can say definitely, for example, that some murder had been done by a man who was smoking an Indian lunkah, it obviously narrows your field of search. </span>
<span sid='40092' title='40092'>To the trained eve there is as much difference between the black ash of a Trichinopoly and the white fluff of bird's-eye as there is between a cabbage and a potato.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40093' title='40093'>'You have an extraordinary genius for minutiæ,' I remarked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40094' title='40094'>'I appreciate their importance. </span>
<span sid='40095' title='40095'>Here is my monograph upon the tracing of footsteps, with some remarks upon the uses of plaster of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Paris&t=h'>Paris</a> as a preserver of impresses. </span>
<span sid='40096' title='40096'>Here, too, is a curious little work upon the influence of a trade upon the form of the hand, with lithotypes of the hands of slaters, sailors, corkcutters, compositors, weavers, and diamond-polishers. </span>
<span sid='40097' title='40097'>That is a matter of great practical interest to the scientific detective - especially in cases of unclaimed bodies, or in discovering the antecedents of criminals. </span>
<span sid='40098' title='40098'>But I weary you with my hobby.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40099' title='40099'>'Not at all,' I answered, earnestly. </span>
<span sid='40100' title='40100'>'It is of the greatest interest to me, especially since I have had the opportunity of observing your practical application of it. </span>
<span sid='40101' title='40101'>But you spoke just now of observation and deduction. </span>
<span sid='40102' title='40102'>Surely the one to some extent implies the other.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40103' title='40103'>'Why, hardly,' he answered, leaning back luxuriously in his arm-chair, and sending up thick blue wreaths from his pipe. </span>
<span sid='40104' title='40104'>'For example, observation shows me that you have been to the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Wigmore Street&t=h'>Wigmore Street</a> Post Office this morning, but deduction lets me know that when there you dispatched a telegram.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40105' title='40105'>'Right!' said I. </span>
<span sid='40106' title='40106'>'Right on both points! </span>
<span sid='40107' title='40107'>But I confess that I don't see how you arrived at it. </span>
<span sid='40108' title='40108'>It was a sudden impulse upon my part, and I have mentioned it to no one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40109' title='40109'>'It is simplicity itself,' he remarked, chuckling at my surprise - 'so absurdly simple that an explanation is superfluous; and yet it may serve to define the limits of observation and of deduction. </span>
<span sid='40110' title='40110'>Observation tells me that you have a little reddish mould adhering to your instep. </span>
<span sid='40111' title='40111'>Just opposite the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Wigmore Street&t=h'>Wigmore Street</a> Office they have taken up the pavement and thrown up some earth, which lies in such a way that it is difficult to avoid treading in it in entering. </span>
<span sid='40112' title='40112'>The earth is of this peculiar reddish tint which is found, as far as I know, nowhere else in the neighbourhood. </span>
<span sid='40113' title='40113'>So much is observation. </span>
<span sid='40114' title='40114'>The rest is deduction.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40115' title='40115'>'How, then, did you deduce the telegram?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40116' title='40116'>'Why, of course I knew that you had not written a letter, since I sat opposite to you all morning. </span>
<span sid='40117' title='40117'>I see also in your open desk there that you have a sheet of stamps and a thick bundle of post-cards. </span>
<span sid='40118' title='40118'>What could you go into the post office for, then, but to send a wire? </span>
<span sid='40119' title='40119'>Eliminate all other factors, and the one which remains must be the truth.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40120' title='40120'>'In this case it certainly is so,' I replied, after a little thought. </span>
<span sid='40121' title='40121'>'The thing, however, is, as you say, of the simplest. </span>
<span sid='40122' title='40122'>Would you think me impertinent if I were to put your theories to a more severe test?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40123' title='40123'>'On the contrary,' he answered; 'it would prevent me from taking a second dose of cocaine. </span>
<span sid='40124' title='40124'>I should be delighted to look into any problem which you might submit to me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40125' title='40125'>'I have heard you say that it is difficult for a man to have any object in daily use without leaving the impress of his individuality upon it in such a way that a trained observer might read it. </span>
<span sid='40126' title='40126'>Now, I have here a watch which has recently come into my possession. </span>
<span sid='40127' title='40127'>Would you have the kindness to let me have an opinion upon the character or habits of the late owner?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40128' title='40128'>I handed him over the watch with some slight feeling of amusement in my heart, for the test was, as I thought, an impossible one, and I intended it as a lesson against the somewhat dogmatic tone which he occasionally assumed. </span>
<span sid='40129' title='40129'>He balanced the watch in his hand, gazed hard at the dial, opened the back, and examined the works, first with his naked eyes and then with a powerful convex lens. </span>
<span sid='40130' title='40130'>I could hardly keep from smiling at his crestfallen face when he finally snapped the case to and handed it back.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40131' title='40131'>'There are hardly any data,' he remarked. </span>
<span sid='40132' title='40132'>'The watch has been recently cleaned, which robs me of my most suggestive facts.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40133' title='40133'>'You are right,' I answered. </span>
<span sid='40134' title='40134'>'It was cleaned before being sent to me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40135' title='40135'>In my heart I accused my companion of putting forward a most lame and impotent excuse to cover his failure. </span>
<span sid='40136' title='40136'>What data could he expect from an uncleaned watch?</span>
<p>
<span sid='40137' title='40137'>'Though unsatisfactory, my research has not been entirely barren,' he observed, staring up at the ceiling with dreamy, lack-lustre eyes. </span>
<span sid='40138' title='40138'>'Subject to your correction, I should judge that the watch belonged to your elder brother, who inherited it from your father.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40139' title='40139'>'That you gather, no doubt, from the H. W. upon the back?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40140' title='40140'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='40141' title='40141'>The W. suggests your own name. </span>
<span sid='40142' title='40142'>The date of the watch is nearly fifty years back and the initials are as old as the watch; so it was made for the last generation. </span>
<span sid='40143' title='40143'>Jewellery usually descends to the eldest son, and he is most likely to have the same name as the father. </span>
<span sid='40144' title='40144'>Your father has, if I remember right, been dead many years. </span>
<span sid='40145' title='40145'>It has, therefore, been in the hands of your eldest brother.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40146' title='40146'>'Right, so far,' said I. </span>
<span sid='40147' title='40147'>'Anything else?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40148' title='40148'>'He was a man of untidy habits - very untidy and careless. </span>
<span sid='40149' title='40149'>He was left with good prospects, but he threw away his chances, lived for some time in poverty with occasional short intervals of prosperity, and, finally, taking to drink, he died. </span>
<span sid='40150' title='40150'>That is all I can gather.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40151' title='40151'>I sprang from my chair and limped impatiently about the room with considerable bitterness in my heart.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40152' title='40152'>'This is unworthy of you, Holmes,' I said. </span>
<span sid='40153' title='40153'>'I could not have believed that you would have descended to this. </span>
<span sid='40154' title='40154'>You have made inquiries into the history of my unhappy brother, and you now pretend to deduce this knowledge in some fanciful way. </span>
<span sid='40155' title='40155'>You cannot expect me to believe that you have read all this from his old watch! </span>
<span sid='40156' title='40156'>It is unkind, and, to speak plainly, has a touch of charlatanism in it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40157' title='40157'>'My dear doctor,' said he, kindly, 'pray accept my apologies. </span>
<span sid='40158' title='40158'>Viewing the matter as an abstract problem, I had forgotten how personal and painful a thing it might be to you. </span>
<span sid='40159' title='40159'>I assure you, however, that I never even knew that you had a brother until you handed me the watch.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40160' title='40160'>'Then how in the name of all that is wonderful did you get these facts? </span>
<span sid='40161' title='40161'>They are absolutely correct in every particular.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40162' title='40162'>'Ah, that is good luck. </span>
<span sid='40163' title='40163'>I could only say what was the balance of probability. </span>
<span sid='40164' title='40164'>I did not at all expect to be accurate.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40165' title='40165'>'But it was not mere guesswork?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40166' title='40166'>'No, no: I never guess. </span>
<span sid='40167' title='40167'>It is a shocking habit - destructive to the logical faculty. </span>
<span sid='40168' title='40168'>What seems strange to you is only so because you do not follow my train of thought or observe the small facts upon which large inferences may depend. </span>
<span sid='40169' title='40169'>For example, I began by stating that your brother was careless. </span>
<span sid='40170' title='40170'>When you observe the lower part of that watch-case you notice that it is not only dinted in two places, but it is cut and marked all over from the habit of keeping other hard objects, such as coins or keys, in the same pocket. </span>
<span sid='40171' title='40171'>Surely it is no great feat to assume that a man who treats a fifty-guinea watch so cavalierly must be a careless man. </span>
<span sid='40172' title='40172'>Neither is it a very far-fetched inference that a man who inherits one article of such value is pretty well provided for in other respects.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40173' title='40173'>I nodded, to show that I followed his reasoning.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40174' title='40174'>'It is very customary for pawnbrokers in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, when they take a watch, to scratch the number of the ticket with a pin-point upon the inside of the case. </span>
<span sid='40175' title='40175'>It is more handy than a label, as there is no risk of the number being lost or transposed. </span>
<span sid='40176' title='40176'>There are no less than four such numbers visible to my lens on the inside of this case. </span>
<span sid='40177' title='40177'>Inference - that your brother was often at low water. </span>
<span sid='40178' title='40178'>Secondary inference - that he had occasional bursts of prosperity, or he could not have redeemed the pledge. </span>
<span sid='40179' title='40179'>Finally, I ask you to look at the inner plate, which contains the keyhole. </span>
<span sid='40180' title='40180'>Look at the thousands of scratches all round the hole - marks where the key has slipped. </span>
<span sid='40181' title='40181'>What sober man's key could have scored those grooves? </span>
<span sid='40182' title='40182'>But you will never see a drunkard's watch without them. </span>
<span sid='40183' title='40183'>He winds it at night, and he leaves these traces of his unsteady hand. </span>
<span sid='40184' title='40184'>Where is the mystery in all this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40185' title='40185'>'It is as clear as daylight,' I answered. </span>
<span sid='40186' title='40186'>'I regret the injustice which I did you. </span>
<span sid='40187' title='40187'>I should have had more faith in your marvellous faculty. </span>
<span sid='40188' title='40188'>May I ask whether you have any professional inquiry on foot at present?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40189' title='40189'>'None. </span>
<span sid='40190' title='40190'>Hence the cocaine. </span>
<span sid='40191' title='40191'>I cannot live without brain-work. </span>
<span sid='40192' title='40192'>What else is there to live for? </span>
<span sid='40193' title='40193'>Stand at the window here. </span>
<span sid='40194' title='40194'>Was ever such a dreary, dismal, unprofitable world? </span>
<span sid='40195' title='40195'>See how the yellow fog swirls down the street and drifts across the dun-coloured houses. </span>
<span sid='40196' title='40196'>What could be more hopelessly prosaic and material? </span>
<span sid='40197' title='40197'>What is the use of having powers, doctor, when one has no field upon which to exert them? </span>
<span sid='40198' title='40198'>Crime is commonplace, existence is commonplace, and no qualities save those which are commonplace have any function upon earth.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40199' title='40199'>I had opened my mouth to reply to this tirade, when, with a crisp knock, our landlady entered, bearing a card upon the brass salver.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40200' title='40200'>'A young lady for you, sir,' she said, addressing my companion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40201' title='40201'>'Miss Mary Morstan,' he read. </span>
<span sid='40202' title='40202'>'Hum! </span>
<span sid='40203' title='40203'>I have no recollection of the name. </span>
<span sid='40204' title='40204'>Ask the young lady to step up, Mrs. Hudson. </span>
<span sid='40205' title='40205'>Don't go, doctor. </span>
<span sid='40206' title='40206'>I should prefer that you remain.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40207' title='40207'>2. The Statement of the Case</span>
<p>
<span sid='40208' title='40208'>Miss Morstan entered the room with a firm step and an outward composure of manner. </span>
<span sid='40209' title='40209'>She was a blonde young lady, small, dainty, well gloved, and dressed in the most perfect taste. </span>
<span sid='40210' title='40210'>There was, however, a plainness and simplicity about her costume which bore with it a suggestion of limited means. </span>
<span sid='40211' title='40211'>The dress was a sombre greyish beige, untrimmed and unbraided, and she wore a small turban of the same dull hue, relieved only by a suspicion of white feather in the side. </span>
<span sid='40212' title='40212'>Her face had neither regularity of feature nor beauty of complexion, but her expression was sweet and amiable, and her large blue eyes were singularly spiritual and sympathetic. </span>
<span sid='40213' title='40213'>In an experience of women which extends over many nations and three separate continents, I have never looked upon a face which gave a clearer promise of a refined and sensitive nature. </span>
<span sid='40214' title='40214'>I could not but observe that, as she took the seat which Sherlock Holmes placed for her, her lips trembled, her hand quivered, and she showed every sign of intense inward agitation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40215' title='40215'>'I have come to you, Mr. Holmes,' she said, 'because you once enabled my employer, Mrs. Cecil Forrester, to unravel a little domestic complication. </span>
<span sid='40216' title='40216'>She was much impressed by your kindness and skill.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40217' title='40217'>'Mrs. Cecil Forrester,' he repeated, thoughtfully. </span>
<span sid='40218' title='40218'>'I believe that I was of some slight service to her. </span>
<span sid='40219' title='40219'>The case, however, as I remember it, was a very simple one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40220' title='40220'>'She did not think so. </span>
<span sid='40221' title='40221'>But at least you cannot say the same of mine. </span>
<span sid='40222' title='40222'>I can hardly imagine anything more strange, more utterly inexplicable, than the situation in which I find myself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40223' title='40223'>Holmes rubbed his hands, and his eyes glistened. </span>
<span sid='40224' title='40224'>He leaned forward in his chair with an expression of extraordinary concentration upon his clear-cut, hawklike features.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40225' title='40225'>'State your case,' said he, in brisk, business tones.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40226' title='40226'>I felt that my position was an embarrassing one.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40227' title='40227'>'You will, I am sure, excuse me,' I said, rising from my chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40228' title='40228'>To my surprise, the young lady held up her gloved hand to detain me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40229' title='40229'>'If your friend,' she said, 'would be good enough to stop, he might be of inestimable service to me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40230' title='40230'>I relapsed into my chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40231' title='40231'>'Briefly,' she continued, 'the facts are these. </span>
<span sid='40232' title='40232'>My father was an officer in an Indian regiment, who sent me home when I was quite a child. </span>
<span sid='40233' title='40233'>My mother was dead, and I had no relative in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>. </span>
<span sid='40234' title='40234'>I was placed, however, in a comfortable boarding establishment at Edinburgh, and there I remained until I was seventeen years of age. </span>
<span sid='40235' title='40235'>In the year 1878 my father, who was senior captain of his regiment, obtained twelve months' leave and came home. </span>
<span sid='40236' title='40236'>He telegraphed to me from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> that he had arrived all safe, and directed me to come down at once, giving the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Langham Hotel&t=h'>Langham Hotel</a> as his address. </span>
<span sid='40237' title='40237'>His message, as I remember, was full of kindness and love. </span>
<span sid='40238' title='40238'>On reaching <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> I drove to the Langham, and was informed that Captain Morstan was staying there, but that he had gone out the night before and had not returned. </span>
<span sid='40239' title='40239'>I waited all day without news of him. </span>
<span sid='40240' title='40240'>That night, on the advice of the manager of the hotel, I communicated with the police, and next morning we advertised in all the papers. </span>
<span sid='40241' title='40241'>Our inquiries led to no result; and from that day to this no word has ever been heard of my unfortunate father. </span>
<span sid='40242' title='40242'>He came home with his heart full of hope, to find some peace, some comfort, and instead-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40243' title='40243'>She put her hand to her throat, and a choking sob cut short the sentence.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40244' title='40244'>'The date?' asked Holmes, opening his note-book.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40245' title='40245'>'He disappeared upon the 3rd of December, 1878 - nearly ten years ago.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40246' title='40246'>'His luggage?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40247' title='40247'>'Remained at the hotel. </span>
<span sid='40248' title='40248'>There was nothing in it to suggest a clue - some clothes, some books, and a considerable number of curiosities from the Andaman Islands. </span>
<span sid='40249' title='40249'>He had been one of the officers in charge of the convict guard there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40250' title='40250'>'Had he any friends in town?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40251' title='40251'>'Only one that we know of - Major Sholto, of his own regiment, the 34th <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bombay&t=h'>Bombay</a> Infantry. </span>
<span sid='40252' title='40252'>The Major had retired some little time before, and lived at Upper <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a>. </span>
<span sid='40253' title='40253'>We communicated with him, of course, but he did not even know that his brother officer was in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40254' title='40254'>'A singular case,' remarked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40255' title='40255'>'I have not yet described to you the most singular part. </span>
<span sid='40256' title='40256'>About six years ago - to be exact, upon the 4th of May, 1882 - an advertisement appeared in The Times asking for the address of Miss Mary Morstan, and stating that it would be to her advantage to come forward. </span>
<span sid='40257' title='40257'>There was no name or address appended. </span>
<span sid='40258' title='40258'>I had at that time just entered the family of Mrs. Cecil Forrester in the capacity of governess. </span>
<span sid='40259' title='40259'>By her advice I published my address in the advertisement column. </span>
<span sid='40260' title='40260'>The same day there arrived through the post a small cardboard box addressed to me, which I found to contain a very large and lustrous pearl. </span>
<span sid='40261' title='40261'>No word of writing was enclosed. </span>
<span sid='40262' title='40262'>Since then every year upon the same date there has always appeared a similar box, containing a similar pearl, without any clue as to the sender. </span>
<span sid='40263' title='40263'>They have been pronounced by an expert to be of a rare variety and of considerable value. </span>
<span sid='40264' title='40264'>You can see for yourselves that they are very handsome.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40265' title='40265'>She opened a flat box as she spoke, and showed me six of the finest pearls that I had ever seen.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40266' title='40266'>'Your statement is most interesting,' said Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='40267' title='40267'>'Has anything else occurred to you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40268' title='40268'>'Yes, and no later than to-day. </span>
<span sid='40269' title='40269'>That is why I have come to you. </span>
<span sid='40270' title='40270'>This morning I received this letter, which you will perhaps read for yourself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40271' title='40271'>'Thank you,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='40272' title='40272'>'The envelope, too, please. </span>
<span sid='40273' title='40273'>Post-mark, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, S.W. Date, July 7. </span>
<span sid='40274' title='40274'>Hum! </span>
<span sid='40275' title='40275'>Man's thumbmark on corner - probably postman. </span>
<span sid='40276' title='40276'>Best quality paper. </span>
<span sid='40277' title='40277'>Envelopes at sixpence a packet. </span>
<span sid='40278' title='40278'>Particular man in his stationery. </span>
<span sid='40279' title='40279'>No address. </span>
<span sid='40280' title='40280'>"Be at the third pillar from the left outside the Lyceum Theatre to-night at seven o'clock. </span>
<span sid='40281' title='40281'>If you are distrustful bring two friends. </span>
<span sid='40282' title='40282'>You are a wronged woman, and shall have justice. </span>
<span sid='40283' title='40283'>Do not bring police. </span>
<span sid='40284' title='40284'>If you do, all will be in vain. </span>
<span sid='40285' title='40285'>Your unknown friend." </span>
<span sid='40286' title='40286'>Well, really, this is a very pretty little mystery! </span>
<span sid='40287' title='40287'>What do you intend to do, Miss Morstan?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40288' title='40288'>'That is exactly what I want to ask you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40289' title='40289'>'Then we shall most certainly go - you and I and-yes, why, Dr. Watson is the very man. </span>
<span sid='40290' title='40290'>Your correspondent says two friends. </span>
<span sid='40291' title='40291'>He and I have worked together before.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40292' title='40292'>'But would he come?' she asked, with something appealing in her voice and expression.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40293' title='40293'>'I shall be proud and happy,' said I, fervently, 'if I can be of any service.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40294' title='40294'>'You are both very kind,' she answered. </span>
<span sid='40295' title='40295'>'I have led a retired life, and have no friends whom I could appeal to. </span>
<span sid='40296' title='40296'>If I am here at six it will do, I suppose?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40297' title='40297'>'You must not be later,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='40298' title='40298'>'There is one other point, however. </span>
<span sid='40299' title='40299'>Is this handwriting the same as that upon the pearl-box addresses?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40300' title='40300'>'I have them here,' she answered, producing half-a-dozen pieces of paper.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40301' title='40301'>'You are certainly a model client. </span>
<span sid='40302' title='40302'>You have the correct intuition. </span>
<span sid='40303' title='40303'>Let us see, now.' </span>
<span sid='40304' title='40304'>He spread out the papers upon the table, and gave little, darting glances from one to the other. </span>
<span sid='40305' title='40305'>'They are disguised hands, except the letter,' he said, presently; 'but there can be no question as to the authorship. </span>
<span sid='40306' title='40306'>See how the irrepressible Greek e will break out, and see the twirl of the final s. </span>
<span sid='40307' title='40307'>They are undoubtedly by the same person. </span>
<span sid='40308' title='40308'>I should not like to suggest false hopes, Miss Morstan, but is there any resemblance between this hand and that of your father?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40309' title='40309'>'Nothing could be more unlike.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40310' title='40310'>'I expected to hear you say so. </span>
<span sid='40311' title='40311'>We shall look out for you, then, at six. </span>
<span sid='40312' title='40312'>Pray allow me to keep the papers. </span>
<span sid='40313' title='40313'>I may look into the matter before then. </span>
<span sid='40314' title='40314'>It is only half-past three. </span>
<span sid='40315' title='40315'>Au revoir, then.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40316' title='40316'>'Au revoir,' said our visitor; and with a bright, kindly glance from one to the other of us, she replaced her pearl-box in her bosom and hurried away.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40317' title='40317'>Standing at the window, I watched her walking briskly down the street, until the grey turban and white feather were but a speck in the sombre crowd.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40318' title='40318'>'What a very attractive woman!' I exclaimed, turning to my companion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40319' title='40319'>He had lit his pipe again, and was leaning back with drooping eyelids. </span>
<span sid='40320' title='40320'>'Is she?' he said, languidly; 'I did not observe.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40321' title='40321'>'You really are an automaton - a calculating machine,' I cried. </span>
<span sid='40322' title='40322'>'There is something positively inhuman in you at times.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40323' title='40323'>He smiled gently.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40324' title='40324'>'It is of the first importance,' he said, 'not to allow your judgment to be biased by personal qualities. </span>
<span sid='40325' title='40325'>A client is to me a mere unit, a factor in a problem. </span>
<span sid='40326' title='40326'>The emotional qualities are antagonistic to clear reasoning. </span>
<span sid='40327' title='40327'>I assure you that the most winning woman I ever knew was hanged for poisoning three little children for their insurance-money, and the most repellent man of my acquaintance is a philanthropist who has spent nearly a quarter of a million upon the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> poor.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40328' title='40328'>'In this case, however-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40329' title='40329'>'I never make exceptions. </span>
<span sid='40330' title='40330'>An exception disproves the rule. </span>
<span sid='40331' title='40331'>Have you ever had occasion to study character in handwriting? </span>
<span sid='40332' title='40332'>What do you make of this fellow's scribble?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40333' title='40333'>'It is legible and regular,' I answered. </span>
<span sid='40334' title='40334'>'A man of business habits and some force of character.' </span>
<span sid='40335' title='40335'>Holmes shook his head.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40336' title='40336'>'Look at his long letters,' he said. </span>
<span sid='40337' title='40337'>'They hardly rise above the common herd. </span>
<span sid='40338' title='40338'>That d might be an a, and that l an e. </span>
<span sid='40339' title='40339'>Men of character always differentiate their long letters, however illegibly they may write. </span>
<span sid='40340' title='40340'>There is vacillation in his k's and self-esteem in his capitals. </span>
<span sid='40341' title='40341'>I am going out now. </span>
<span sid='40342' title='40342'>I have some few references to make. </span>
<span sid='40343' title='40343'>Let me recommend this book - one of the most remarkable ever penned. </span>
<span sid='40344' title='40344'>It is Winwood Reade Martyrdom of Man. </span>
<span sid='40345' title='40345'>I shall be back in an hour.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40346' title='40346'>I sat in the window with the volume in my hand, but my thoughts were far from the daring speculations of the writer. </span>
<span sid='40347' title='40347'>My mind ran upon our late visitor  - her smiles, the deep, rich tones of her voice, the strange mystery which overhung her life. </span>
<span sid='40348' title='40348'>If she were seventeen at the time of her father's disappearance she must be seven-and-twenty now - a sweet age, when youth has lost its self-consciousness and become a little sobered by experience. </span>
<span sid='40349' title='40349'>So I sat and mused, until such dangerous thoughts came into my head that I hurried away to my desk and plunged furiously into the latest treatise upon pathology. </span>
<span sid='40350' title='40350'>What was I, an Army surgeon with a weak leg and a weaker banking account, that I should dare to think of such things? </span>
<span sid='40351' title='40351'>She was a unit, a factor - nothing more. </span>
<span sid='40352' title='40352'>If my future were black, it was better surely to face it like a man than to attempt to brighten it by mere will-o'-the-wisps of the imagination.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40353' title='40353'>3. In Quest of a Solution</span>
<p>
<span sid='40354' title='40354'>It was half-past five before Holmes returned. </span>
<span sid='40355' title='40355'>He was bright, eager, and in excellent spirits, a mood which in his case alternated with fits of the blackest depression.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40356' title='40356'>'There is no great mystery in this matter,' he said, taking the cup of tea which I had poured out for him; 'the facts appear to admit of only one explanation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40357' title='40357'>'What! you have solved it already?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40358' title='40358'>'Well, that would be too much to say. </span>
<span sid='40359' title='40359'>I have discovered a suggestive fact, that is all. </span>
<span sid='40360' title='40360'>It is, however, very suggestive. </span>
<span sid='40361' title='40361'>The details are still to be added. </span>
<span sid='40362' title='40362'>I have just found, on consulting the back files of The Times, that Major Sholto, of Upper <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a>, late of the 34th <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bombay&t=h'>Bombay</a> Infantry, died upon the 28th of April, 1882.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40363' title='40363'>'I may be very obtuse, Holmes, but I fail to see what this suggests.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40364' title='40364'>'No? </span>
<span sid='40365' title='40365'>You surprise me. </span>
<span sid='40366' title='40366'>Look at it in this way, then. </span>
<span sid='40367' title='40367'>Captain Morstan disappears. </span>
<span sid='40368' title='40368'>The only person in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> whom he could have visited is Major Sholto. </span>
<span sid='40369' title='40369'>Major Sholto denies having heard that he was in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='40370' title='40370'>Four years later Sholto dies. </span>
<span sid='40371' title='40371'>Within a week of his death Captain Morstan's daughter receives a valuable present, which is repeated from year to year, and now culminates in a letter which describes her as a wronged woman. </span>
<span sid='40372' title='40372'>What wrong can it refer to except this deprivation of her father? </span>
<span sid='40373' title='40373'>And why should the presents begin immediately after Sholto's death, unless it is that Sholto's heir knows something of the mystery and desires to make compensation? </span>
<span sid='40374' title='40374'>Have you any alternative theory which will meet the facts?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40375' title='40375'>'But what a strange compensation! </span>
<span sid='40376' title='40376'>And how strangely made! </span>
<span sid='40377' title='40377'>Why, too, should he write a letter now, rather than six years ago? </span>
<span sid='40378' title='40378'>Again, the letter speaks of giving her justice. </span>
<span sid='40379' title='40379'>What justice can she have? </span>
<span sid='40380' title='40380'>It is too much to suppose that her father is still alive. </span>
<span sid='40381' title='40381'>There is no other injustice in her case that you know of.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40382' title='40382'>'There are difficulties; there are certainly difficulties,' said Sherlock Holmes, pensively; 'but our expedition of to-night will solve them all. </span>
<span sid='40383' title='40383'>Ah, here is a four-wheeler, and Miss Morstan inside. </span>
<span sid='40384' title='40384'>Are you all ready? </span>
<span sid='40385' title='40385'>Then we had better go down, for it is a little past the hour.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40386' title='40386'>I picked up my hat and my heaviest stick, but I observed that Holmes took his revolver from his drawer and slipped it into his pocket. </span>
<span sid='40387' title='40387'>It was clear that he thought that our night's work might be a serious one.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40388' title='40388'>Miss Morstan was muffled in a dark cloak, and her sensitive face was composed, but pale. </span>
<span sid='40389' title='40389'>She must have been more than woman if she did not feel some uneasiness at the strange enterprise upon which we were embarking, yet her self-control was perfect, and she readily answered the few additional questions which Sherlock Holmes put to her.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40390' title='40390'>'Major Sholto was a very particular friend of papa's,' she said. </span>
<span sid='40391' title='40391'>'His letters were full of allusions to the Major. </span>
<span sid='40392' title='40392'>He and papa were in command of the troops at the Andaman Islands, so they were thrown a great deal together. </span>
<span sid='40393' title='40393'>By the way, a curious paper was found in papa's desk which no one could understand. </span>
<span sid='40394' title='40394'>I don't suppose that it is of the slightest importance, but I thought you might care to see it, so I brought it with me. </span>
<span sid='40395' title='40395'>It is here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40396' title='40396'>Holmes unfolded the paper carefully and smoothed it out upon his knee. </span>
<span sid='40397' title='40397'>He then very methodically examined it all over with his double lens.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40398' title='40398'>'It is paper of native Indian manufacture,' he remarked. </span>
<span sid='40399' title='40399'>'It has at some time been pinned to a board. </span>
<span sid='40400' title='40400'>The diagram upon it appears to be a plan of part of a large building with numerous halls, corridors, and passages. </span>
<span sid='40401' title='40401'>At one point is a small cross done in red ink, and above it is "3.37 from left," in faded pencil-writing. </span>
<span sid='40402' title='40402'>In the left-hand corner is a curious hieroglyphic like four crosses in a line with their arms touching. </span>
<span sid='40403' title='40403'>Beside it is written, in very rough and coarse characters, "The sign of the four - Jonathan Small, Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan, Dost Akbar." </span>
<span sid='40404' title='40404'>No, I confess that I do not see how this bears upon the matter. </span>
<span sid='40405' title='40405'>Yet it is evidently a document of importance. </span>
<span sid='40406' title='40406'>It has been kept carefully in a pocket-book; for the one side is as clean as the other.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40407' title='40407'>'It was in his pocket-book that we found it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40408' title='40408'>'Preserve it carefully, then, Miss Morstan, for it may prove to be of use to us. </span>
<span sid='40409' title='40409'>I begin to suspect that this matter may turn out to be much deeper and more subtle than I at first supposed. </span>
<span sid='40410' title='40410'>I must reconsider my ideas.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40411' title='40411'>He leaned back in the cab, and I could see by his drawn brow and his vacant eye that he was thinking intently. </span>
<span sid='40412' title='40412'>Miss Morstan and I chatted in an undertone about our present expedition and its possible outcome, but our companion maintained his impenetrable reserve until the end of our journey.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40413' title='40413'>It was a September evening, and not yet seven o'clock, but the day had been a dreary one, and a dense drizzly fog lay low upon the great city. </span>
<span sid='40414' title='40414'>Mudcoloured clouds drooped sadly over the muddy streets. </span>
<span sid='40415' title='40415'>Down <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Strand&t=h'>the Strand</a> the lamps were but misty splotches of diffused light, which threw a feeble circular glimmer upon the slimy pavement. </span>
<span sid='40416' title='40416'>The yellow glare from the shop-windows streamed out into the steamy, vaporous air, and threw a murky, shifting radiance across the crowded thoroughfare. </span>
<span sid='40417' title='40417'>There was, to my mind, something eerie and ghost-like in the endless procession of faces which flitted across these narrow bars of light - sad faces and glad, haggard and merry. </span>
<span sid='40418' title='40418'>Like all human kind, they flitted from the gloom into the light, and so back into the gloom once more. </span>
<span sid='40419' title='40419'>I am not subject to impressions, but the dull, heavy evening, with the strange business upon which we were engaged, combined to make me nervous and depressed. </span>
<span sid='40420' title='40420'>I could see from Miss Morstan's manner that she was suffering from the same feeling. </span>
<span sid='40421' title='40421'>Holmes alone could rise superior to petty influences. </span>
<span sid='40422' title='40422'>He held his open note-book upon his knee, and from time to time he jotted down figures and memoranda in the light of his pocket-lantern.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40423' title='40423'>At the Lyceum Theatre the crowds were already thick at the side-entrances. </span>
<span sid='40424' title='40424'>In front a continuous stream of hansoms and four-wheelers were rattling up, discharging their cargoes of shirt-fronted men and beshawled, bediamonded women. </span>
<span sid='40425' title='40425'>We had hardly reached the third pillar, which was our rendezvous, before a small, dark, brisk man in the dress of a coachman accosted us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40426' title='40426'>'Are you the parties who come with Miss Morstan?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40427' title='40427'>'I am Miss Morstan, and these two gentlemen are my friends,' said she.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40428' title='40428'>He bent a pair of wonderfully penetrating and questioning eyes upon us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40429' title='40429'>'You will excuse me, miss,' he said, with a certain dogged manner, 'but I was to ask you to give me your word that neither of your companions is a police officer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40430' title='40430'>'I give you my word on that,' she answered. </span>
<span sid='40431' title='40431'>He gave a shrill whistle, on which a street arab led across a four-wheeler and opened the door. </span>
<span sid='40432' title='40432'>The man who had addressed us mounted to the box, while we took our places inside. </span>
<span sid='40433' title='40433'>We had hardly done so before the driver whipped up his horse, and we plunged away at a furious pace through the foggy streets.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40434' title='40434'>The situation was a curious one. </span>
<span sid='40435' title='40435'>We were driving to an unknown place, on an unknown errand. </span>
<span sid='40436' title='40436'>Yet our invitation was either a complete hoax - which was an inconceivable hypothesis - or else we had good reason to think that important issues might hang upon our journey. </span>
<span sid='40437' title='40437'>Miss Morstan's demeanour was as resolute and collected as ever. </span>
<span sid='40438' title='40438'>I endeavoured to cheer and amuse her by reminiscences of my adventures in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Afghanistan&t=h'>Afghanistan</a>; but, to tell the truth, I was myself so excited at our situation, and so curious as to our destination, that my stories were slightly involved. </span>
<span sid='40439' title='40439'>To this day she declares that I told her one moving anecdote as to how a musket looked into my tent at the dead of night, and how I fired a double-barrelled tiger cub at it. </span>
<span sid='40440' title='40440'>At first I had some idea as to the direction in which we were driving; but soon, what with our pace, the fog, and my own limited knowledge of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, I lost my bearings, and knew nothing, save that we seemed to be going a very long way. </span>
<span sid='40441' title='40441'>Sherlock Holmes was never at fault, however, and he muttered the names as the cab rattled through squares and in and out by tortuous by-streets.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40442' title='40442'>'Rochester Row,' said he. </span>
<span sid='40443' title='40443'>'Now Vincent Square. </span>
<span sid='40444' title='40444'>Now we come out on the Vauxhall Bridge Road. </span>
<span sid='40445' title='40445'>We are making for the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Surrey&t=h'>Surrey</a> side, apparently. </span>
<span sid='40446' title='40446'>Yes, I thought so. </span>
<span sid='40447' title='40447'>Now we are on the bridge. </span>
<span sid='40448' title='40448'>You can catch glimpses of the river.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40449' title='40449'>We did indeed get a fleeting view of a stretch of the Thames, with the lamps shining upon the broad, silent water; but our cab dashed on, and was soon involved in a labyrinth of streets upon the other side.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40450' title='40450'>'Wandsworth Road,' said my companion. </span>
<span sid='40451' title='40451'>'Priory Road. </span>
<span sid='40452' title='40452'>Larkhall Lane. </span>
<span sid='40453' title='40453'>Stockwell Place. </span>
<span sid='40454' title='40454'>Robert Street. </span>
<span sid='40455' title='40455'>Coldharbour Lane. </span>
<span sid='40456' title='40456'>Our quest does not appear to take us to very fashionable regions.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40457' title='40457'>We had indeed reached a questionable and forbidding neighbourhood. </span>
<span sid='40458' title='40458'>Long lines of dull brick houses were only relieved by the coarse glare and tawdry brilliancy of public-houses at the corners. </span>
<span sid='40459' title='40459'>Then came rows of two-storied villas, each with a fronting of miniature garden, and then again interminable lines of new, staring brick buildings - the monster tentacles which the giant city was throwing out into the country. </span>
<span sid='40460' title='40460'>At last the cab drew up at the third house in a new terrace. </span>
<span sid='40461' title='40461'>None of the other houses were inhabited, and that at which we stopped was as dark as its neighbours, save for a single glimmer in the kitchen-window. </span>
<span sid='40462' title='40462'>On our knocking, however, the door was instantly thrown open by a Hindu servant, clad in a yellow turban, white, loose-fitting clothes, and a yellow sash. </span>
<span sid='40463' title='40463'>There was something strangely incongruous in this Oriental figure framed in the commonplace doorway of a third-rate suburban dwelling-house.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40464' title='40464'>'The sahib awaits you,' said he, and even as he spoke there came a high, piping voice from some inner room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40465' title='40465'>'Show them in to me, khitmutgar,' it cried. </span>
<span sid='40466' title='40466'>'Show them straight in to me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40467' title='40467'>4. The Story of the Bald-headed Man</span>
<p>
<span sid='40468' title='40468'>We followed the Indian down a sordid and common passage, ill-lit and worse furnished, until he came to a door upon the right, which he threw open. </span>
<span sid='40469' title='40469'>A blaze of yellow light streamed out upon us, and in the centre of the glare there stood a small man with a very high head, a bristle of red hair all round the fringe of it, and a bald, shining scalp which shot out from among it like a mountain-peak from fir-trees. </span>
<span sid='40470' title='40470'>He writhed his hands together as he stood, and his features were in a perpetual jerk-now smiling, now scowling, but never for an instant in repose. </span>
<span sid='40471' title='40471'>Nature had given him a pendulous lip, and a too visible line of yellow and irregular teeth, which he strove feebly to conceal by constantly passing his hand over the lower part of his face. </span>
<span sid='40472' title='40472'>In spite of his obtrusive baldness, he gave the impression of youth. </span>
<span sid='40473' title='40473'>In point of fact, he had just turned his thirtieth year.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40474' title='40474'>'Your servant, Miss Morstan,' he kept repeating, in a thin, high voice. </span>
<span sid='40475' title='40475'>'Your servant, gentlemen. </span>
<span sid='40476' title='40476'>Pray step into my little sanctum. </span>
<span sid='40477' title='40477'>A small place, Miss, but furnished to my own liking. </span>
<span sid='40478' title='40478'>An oasis of art in the howling desert of South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40479' title='40479'>We were all astonished by the appearance of the apartment into which he invited us. </span>
<span sid='40480' title='40480'>In that sorry house it looked as out-of-place as a diamond of the first water in a setting of brass. </span>
<span sid='40481' title='40481'>The richest and glossiest of curtains and tapestries draped the walls, looped back here and there to expose some richly mounted painting or Oriental vase. </span>
<span sid='40482' title='40482'>The carpet was of amber and black, so soft and so thick that the foot sank pleasantly into it, as into a bed of moss. </span>
<span sid='40483' title='40483'>Two great tiger-skins thrown athwart it increased the suggestion of Eastern luxury, as did a huge hookah which stood upon a mat in the corner. </span>
<span sid='40484' title='40484'>A lamp in the fashion of a silver dove was hung from an almost invisible golden wire in the centre of the room. </span>
<span sid='40485' title='40485'>As it burned it filled the air with a subtle and aromatic odour.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40486' title='40486'>'Mr. Thaddeus Sholto,' said the little man, still jerking and smiling. </span>
<span sid='40487' title='40487'>'That is my name. </span>
<span sid='40488' title='40488'>You are Miss Morstan, of course. </span>
<span sid='40489' title='40489'>And these gentlemen-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40490' title='40490'>'This is Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and this Dr. Watson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40491' title='40491'>'A doctor, eh?' cried he, much excited. </span>
<span sid='40492' title='40492'>'Have you your stethoscope? </span>
<span sid='40493' title='40493'>Might I ask you - would you have the kindness? </span>
<span sid='40494' title='40494'>I have grave doubts as to my mitral valve, if you would be so very good. </span>
<span sid='40495' title='40495'>The aortic I may rely upon, but I should value your opinion upon the mitral.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40496' title='40496'>I listened to his heart, as requested, but was unable to find anything amiss, save, indeed, that he was in an ecstasy of fear, for he shivered from head to foot. </span>
<span sid='40497' title='40497'>'It appears to be normal,' I said. </span>
<span sid='40498' title='40498'>'You have no cause for uneasiness.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40499' title='40499'>'You will excuse my anxiety, Miss Morstan,' he remarked, airily. </span>
<span sid='40500' title='40500'>'I am a great sufferer, and I have long had suspicions as to that valve. </span>
<span sid='40501' title='40501'>I am delighted to hear that they are unwarranted. </span>
<span sid='40502' title='40502'>Had your father, Miss Morstan, refrained from throwing a strain upon his heart, he might have been alive now.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40503' title='40503'>I could have struck the man across the face, so hot was I at this callous and off-hand reference to so delicate a matter. </span>
<span sid='40504' title='40504'>Miss Morstan sat down, and her face grew white to the lips.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40505' title='40505'>'I knew in my heart that he was dead,' said she.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40506' title='40506'>'I can give you every information,' said he; 'and what is more, I can do you justice; and I will, too, whatever Brother Bartholomew may say. </span>
<span sid='40507' title='40507'>I am so glad to have your friends here, not only as an escort to you, but also as witnesses to what I am about to do and say. </span>
<span sid='40508' title='40508'>The three of us can show a bold front to Brother Bartholomew. </span>
<span sid='40509' title='40509'>But let us have no outsiders - no police or officials. </span>
<span sid='40510' title='40510'>We can settle everything satisfactorily among ourselves, without any interference. </span>
<span sid='40511' title='40511'>Nothing would annoy Brother Bartholomew more than any publicity.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40512' title='40512'>He sat down upon a low settee, and blinked at us inquiringly with his weak, watery blue eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40513' title='40513'>'For my part,' said Holmes, 'whatever you may choose to say will go no farther.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40514' title='40514'>I nodded to show my agreement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40515' title='40515'>'That is well! </span>
<span sid='40516' title='40516'>That is well!' said he. </span>
<span sid='40517' title='40517'>'May I offer you a glass of Chianti, Miss Morstan? </span>
<span sid='40518' title='40518'>Or of Tokay? </span>
<span sid='40519' title='40519'>I keep no other wines. </span>
<span sid='40520' title='40520'>Shall I open a flask? </span>
<span sid='40521' title='40521'>No? </span>
<span sid='40522' title='40522'>Well, then, I trust that you have no objection to tobacco smoke, to the balsamic odour of the Eastern tobacco. </span>
<span sid='40523' title='40523'>I am a little nervous, and I find my hookah an invaluable sedative.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40524' title='40524'>He applied a taper to the great bowl, and the smoke bubbled merrily through the rosewater. </span>
<span sid='40525' title='40525'>We sat all three in a semi-circle, with our heads advanced and our chins upon our hands, while the strange, jerky little fellow, with his high, shining head, puffed uneasily in the centre.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40526' title='40526'>'When I first determined to make this communication to you,' said he, 'I might have given you my address; but I feared that you might disregard my request and bring unpleasant people with you. </span>
<span sid='40527' title='40527'>I took the liberty, therefore, of making an appointment in such a way that my man Williams might be able to see you first. </span>
<span sid='40528' title='40528'>I have complete confidence in his discretion, and he had orders, if he were dissatisfied, to proceed no further in the matter. </span>
<span sid='40529' title='40529'>You will excuse these precautions, but I am a man of somewhat retiring, and I might even say refined, tastes, and there is nothing more unæsthetic than a policeman. </span>
<span sid='40530' title='40530'>I have a natural shrinking from all forms of rough materialism. </span>
<span sid='40531' title='40531'>I seldom come in contact with the rough crowd. </span>
<span sid='40532' title='40532'>I live, as you see, with some little atmosphere of elegance around me. </span>
<span sid='40533' title='40533'>I may call myself a patron of the arts. </span>
<span sid='40534' title='40534'>It is my weakness. </span>
<span sid='40535' title='40535'>The landscape is a genuine Corot, and, though a connoisseur might perhaps throw a doubt upon that Salvator Rosa, there cannot be the least question about the Bouguereau. </span>
<span sid='40536' title='40536'>I am partial to the modern French school.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40537' title='40537'>'You will excuse me, Mr. Sholto,' said Miss Morstan, 'but I am here at your request to learn something which you desire to tell me. </span>
<span sid='40538' title='40538'>It is very late, and I should desire the interview to be as short as possible.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40539' title='40539'>'At the best, it must take some time,' he answered; 'for we shall certainly have to go to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a> and see Brother Bartholomew. </span>
<span sid='40540' title='40540'>We shall all go and try if we can get the better of Brother Bartholomew. </span>
<span sid='40541' title='40541'>He is very angry with me for taking the course which has seemed right to me. </span>
<span sid='40542' title='40542'>I had quite high words with him last night. </span>
<span sid='40543' title='40543'>You cannot imagine what a terrible fellow he is when he is angry.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40544' title='40544'>'If we are to go to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a>, it would perhaps be as well to start at once,' I ventured to remark.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40545' title='40545'>He laughed until his ears were quite red.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40546' title='40546'>'That would hardly do,' he cried. </span>
<span sid='40547' title='40547'>'I don't know what he would say if I brought you in that sudden way. </span>
<span sid='40548' title='40548'>No, I must prepare you by showing you how we all stand to each other. </span>
<span sid='40549' title='40549'>In the first place, I must tell you that there are several points in the story of which I am myself ignorant. </span>
<span sid='40550' title='40550'>I can only lay the facts before you as far as I know them myself.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40551' title='40551'>'My father was, as you may have guessed, Major John Sholto, once of the Indian Army. </span>
<span sid='40552' title='40552'>He retired some eleven years ago, and came to live at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pondicherry&t=h'>Pondicherry</a> Lodge, in Upper <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a>. </span>
<span sid='40553' title='40553'>He had prospered in India, and brought back with him a considerable sum of money, a large collection of valuable curiosities, and a staff of native servants. </span>
<span sid='40554' title='40554'>With these advantages he bought himself a house, and lived in great luxury. </span>
<span sid='40555' title='40555'>My twin-brother Bartholomew and I were the only children.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40556' title='40556'>'I very well remember the sensation which was caused by the disappearance of Captain Morstan. </span>
<span sid='40557' title='40557'>We read the details in the papers, and knowing that he had been a friend of our father's, we discussed the case freely in his presence. </span>
<span sid='40558' title='40558'>He used to join in our speculations as to what could have happened. </span>
<span sid='40559' title='40559'>Never for an instant did we suspect that he had the whole secret hidden in his own breast, that of all men he alone knew the fate of Arthur Morstan.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40560' title='40560'>'We did know, however, that some mystery, some positive danger, overhung our father. </span>
<span sid='40561' title='40561'>He was very fearful of going out alone, and he always employed two prize-fighters to act as porters at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pondicherry&t=h'>Pondicherry</a> Lodge. </span>
<span sid='40562' title='40562'>Williams, who drove you to-night, was one of them. </span>
<span sid='40563' title='40563'>He was once light-weight champion of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>. </span>
<span sid='40564' title='40564'>Our father would never tell us what it was he feared, but he had a most marked aversion to men with wooden legs. </span>
<span sid='40565' title='40565'>On one occasion he actually fired his revolver at a wooden-legged man, who proved to be a harmless tradesman canvassing for orders. </span>
<span sid='40566' title='40566'>We had to pay a large sum to hush the matter up. </span>
<span sid='40567' title='40567'>My brother and I used to think this a mere whim of my father's; but events have since led us to change our opinion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40568' title='40568'>'Early in 1882 my father received a letter from India which was a great shock to him. </span>
<span sid='40569' title='40569'>He nearly fainted at the breakfast-table when he opened it, and from that day he sickened to his death. </span>
<span sid='40570' title='40570'>What was in the letter we could never discover, but I could see as he held it that it was short and written in a scrawling hand. </span>
<span sid='40571' title='40571'>He had suffered for years from an enlarged spleen, but he now became rapidly worse, and towards the end of April we were informed that he was beyond all hope, and that he wished to make a last communication to us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40572' title='40572'>'When we entered his room he was propped up with pillows and breathing heavily. </span>
<span sid='40573' title='40573'>He besought us to lock the door and to come upon either side of the bed. </span>
<span sid='40574' title='40574'>Then, grasping our hands, he made a remarkable statement to us, in a voice which was broken as much by emotion as by pain. </span>
<span sid='40575' title='40575'>I shall try and give it to you in his own very words.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40576' title='40576'>'"I have only one thing," he said, "which weighs upon my mind at this supreme moment. </span>
<span sid='40577' title='40577'>It is my treatment of poor Morstan's orphan. </span>
<span sid='40578' title='40578'>The cursed greed which has been my besetting sin through life has withheld from her the treasure, half at least of which should have been hers. </span>
<span sid='40579' title='40579'>And yet I have made no use of it myself, so blind and foolish a thing is avarice. </span>
<span sid='40580' title='40580'>The mere feeling of possession has been so dear to me that I could not bear to share it with another. </span>
<span sid='40581' title='40581'>See that chaplet tipped with pearls beside the quinine-bottle? </span>
<span sid='40582' title='40582'>Even that I could not bear to part with, although I had got it out with the design of sending it to her. </span>
<span sid='40583' title='40583'>You, my sons, will give her a fair share of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Agra&t=h'>Agra</a> treasure. </span>
<span sid='40584' title='40584'>But send her nothing-not even the chaplet - until I am gone. </span>
<span sid='40585' title='40585'>After all, men have been as bad as this and have recovered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40586' title='40586'>'"I will tell you how Morstan died," he continued. </span>
<span sid='40587' title='40587'>"He had suffered for years from a weak heart, but he concealed it from everyone. </span>
<span sid='40588' title='40588'>I alone knew it. </span>
<span sid='40589' title='40589'>When in India, he and I, through a remarkable chain of circumstances, came into possession of a considerable treasure. </span>
<span sid='40590' title='40590'>I brought it over to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, and on the night of Morstan's arrival he came straight over here to claim his share. </span>
<span sid='40591' title='40591'>He walked over from the station, and was admitted by my faithful old Lal Chowdar, who is now dead. </span>
<span sid='40592' title='40592'>Morstan and I had a difference of opinion as to the division of the treasure, and we came to heated words. </span>
<span sid='40593' title='40593'>Morstan had sprung out of his chair in a paroxysm of anger, when he suddenly pressed his hand to his side, his face turned a dusky hue, and he fell backwards, cutting his head against the corner of the treasure-chest. </span>
<span sid='40594' title='40594'>When I stooped over him I found, to my horror, that he was dead.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40595' title='40595'>'"For a long time I sat half distracted, wondering what I should do. </span>
<span sid='40596' title='40596'>My first impulse was, of course, to call for assistance; but I could not but recognize that there was every chance that I would be accused of his murder. </span>
<span sid='40597' title='40597'>His death at the moment of a quarrel, and the gash in his head, would be black against me. </span>
<span sid='40598' title='40598'>Again, an official inquiry could not be made without bringing out some facts about the treasure, which I was particularly anxious to keep secret. </span>
<span sid='40599' title='40599'>He had told me that no soul upon earth knew where he had gone. </span>
<span sid='40600' title='40600'>There seemed to be no necessity why any soul ever should know.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40601' title='40601'>'"I was still pondering over the matter, when, looking up, I saw my servant, Lal Chowdar, in the doorway. </span>
<span sid='40602' title='40602'>He stole in and bolted the door behind him. </span>
<span sid='40603' title='40603'>'Do not fear, sahib,' he said; 'no one need know that you have killed him. </span>
<span sid='40604' title='40604'>Let us hide him away, and who is the wiser?' </span>
<span sid='40605' title='40605'>'I did not kill him,' said I. </span>
<span sid='40606' title='40606'>Lal Chowdar shook his head and smiled. </span>
<span sid='40607' title='40607'>'I heard it all, sahib,' said he; 'I heard you quarrel, and I heard the blow. </span>
<span sid='40608' title='40608'>But my lips are sealed. </span>
<span sid='40609' title='40609'>All are asleep in the house. </span>
<span sid='40610' title='40610'>Let us put him away together.' </span>
<span sid='40611' title='40611'>That was enough to decide me. </span>
<span sid='40612' title='40612'>If my own servant could not believe my innocence, how could I hope to make it good before twelve foolish tradesmen in a jury-box? </span>
<span sid='40613' title='40613'>Lal Chowdar and I disposed of the body that night, and within a few days the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> papers were full of the mysterious disappearance of Captain Morstan. </span>
<span sid='40614' title='40614'>You will see from what I say that I can hardly be blamed in the matter. </span>
<span sid='40615' title='40615'>My fault lies in the fact that we concealed not only the body, but also the treasure, and that I have clung to Morstan's share as well as to my own. </span>
<span sid='40616' title='40616'>I wish you, therefore, to make restitution. </span>
<span sid='40617' title='40617'>Put your ears down to my mouth. </span>
<span sid='40618' title='40618'>The treasure is hidden in-"</span>
<p>
<span sid='40619' title='40619'>'At this instant a horrible change came over his expression; his eyes stared wildly, his jaw dropped, and he yelled, in a voice which I can never forget, "Keep him out! </span>
<span sid='40620' title='40620'>For Christ's sake, keep him out!" </span>
<span sid='40621' title='40621'>We both stared round at the window behind us upon which his gaze was fixed. </span>
<span sid='40622' title='40622'>A face was looking in at us out of the darkness. </span>
<span sid='40623' title='40623'>We could see the whitening of the nose where it was pressed against the glass. </span>
<span sid='40624' title='40624'>It was a bearded, hairy face, with wild, cruel eyes and an expression of concentrated malevolence. </span>
<span sid='40625' title='40625'>My brother and I rushed towards the window, but the man was gone. </span>
<span sid='40626' title='40626'>When we returned to my father, his head had dropped and his pulse had ceased to beat.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40627' title='40627'>'We searched the garden that night, but found no sign of the intruder, save that just under the window a single footmark was visible in the flower-bed. </span>
<span sid='40628' title='40628'>But for that one trace, we might have thought that our imaginations had conjured up that wild, fierce face. </span>
<span sid='40629' title='40629'>We soon, however, had another and a more striking proof that there were secret agencies at work all round us. </span>
<span sid='40630' title='40630'>The window of my father's room was found open in the morning, his cupboards and boxes had been rifled, and upon his chest was fixed a torn piece of paper, with the words, "The sign of the four," scrawled across it. </span>
<span sid='40631' title='40631'>What the phrase meant, or who our secret visitor may have been, we never knew. </span>
<span sid='40632' title='40632'>As far as we can judge, none of my father's property had been actually stolen, though everything had been turned out. </span>
<span sid='40633' title='40633'>My brother and I naturally associated this peculiar incident with the fear which haunted my father during his life; but it is still a complete mystery to us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40634' title='40634'>The little man stopped to relight his hookah, and puffed thoughtfully for a few moments. </span>
<span sid='40635' title='40635'>We had all sat absorbed, listening to his extraordinary narrative. </span>
<span sid='40636' title='40636'>At the short account of her father's death Miss Morstan had turned deadly white, and for a moment I feared that she was about to faint. </span>
<span sid='40637' title='40637'>She rallied, however, on drinking a glass of water which I quietly poured out for her from a Venetian carafe upon the side-table. </span>
<span sid='40638' title='40638'>Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair with an abstracted expression and the lids drawn low over his glittering eyes. </span>
<span sid='40639' title='40639'>As I glanced at him I could not but think how, on that very day, he had complained bitterly of the commonplaceness of life. </span>
<span sid='40640' title='40640'>Here at least was a problem which would tax his sagacity to the utmost. </span>
<span sid='40641' title='40641'>Mr. Thaddeus Sholto looked from one to the other of us with an obvious pride at the effect which his story had produced, and then continued, between the puffs of his overgrown pipe.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40642' title='40642'>'My brother and I,' said he, 'were, as you may imagine, much excited as to the treasure which my father had spoken of. </span>
<span sid='40643' title='40643'>For weeks and for months we dug and delved in every part of the garden without discovering its whereabouts. </span>
<span sid='40644' title='40644'>It was maddening to think that the hiding-place was on his very lips at the moment that he died. </span>
<span sid='40645' title='40645'>We could judge the splendour of the missing riches by the chaplet which he had taken out. </span>
<span sid='40646' title='40646'>Over this chaplet my brother Bartholomew and I had some little discussion. </span>
<span sid='40647' title='40647'>The pearls were evidently of great value, and he was averse to part with them, for, between friends, my brother was himself a little inclined to my father's fault. </span>
<span sid='40648' title='40648'>He thought, too, that if we parted with the chaplet it might give rise to gossip, and finally bring us into trouble. </span>
<span sid='40649' title='40649'>It was all that I could do to persuade him to let me find out Miss Morstan's address and send her a detached pearl at fixed intervals, so that at least she might never feel destitute.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40650' title='40650'>'It was a kindly thought,' said our companion, earnestly; 'it was extremely good of you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40651' title='40651'>The little man waved his hand deprecatingly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40652' title='40652'>'We were your trustees,' he said; 'that was the view which I took of it, though brother Bartholomew could not altogether see it in that light. </span>
<span sid='40653' title='40653'>We had plenty of money ourselves. </span>
<span sid='40654' title='40654'>I desired no more. </span>
<span sid='40655' title='40655'>Besides, it would have been such bad taste to have treated a young lady in so scurvy a fashion. </span>
<span sid='40656' title='40656'>"Le mauvais goût mène au crime." </span>
<span sid='40657' title='40657'>The French have a very neat way of putting these things. </span>
<span sid='40658' title='40658'>Our difference of opinion on this subject went so far that I thought it best to set up rooms for myself; so I left <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pondicherry&t=h'>Pondicherry</a> Lodge, taking the old khitmutgar and Williams with me. </span>
<span sid='40659' title='40659'>Yesterday, however, I learn that an event of extreme importance has occurred. </span>
<span sid='40660' title='40660'>The treasure has been discovered. </span>
<span sid='40661' title='40661'>I instantly communicated with Miss Morstan, and it only remains for us to drive out to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a> and demand our share. </span>
<span sid='40662' title='40662'>I explained my views last night to brother Bartholomew, so we shall be expected, if not welcome, visitors.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40663' title='40663'>Mr. Thaddeus Sholto ceased, and sat twitching on his luxurious settee. </span>
<span sid='40664' title='40664'>We all remained silent, with our thoughts upon the new development which the mysterious business had taken. </span>
<span sid='40665' title='40665'>Holmes was the first to spring to his feet.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40666' title='40666'>'You have done well, sir, from first to last,' said he. </span>
<span sid='40667' title='40667'>'It is possible that we may be able to make you some small return by throwing some light upon that which is still dark to you. </span>
<span sid='40668' title='40668'>But, as Miss Morstan remarked just now, it is late, and we had best put the matter through without delay.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40669' title='40669'>Our new acquaintance very deliberately coiled up the tube of his hookah, and produced from behind a curtain a very long, befrogged top-coat with astrakhan collar and cuffs. </span>
<span sid='40670' title='40670'>This he buttoned tightly up, in spite of the extreme closeness of the night, and finished his attire by putting on a rabbit-skin cap with hanging lappets which covered the ears, so that no part of him was visible save his mobile and peaky face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40671' title='40671'>'My health is somewhat fragile,' he remarked, as he led the way down the passage. </span>
<span sid='40672' title='40672'>'I am compelled to be a valetudinarian.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40673' title='40673'>Our cab was awaiting us outside, and our programme was evidently prearranged, for the driver started off at once at a rapid pace. </span>
<span sid='40674' title='40674'>Thaddeus Sholto talked incessantly, in a voice which rose high above the rattle of the wheels.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40675' title='40675'>'Bartholomew is a clever fellow,' said he. </span>
<span sid='40676' title='40676'>'How do you think he found out where the treasure was? </span>
<span sid='40677' title='40677'>He had come to the conclusion that it was somewhere indoors: so he worked out all the cubic space of the house, and made measurements everywhere, so that not one inch should be unaccounted for. </span>
<span sid='40678' title='40678'>Among other things, he found that the height of the building was seventy-four feet, but on adding together the heights of all the separate rooms, and making every allowance for the space between, which he ascertained by borings, he could not bring the total to more than seventy feet. </span>
<span sid='40679' title='40679'>There were four feet unaccounted for. </span>
<span sid='40680' title='40680'>These could only be at the top of the building. </span>
<span sid='40681' title='40681'>He knocked a hole, therefore, in the lath and plaster ceiling of the highest room, and there, sure enough, he came upon another little garret above it, which had been sealed up and was known to no one. </span>
<span sid='40682' title='40682'>In the centre stood the treasure-chest, resting upon two rafters. </span>
<span sid='40683' title='40683'>He lowered it through the hole, and there it lies. </span>
<span sid='40684' title='40684'>He computes the value of the jewels at not less than half a million sterling.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40685' title='40685'>At the mention of this gigantic sum we all stared at one another open-eyed. </span>
<span sid='40686' title='40686'>Miss Morstan, could we secure her rights, would change from a needy governess to the richest heiress in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>. </span>
<span sid='40687' title='40687'>Surely it was the place of a loyal friend to rejoice at such news; yet I am ashamed to say that selfishness took me by the soul, and that my heart turned as heavy as lead within me. </span>
<span sid='40688' title='40688'>I stammered out some few halting words of congratulation, and then sat downcast, with my head drooped, deaf to the babble of our new acquaintance. </span>
<span sid='40689' title='40689'>He was clearly a confirmed hypochondriac, and I was dreamily conscious that he was pouring forth interminable trains of symptoms, and imploring information as to the composition and action of innumerable quack nostrums, some of which he bore about in a leather case in his pocket. </span>
<span sid='40690' title='40690'>I trust that he may not remember any of the answers which I gave him that night. </span>
<span sid='40691' title='40691'>Holmes declares that he overheard me caution him against the great danger of taking more than two drops of castor-oil, while I recommended strychnine in large doses as a sedative. </span>
<span sid='40692' title='40692'>However that may be, I was certainly relieved when our cab pulled up with a jerk and the coachman sprang down to open the door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40693' title='40693'>'This, Miss Morstan, is <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pondicherry&t=h'>Pondicherry</a> Lodge,' said Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, as he handed her out.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40694' title='40694'>5. The Tragedy of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pondicherry&t=h'>Pondicherry</a> Lodge</span>
<p>
<span sid='40695' title='40695'>It was nearly eleven o'clock when we reached this final stage of our night's adventures. </span>
<span sid='40696' title='40696'>We had left the damp fog of the great city behind us, and the night was fairly fine. </span>
<span sid='40697' title='40697'>A warm wind blew from the westward, and heavy clouds moved slowly across the sky, with half a moon peeping occasionally through the rifts. </span>
<span sid='40698' title='40698'>It was clear enough to see for some distance, but Thaddeus Sholto took down one of the side-lamps from the carriage to give us a better light upon our way.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40699' title='40699'><a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pondicherry&t=h'>Pondicherry</a> Lodge stood in its own grounds, and was girt round with a very high stone wall topped with broken glass. </span>
<span sid='40700' title='40700'>A single narrow iron-clamped door formed the only means of entrance. </span>
<span sid='40701' title='40701'>On this our guide knocked with a peculiar postman-like rat-tat.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40702' title='40702'>'Who is there?' cried a gruff voice from within.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40703' title='40703'>'It is I, McMurdo. </span>
<span sid='40704' title='40704'>You surely know my knock by this time.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40705' title='40705'>There was a grumbling sound and a clanking and jarring of keys. </span>
<span sid='40706' title='40706'>The door swung heavily back, and a short, deep-chested man stood in the opening, with the yellow light of the lantern shining upon his protruded face and twinkling, distrustful eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40707' title='40707'>'That you, Mr. Thaddeus? </span>
<span sid='40708' title='40708'>But who are the others? </span>
<span sid='40709' title='40709'>I had no orders about them from the master.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40710' title='40710'>'No, McMurdo? </span>
<span sid='40711' title='40711'>You surprise me! </span>
<span sid='40712' title='40712'>I told my brother last night that I should bring some friends.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40713' title='40713'>'He hain't been out o' his room to-day, Mr. Thaddeus, and I have no orders. </span>
<span sid='40714' title='40714'>You know very well that I must stick to regulations. </span>
<span sid='40715' title='40715'>I can let you in, but your friends they must just stop where they are.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40716' title='40716'>This was an unexpected obstacle. </span>
<span sid='40717' title='40717'>Thaddeus Sholto looked about him in a perplexed and helpless manner.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40718' title='40718'>'This is too bad of you, McMurdo!' he said. </span>
<span sid='40719' title='40719'>'If I guarantee them, that is enough for you. </span>
<span sid='40720' title='40720'>There is the young lady, too. </span>
<span sid='40721' title='40721'>She cannot wait on the public road at this hour.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40722' title='40722'>'Very sorry, Mr. Thaddeus,' said the porter, inexorably. </span>
<span sid='40723' title='40723'>'Folk may be friends o' yours, and yet no friends o' the master's. </span>
<span sid='40724' title='40724'>He pays me well to do my duty, and my duty I'll do. </span>
<span sid='40725' title='40725'>I don't know none o' your friends.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40726' title='40726'>'Oh, yes, you do, McMurdo,' cried Sherlock Holmes, genially. </span>
<span sid='40727' title='40727'>'I don't think you can have forgotten me. </span>
<span sid='40728' title='40728'>Don't you remember the amateur who fought three rounds with you at Alison's rooms on the night of your benefit four years back?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40729' title='40729'>'Not Mr. Sherlock Holmes!' roared the prizefighter. </span>
<span sid='40730' title='40730'>'God's truth! how could I have mistook you? </span>
<span sid='40731' title='40731'>If instead o' standin' there so quiet you had just stepped up and given me that cross-hit of yours under the jaw, I'd ha' known you without a question. </span>
<span sid='40732' title='40732'>Ah, you're one that has wasted your gifts, you have! </span>
<span sid='40733' title='40733'>You might have aimed high, if you had joined the fancy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40734' title='40734'>'You see, Watson, if all else fails me, I have still one of the scientific professions open to me,' said Holmes, laughing. </span>
<span sid='40735' title='40735'>'Our friend won't keep us out in the cold now, I am sure.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40736' title='40736'>'In you come, sir, in you come - you and your friends,' he answered. </span>
<span sid='40737' title='40737'>'Very sorry, Mr. Thaddeus, but orders are very strict. </span>
<span sid='40738' title='40738'>Had to be certain of your friends before I let them in.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40739' title='40739'>Inside, a gravel path wound through desolate grounds to a huge clump of a house, square and prosaic, all plunged in shadow save where a moonbeam struck one corner and glimmered in a garret window. </span>
<span sid='40740' title='40740'>The vast size of the building, with its gloom and its deathly silence, struck a chill to the heart. </span>
<span sid='40741' title='40741'>Even Thaddeus Sholto seemed ill at ease, and the lantern quivered and rattled in his hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40742' title='40742'>'I cannot understand it,' he said. </span>
<span sid='40743' title='40743'>'There must be some mistake. </span>
<span sid='40744' title='40744'>I distinctly told Bartholomew that we shoold be here, and yet there is no light in his window. </span>
<span sid='40745' title='40745'>I do not know what to make of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40746' title='40746'>'Does he always guard the premises in this way?' asked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40747' title='40747'>'Yes, he has followed my father's custom. </span>
<span sid='40748' title='40748'>He was the favourite son, you know, and I sometimes think that my father may have told him more than he ever told me. </span>
<span sid='40749' title='40749'>That is Bartholomew's window up there where the moonshine strikes. </span>
<span sid='40750' title='40750'>It is quite bright, but there is no light from within, I think.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40751' title='40751'>'None,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='40752' title='40752'>'But I see the glint of a light in that little window beside the door.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40753' title='40753'>'Ah, that is the housekeeper's room. </span>
<span sid='40754' title='40754'>That is where old Mrs. Bernstone sits. </span>
<span sid='40755' title='40755'>She can tell us all about it. </span>
<span sid='40756' title='40756'>But perhaps you would not mind waiting here for a minute or two, for if we all go in together, and she has had no word of our coming, she may be alarmed. </span>
<span sid='40757' title='40757'>But, hush! what is that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40758' title='40758'>He held up the lantern, and his hand shook until the circles of light flickered and wavered all round us. </span>
<span sid='40759' title='40759'>Miss Morstan seized my wrist, and we all stood, with thumping hearts, straining our ears. </span>
<span sid='40760' title='40760'>From the great black house there sounded through the silent night the saddest and most pitiful of sounds - the shrill, broken whimpering of a frightened woman.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40761' title='40761'>'It is Mrs. Bernstone,' said Sholto. </span>
<span sid='40762' title='40762'>'She is the only woman in the house. </span>
<span sid='40763' title='40763'>Wait here. </span>
<span sid='40764' title='40764'>I shall be back in a moment.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40765' title='40765'>He hurried for the door, and knocked in his peculiar way. </span>
<span sid='40766' title='40766'>We could see a tall old woman admit him, and sway with pleasure at the very sight of him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40767' title='40767'>'Oh, Mr. Thaddeus, sir, I am so glad you have come! </span>
<span sid='40768' title='40768'>I am so glad you have come, Mr. Thaddeus, sir!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40769' title='40769'>We heard her reiterated rejoicings until the door was closed and her voice died away into a muffled monotone.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40770' title='40770'>Our guide had left us the lantern. </span>
<span sid='40771' title='40771'>Holmes swung it slowly round, and peered keenly at the house, and at the great rubbish-heaps which cumbered the grounds. </span>
<span sid='40772' title='40772'>Miss Morstan and I stood together, and her hand was in mine. </span>
<span sid='40773' title='40773'>A wondrous subtle thing is love, for here were we two, who had never seen each other before that day, between whom no word or even look of affection had ever passed, and yet now in an hour of trouble our hands instinctively sought for each other. </span>
<span sid='40774' title='40774'>I have marvelled at it since, but at the time it seemed the most natural thing that I should go out to her so, and, as she has often told me, there was in her also the instinct to turn to me for comfort and protection. </span>
<span sid='40775' title='40775'>So we stood hand-in-hand, like two children, and there was peace in our hearts for all the dark things that surrounded us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40776' title='40776'>'What a strange place!' she said, looking round.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40777' title='40777'>'It looks as though all the moles in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> had been let loose in it. </span>
<span sid='40778' title='40778'>I have seen something of the sort on the side of a hill near <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ballarat&t=h'>Ballarat</a>, where the prospectors had been at work.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40779' title='40779'>'And from the same cause,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='40780' title='40780'>'These are the traces of the treasure-seekers. </span>
<span sid='40781' title='40781'>You must remember that they were six years looking for it. </span>
<span sid='40782' title='40782'>No wonder that the grounds look like a gravel-pit.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40783' title='40783'>At that moment the door of the house burst open, and Thaddeus Sholto came running out, with his hands thrown forward and terror in his eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40784' title='40784'>'There is something amiss with Bartholomew!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='40785' title='40785'>'I am frightened! </span>
<span sid='40786' title='40786'>My nerves cannot stand it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40787' title='40787'>He was, indeed, half blubbering with fear, and his twitching, feeble face peeping out from the great astrakhan collar had the helpless, appealing expression of a terrified child.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40788' title='40788'>'Come into the house,' said Holmes, in his crisp, firm way.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40789' title='40789'>'Yes, do!' pleaded Thaddeus Sholto. </span>
<span sid='40790' title='40790'>'I really do not feel equal to giving directions.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40791' title='40791'>We all followed him into the housekeeper's room, which stood upon the left-hand side of the passage. </span>
<span sid='40792' title='40792'>The old woman was pacing up and down with a scared look and restless, picking fingers, but the sight of Miss Morstan appeared to have a soothing effect upon her.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40793' title='40793'>'God bless your sweet, calm face!' she cried, with an hysterical sob. </span>
<span sid='40794' title='40794'>'It does me good to see you. </span>
<span sid='40795' title='40795'>Oh, but I have been sorely tried this day!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40796' title='40796'>Our companion patted her thin, work-worn hand, and murmured some few words of kindly, womanly comfort, which brought the colour back into the other's bloodless cheeks.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40797' title='40797'>'Master has locked himself in, and will not answer me,' she explained. </span>
<span sid='40798' title='40798'>'All day I have waited to hear from him, for he often likes to be alone; but an hour ago I feared that something was amiss, so I went up and peeped through the keyhole. </span>
<span sid='40799' title='40799'>You must go up, Mr. Thaddeus - you must go up and look for yourself. </span>
<span sid='40800' title='40800'>I have seen Mr. Bartholomew Sholto, in joy and in sorrow for ten long years, but I never saw him with such a face on him as that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40801' title='40801'>Sherlock Holmes took the lamp and led the way, for Thaddeus Sholto's teeth were chattering in his head. </span>
<span sid='40802' title='40802'>So shaken was he that I had to pass my hand under his arm as we went up the stairs, for his knees were trembling under him. </span>
<span sid='40803' title='40803'>Twice as we ascended Holmes whipped his lens out of his pocket and carefully examined marks which appeared to me to be mere shapeless smudges of dust upon the coco-nutmatting which served as a stair-carpet. </span>
<span sid='40804' title='40804'>He walked slowly from step to step, holding the lamp low, and shooting keen glances to right and left. </span>
<span sid='40805' title='40805'>Miss Morstan had remained behind with the frightened housekeeper.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40806' title='40806'>The third flight of stairs ended in a straight passage of some length, with a great picture in Indian tapestry upon the right of it and three doors upon the left. </span>
<span sid='40807' title='40807'>Holmes advanced along it in the same slow and methodical way, while we kept close at his heels, with our long, black shadows streaming backwards down the corridor. </span>
<span sid='40808' title='40808'>The third door was that which we were seeking. </span>
<span sid='40809' title='40809'>Holmes knocked without receiving any answer, and then tried to turn the handle and force it open. </span>
<span sid='40810' title='40810'>It was locked on the inside, however, and by a broad and powerful bolt, as we could see when we set our lamp up against it. </span>
<span sid='40811' title='40811'>The key being turned, however, the hole was not entirely closed. </span>
<span sid='40812' title='40812'>Sherlock Holmes bent down to it, and instantly rose again with a sharp intaking of the breath.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40813' title='40813'>'There is something devilish in this, Watson,' said he, more moved than I had ever before seen him. </span>
<span sid='40814' title='40814'>'What do you make of it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40815' title='40815'>I stooped to the hole, and recoiled in horror. </span>
<span sid='40816' title='40816'>Moonlight was streaming into the room, and it was bright with a vague and shifty radiance. </span>
<span sid='40817' title='40817'>Looking straight at me, and suspended, as it were, in the air, for all beneath was in shadow, there hung a face - the very face of our companion Thaddeus. </span>
<span sid='40818' title='40818'>There was the same high, shining head, the same circular bristle of red hair, the same bloodless countenance. </span>
<span sid='40819' title='40819'>The features were set, however, in a horrible smile, a fixed and unnatural grin, which in that still and moonlit room was more jarring to the nerves than any scowl or contortion. </span>
<span sid='40820' title='40820'>So like was the face to that of our little friend that I looked round at him to make sure that he was indeed with us. </span>
<span sid='40821' title='40821'>Then I recalled to mind that he had mentioned to us that his brother and he were twins.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40822' title='40822'>'This is terrible!' I said to Holmes. </span>
<span sid='40823' title='40823'>'What is to be done?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40824' title='40824'>'The door must come down,' he answered, and, springing against it, he put all his weight upon the lock.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40825' title='40825'>It creaked and groaned, but did not yield. </span>
<span sid='40826' title='40826'>Together we flung ourselves upon it once more, and this time it gave way with a sudden snap, and we found ourselves within Bartholomew Sholto's chamber.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40827' title='40827'>It appeared to have been fitted up as a chemical laboratory. </span>
<span sid='40828' title='40828'>A double line of glass-stoppered bottles was drawn up upon the wall opposite the door, and the table was littered over with Bunsen burners, test-tubes, and retorts. </span>
<span sid='40829' title='40829'>In the corners stood carboys of acid in wicker baskets. </span>
<span sid='40830' title='40830'>One of these appeared to leak or to have been broken, for a stream of dark-coloured liquid had trickled out from it, and the air was heavy with a peculiarly pungent, tar-like odour. </span>
<span sid='40831' title='40831'>A set of steps stood at one side of the room, in the midst of a litter of lath and plaster, and above them there was an opening in the ceiling large enough for a man to pass through. </span>
<span sid='40832' title='40832'>At the foot of the steps a long coil of rope was thrown carelessly together.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40833' title='40833'>By the table, in a wooden arm-chair, the master of the house was seated all in a heap, with his head sunk upon his left shoulder, and that ghastly, inscrutable smile upon his face. </span>
<span sid='40834' title='40834'>He was stiff and cold, and had clearly been dead many hours. </span>
<span sid='40835' title='40835'>It seemed to me that not only his features, but all his limbs, were twisted and turned in the most fantastic fashion. </span>
<span sid='40836' title='40836'>By his hand upon the table there lay a peculiar instrument - a brown, close-grained stick, with a stone head like a hammer, rudely lashed on with coarse twine. </span>
<span sid='40837' title='40837'>Beside it was a torn sheet of note-paper with some words scrawled upon it. </span>
<span sid='40838' title='40838'>Holmes glanced at it, and then handed it to me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40839' title='40839'>'You see,' he said, with a significant raising of the eyebrows.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40840' title='40840'>In the light of the lantern I read, with a thrill of horror, 'The sign of the four.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40841' title='40841'>'In God's name, what does it all mean?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40842' title='40842'>'It means murder,' said he, stooping over the dead man. </span>
<span sid='40843' title='40843'>'Ah, I expected it. </span>
<span sid='40844' title='40844'>Look here!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40845' title='40845'>He pointed to what looked like a long, dark thorn stuck in the skin just above the ear.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40846' title='40846'>'It looks like a thorn,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40847' title='40847'>'It is a thorn. </span>
<span sid='40848' title='40848'>You may pick it out. </span>
<span sid='40849' title='40849'>But be careful, for it is poisoned.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40850' title='40850'>I took it up between my finger and thumb. </span>
<span sid='40851' title='40851'>It came away from the skin so readily that hardly any mark was left behind. </span>
<span sid='40852' title='40852'>One tiny speck of blood showed where the puncture had been.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40853' title='40853'>'This is all an insoluble mystery to me,' said I. </span>
<span sid='40854' title='40854'>'It grows darker instead of clearer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40855' title='40855'>'On the contrary,' he answered, 'it clears every instant. </span>
<span sid='40856' title='40856'>I only require a few missing links to have an entirely connected case.' </span>
<span sid='40857' title='40857'>We had almost forgotten our companion's presence since we entered the chamber. </span>
<span sid='40858' title='40858'>He was still standing in the doorway, the very picture of terror, wringing his hands and moaning to himself. </span>
<span sid='40859' title='40859'>Suddenly, however, he broke out into a sharp, querulous cry. </span>
<span sid='40860' title='40860'>'The treasure is gone!' he said. </span>
<span sid='40861' title='40861'>'They have robbed him of the treasure! </span>
<span sid='40862' title='40862'>There is the hole through which we lowered it. </span>
<span sid='40863' title='40863'>I helped him to do it! </span>
<span sid='40864' title='40864'>I was the last person who saw him! </span>
<span sid='40865' title='40865'>I left him here last night, and I heard him lock the door as I came downstairs.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40866' title='40866'>'What time was that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40867' title='40867'>'It was ten o'clock. </span>
<span sid='40868' title='40868'>And now he is dead, and the police will be called in, and I shall be suspected of having had a hand in it. </span>
<span sid='40869' title='40869'>Oh, yes, I am sure I shall. </span>
<span sid='40870' title='40870'>But you don't think so, gentlemen? </span>
<span sid='40871' title='40871'>Surely, you don't think that it was I? </span>
<span sid='40872' title='40872'>Is it likely that I would have brought you here if it were I? </span>
<span sid='40873' title='40873'>Oh, dear! oh, dear! </span>
<span sid='40874' title='40874'>I know that I shall go mad!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40875' title='40875'>He jerked his arms and stamped his feet in a kind of convulsive frenzy.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40876' title='40876'>'You have no reason for fear, Mr. Sholto,' said Holmes, kindly, putting his hand upon his shoulder; 'take my advice, and drive down to the station to report the matter to the police. </span>
<span sid='40877' title='40877'>Offer to assist them in every way. </span>
<span sid='40878' title='40878'>We shall wait here until your return.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40879' title='40879'>The little man obeyed in a half-stupefied fashion, and we heard him stumbling down the stairs in the dark.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40880' title='40880'>6. Sherlock Holmes Gives a Demonstration</span>
<p>
<span sid='40881' title='40881'>'Now, Watson,' said Holmes, rubbing his hands, 'we have half an hour to ourselves. </span>
<span sid='40882' title='40882'>Let us make good use of it. </span>
<span sid='40883' title='40883'>My case is, as I have told you, almost complete; but we must not err on the side of over-confidence. </span>
<span sid='40884' title='40884'>Simple as the case seems now, there may be something deeper underlying it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40885' title='40885'>'Simple!' I ejaculated.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40886' title='40886'>'Surely,' said he, with something of the air of a clinical professor expounding to his class. </span>
<span sid='40887' title='40887'>'Just sit in the corner there, that your footprints may not complicate matters. </span>
<span sid='40888' title='40888'>Now to work! </span>
<span sid='40889' title='40889'>In the first place, how did these folk come, and how did they go? </span>
<span sid='40890' title='40890'>The door has not been opened since last night. </span>
<span sid='40891' title='40891'>How of the window?' </span>
<span sid='40892' title='40892'>He carried the lamp across to it, muttering his observations aloud the while, but addressing them to himself rather than to me. </span>
<span sid='40893' title='40893'>'Window is snibbed on the inner side. </span>
<span sid='40894' title='40894'>Framework is solid. </span>
<span sid='40895' title='40895'>No hinges at the side. </span>
<span sid='40896' title='40896'>Let us open it. </span>
<span sid='40897' title='40897'>No water-pipe near. </span>
<span sid='40898' title='40898'>Roof quite out of reach. </span>
<span sid='40899' title='40899'>Yet a man has mounted by the window. </span>
<span sid='40900' title='40900'>It rained a little last night. </span>
<span sid='40901' title='40901'>Here is the print of a foot in mould upon the sill. </span>
<span sid='40902' title='40902'>And here is a circular muddy mark, and here again upon the floor, and here again by the table. </span>
<span sid='40903' title='40903'>See here, Watson! </span>
<span sid='40904' title='40904'>This is really a very pretty demonstration.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40905' title='40905'>I looked at the round, well-defined muddy disks.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40906' title='40906'>'That is not a footmark,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40907' title='40907'>'It is something much more valuable to us. </span>
<span sid='40908' title='40908'>It is the impression of a wooden stump. </span>
<span sid='40909' title='40909'>You see here on the sill is the boot-mark, a heavy boot with a broad metal heel, and beside it is the mark of the timber-toe.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40910' title='40910'>'It is the wooden-legged man.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40911' title='40911'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='40912' title='40912'>But there has been someone else - a very able and efficient ally. </span>
<span sid='40913' title='40913'>Could you scale that wall, doctor?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40914' title='40914'>I looked out of the open window. </span>
<span sid='40915' title='40915'>The moon still shone brightly on that angle of the house. </span>
<span sid='40916' title='40916'>We were a good sixty feet from the ground, and, look where I would, I could see no foothold, nor as much as a crevice in the brickwork.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40917' title='40917'>'It is absolutely impossible,' I answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40918' title='40918'>'Without aid it is so. </span>
<span sid='40919' title='40919'>But suppose you had a friend up here who lowered you this good stout rope which I see in the corner, securing one end of it to this great hook in the wall. </span>
<span sid='40920' title='40920'>Then, I think, if you were an active man, you might swarm up, wooden leg and all. </span>
<span sid='40921' title='40921'>You would depart, of course, in the same fashion, and your ally would draw up the rope, untie it from the hook, shut the window, snib it on the inside, and get away in the way that he originally came. </span>
<span sid='40922' title='40922'>As a minor point, it may be noted,' he continued, fingering the rope, 'that our wooden-legged friend, though a fair climber, was not a professional sailor. </span>
<span sid='40923' title='40923'>His hands were far from horny. </span>
<span sid='40924' title='40924'>My lens discloses more than one blood-mark, especially towards the end of the rope, from which I gather that he slipped down with such velocity that he took the skin off his hand.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40925' title='40925'>'This is all very well,' said I; 'but the thing becomes more unintelligible than ever. </span>
<span sid='40926' title='40926'>How about this mysterious ally? </span>
<span sid='40927' title='40927'>How came he into the room?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40928' title='40928'>'Yes, the ally!' repeated Holmes, pensively. </span>
<span sid='40929' title='40929'>'There are features of interest about this ally. </span>
<span sid='40930' title='40930'>He lifts the case from the regions of the commonplace. </span>
<span sid='40931' title='40931'>I fancy that this ally breaks fresh ground in the annals of crime in this country - though parallel cases suggest themselves from India, and, if my memory serves me, from Senegambia.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40932' title='40932'>'How came he, then?' </span>
<span sid='40933' title='40933'>I reiterated. </span>
<span sid='40934' title='40934'>'The door is locked; the window is inaccessible. </span>
<span sid='40935' title='40935'>Was it through the chimney?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40936' title='40936'>'The grate is much too small,' he answered. </span>
<span sid='40937' title='40937'>'I had already considered that possibility.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40938' title='40938'>'How, then?' </span>
<span sid='40939' title='40939'>I persisted.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40940' title='40940'>'You will not apply my precept,' he said, shaking his head. </span>
<span sid='40941' title='40941'>'How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth? </span>
<span sid='40942' title='40942'>We know that he did not come through the door, the window, or the chimney. </span>
<span sid='40943' title='40943'>We also know that he could not have been concealed in the room, as there is no concealment possible. </span>
<span sid='40944' title='40944'>Whence, then, did he come?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40945' title='40945'>'He came through the hole in the roof!' I cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40946' title='40946'>'Of course he did. </span>
<span sid='40947' title='40947'>He must have done so. </span>
<span sid='40948' title='40948'>If you will have the kindness to hold the lamp for me, we shall now extend our researches to the room above-the secret room in which the treasure was found.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40949' title='40949'>He mounted the steps, and, seizing a rafter with either hand, he swung himself up into the garret. </span>
<span sid='40950' title='40950'>Then, lying on his face, he reached down for the lamp, and held it while I followed him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40951' title='40951'>The chamber in which we found ourselves was about ten feet one way and six the other. </span>
<span sid='40952' title='40952'>The floor was formed by the rafters, with thin lath-and-plaster between, so that in walking one had to step from beam to beam. </span>
<span sid='40953' title='40953'>The roof ran up to an apex, and was evidently the inner shell of the true roof of the house. </span>
<span sid='40954' title='40954'>There was no furniture of any sort, and the accumulated dust of years lay thick upon the floor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40955' title='40955'>'Here you are, you see,' said Sherlock Holmes, putting his hand against the sloping wall. </span>
<span sid='40956' title='40956'>'This is a trapdoor which leads out on to the roof. </span>
<span sid='40957' title='40957'>I can press it back, and here is the roof itself, sloping at a gentle angle. </span>
<span sid='40958' title='40958'>This, then, is the way by which Number One entered. </span>
<span sid='40959' title='40959'>Let us see if we can find some other traces of his individuality?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40960' title='40960'>He held down the lamp to the floor, and as he did so I saw for the second time that night a startled, surprised look come over his face. </span>
<span sid='40961' title='40961'>For myself, as I followed his gaze, my skin was cold under my clothes. </span>
<span sid='40962' title='40962'>The floor was covered thickly with the prints of a naked foot - clear, well-defined, perfectly formed, but scarce half the size of those of an ordinary man.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40963' title='40963'>' Holmes,' I said, in a whisper, 'a child has done this horrid thing.' </span>
<span sid='40964' title='40964'>He had recovered his self-possession in an instant.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40965' title='40965'>'I was staggered for the moment,' he said, 'but the thing is quite natural. </span>
<span sid='40966' title='40966'>My memory failed me, or I should have been able to foretell it. </span>
<span sid='40967' title='40967'>There is nothing more to be learned here. </span>
<span sid='40968' title='40968'>Let us go down.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40969' title='40969'>'What is your theory, then, as to those footmarks?' I asked, eagerly, when we had regained the lower room once more.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40970' title='40970'>'My dear Watson, try a little analysis yourself,' said he, with a touch of impatience. </span>
<span sid='40971' title='40971'>'You know my methods. </span>
<span sid='40972' title='40972'>Apply them, and it will be instructive to compare results.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40973' title='40973'>'I cannot conceive anything which will cover the facts,' I answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40974' title='40974'>'It will be clear enough to you soon,' he said, in an offhand way. </span>
<span sid='40975' title='40975'>'I think that there is nothing else of importance here, but I will look.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40976' title='40976'>He whipped out his lens and a tape measure, and hurried about the room on his knees, measuring, comparing, examining, with his long, thin nose only a few inches from the planks, and his beady eyes gleaming and deep-set like those of a bird. </span>
<span sid='40977' title='40977'>So swift, silent, and furtive were his movements, like those of a trained bloodhound picking out a scent, that I could not but think what a terrible criminal he would have made had he turned his energy and sagacity against the law instead of exerting them in its defence. </span>
<span sid='40978' title='40978'>As he hunted about he kept muttering to himself, and finally he broke out into a loud crow of delight.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40979' title='40979'>'We are certainly in luck,' said he. </span>
<span sid='40980' title='40980'>'We ought to have very little trouble now. </span>
<span sid='40981' title='40981'>Number One has had the misfortune to tread in the creosote. </span>
<span sid='40982' title='40982'>You can see the outline of the edge of his small foot here at the side of this evil-smelling mess. </span>
<span sid='40983' title='40983'>The carboy has been cracked, you see, and the stuff has leaked out.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40984' title='40984'>'What then?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40985' title='40985'>'Why, we have got him, that's all,' said he. </span>
<span sid='40986' title='40986'>'I know a dog that would follow that scent to the world's end. </span>
<span sid='40987' title='40987'>If a pack can track a trailed herring across a shire, how far can a specially-trained hound follow so pungent a smell as this? </span>
<span sid='40988' title='40988'>It sounds like a sum in the rule of three. </span>
<span sid='40989' title='40989'>The answer should give us the - But, halloa! here are the accredited representatives of the law.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40990' title='40990'>Heavy steps and the clamour of loud voices were audible from below, and the hall door shut with a loud crash.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40991' title='40991'>'Before they come,' said Holmes, 'just put your hand here on this poor fellow's arm, and here on his leg. </span>
<span sid='40992' title='40992'>What do you feel?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40993' title='40993'>'The muscles are as hard as a board,' I answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='40994' title='40994'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='40995' title='40995'>They are in a state of extreme contraction, far exceeding the usual rigor mortis. </span>
<span sid='40996' title='40996'>Coupled with this distortion of the face, this Hippocratic smile, or "risus sardonicus," as the old writers called it, what conclusion would it suggest to your mind?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40997' title='40997'>'Death from some powerful vegetable alkaloid,' I answered, 'some strychnine-like substance which would produce tetanus.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='40998' title='40998'>'That was the idea which occurred to me the instant I saw the drawn muscles of the face. </span>
<span sid='40999' title='40999'>On getting into the room I at once looked for the means by which the poison had entered the system. </span>
<span sid='41000' title='41000'>As you saw, I discovered a thorn which had been driven or shot with no great force into the scalp. </span>
<span sid='41001' title='41001'>You observe that the part struck was that which would be turned towards the hole in the ceiling if the man were erect in his chair. </span>
<span sid='41002' title='41002'>Now examine this thorn.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41003' title='41003'>I took it up gingerly and held it in the light of the lantern. </span>
<span sid='41004' title='41004'>It was long, sharp, and black, with a glazed look near the point as though some gummy substance had dried upon it. </span>
<span sid='41005' title='41005'>The blunt end had been trimmed and rounded off with a knife.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41006' title='41006'>'Is that an English thorn?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41007' title='41007'>'No, it certainly is not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41008' title='41008'>'With all these data you should be able to draw some just inference. </span>
<span sid='41009' title='41009'>But here are the regulars; so the auxiliary forces may beat a retreat.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41010' title='41010'>As he spoke, the steps which had been coming nearer sounded loudly on the passage, and a very stout, portly man in a grey suit strode heavily into the room. </span>
<span sid='41011' title='41011'>He was red-faced, burly, and plethoric, with a pair of very small, twinkling eyes, which looked keenly out from between swollen and puffy pouches. </span>
<span sid='41012' title='41012'>He was closely followed by an inspector in uniform, and by the still palpitating Thaddeus Sholto.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41013' title='41013'>'Here's a business!' he cried, in a muffled, husky voice. </span>
<span sid='41014' title='41014'>'Here's a pretty business! </span>
<span sid='41015' title='41015'>But who are all these? </span>
<span sid='41016' title='41016'>Why, the house seems to be as full as a rabbit-warren!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41017' title='41017'>'I think you must recollect me, Mr. Athelney Jones,' said Holmes, quietly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41018' title='41018'>'Why, of course I do!' he wheezed. </span>
<span sid='41019' title='41019'>'It's Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the theorist. </span>
<span sid='41020' title='41020'>Remember you! </span>
<span sid='41021' title='41021'>I'll never forget how you lectured us all on causes and inferences and effects in the Bishopgate jewel case. </span>
<span sid='41022' title='41022'>It's true you set us on the right track; but you'll own now that it was more by good luck than good guidance.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41023' title='41023'>'It was a piece of very simple reasoning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41024' title='41024'>'Oh, come, now, come! </span>
<span sid='41025' title='41025'>Never be ashamed to own up. </span>
<span sid='41026' title='41026'>But what is all this? </span>
<span sid='41027' title='41027'>Bad business! </span>
<span sid='41028' title='41028'>Bad business! </span>
<span sid='41029' title='41029'>Stern facts here - no room for theories. </span>
<span sid='41030' title='41030'>How lucky that I happened to be out at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a> over another case! </span>
<span sid='41031' title='41031'>I was at the station when the message arrived. </span>
<span sid='41032' title='41032'>What d'you think the man died of?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41033' title='41033'>'Oh, this is hardly a case for me to theorize over,' said Holmes, drily.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41034' title='41034'>'No, no. </span>
<span sid='41035' title='41035'>Still, we can't deny that you hit the nail on the head sometimes. </span>
<span sid='41036' title='41036'>Dear me! </span>
<span sid='41037' title='41037'>Door locked, I understand. </span>
<span sid='41038' title='41038'>Jewels worth half a million missing. </span>
<span sid='41039' title='41039'>How was the window?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41040' title='41040'>'Fastened; but there are steps on the sill.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41041' title='41041'>'Well, well, if it was fastened the steps could have nothing to do with the matter. </span>
<span sid='41042' title='41042'>That's common-sense. </span>
<span sid='41043' title='41043'>Man might have died in a fit; but then the jewels are missing. </span>
<span sid='41044' title='41044'>Ha! </span>
<span sid='41045' title='41045'>I have a theory. </span>
<span sid='41046' title='41046'>These flashes come upon me at times. </span>
<span sid='41047' title='41047'>- Just step outside sergeant, and you, Mr. Sholto. </span>
<span sid='41048' title='41048'>Your friend can remain. </span>
<span sid='41049' title='41049'>What do you think of this, Holmes? </span>
<span sid='41050' title='41050'>Sholto was, on his own confession, with his brother last night. </span>
<span sid='41051' title='41051'>The brother died in a fit, on which Sholto walked off with the treasure! </span>
<span sid='41052' title='41052'>How's that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41053' title='41053'>'On which the dead man very considerately got up and locked the door on the inside.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41054' title='41054'>'Hum! </span>
<span sid='41055' title='41055'>There's a flaw there. </span>
<span sid='41056' title='41056'>Let us apply common sense to the matter. </span>
<span sid='41057' title='41057'>This Thaddeus Sholto was with his brother; there was a quarrel: so much we know. </span>
<span sid='41058' title='41058'>The brother is dead and the jewels are gone. </span>
<span sid='41059' title='41059'>So much also we know. </span>
<span sid='41060' title='41060'>No one saw the brother from the time Thaddeus left him. </span>
<span sid='41061' title='41061'>His bed had not been slept in. </span>
<span sid='41062' title='41062'>Thaddeus is evidently in a most disturbed state of mind. </span>
<span sid='41063' title='41063'>His appearance is - well, not attractive. </span>
<span sid='41064' title='41064'>You see that I am weaving my web round Thaddeus. </span>
<span sid='41065' title='41065'>The net begins to close upon him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41066' title='41066'>'You are not quite in possession of the facts yet,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='41067' title='41067'>'This splinter of wood, which I have every reason to believe to be poisoned, was in the man's scalp where you still see the mark; this card, inscribed as you see it, was on the table, and beside it lay this rather curious stone-headed instrument. </span>
<span sid='41068' title='41068'>How does all that fit into your theory?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41069' title='41069'>'Confirms it in every respect,' said the fat detective, pompously. </span>
<span sid='41070' title='41070'>'House is full of Indian curiosities. </span>
<span sid='41071' title='41071'>Thaddeus brought this up, and if this splinter be poisonous, Thaddeus may as well have made murderous use of it as any other man. </span>
<span sid='41072' title='41072'>The card is some hocus-pocus  - a blind, as like as not. </span>
<span sid='41073' title='41073'>The only question is, how did he depart? </span>
<span sid='41074' title='41074'>Ah, of course, here is a hole in the roof.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41075' title='41075'>With great activity, considering his bulk, he sprang up the steps and squeezed through into the garret, and immediately afterwards we heard his exulting voice proclaiming that he had found the trap-door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41076' title='41076'>'He can find something,' remarked Holmes, shrugging his shoulders; 'he has occasional glimmerings of reason. </span>
<span sid='41077' title='41077'>Il n'y a pas des sots si incommodes que ceux qui ont de l'esprit!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41078' title='41078'>'You see!' said Athelney Jones, reappearing down the steps again; 'facts are better than theories, after all. </span>
<span sid='41079' title='41079'>My view of the case is confirmed. </span>
<span sid='41080' title='41080'>There is a trapdoor communicating with the roof, and it is partly open.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41081' title='41081'>'It was I who opened it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41082' title='41082'>'Oh, indeed! </span>
<span sid='41083' title='41083'>You did notice it, then?' </span>
<span sid='41084' title='41084'>He seemed a little crestfallen at the discovery. </span>
<span sid='41085' title='41085'>'Well, whoever noticed it, it shows how our gentleman got away. </span>
<span sid='41086' title='41086'>Inspector!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41087' title='41087'>'Yes, sir,' from the passage.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41088' title='41088'>'Ask Mr. Sholto to step this way. </span>
<span sid='41089' title='41089'>- Mr. Sholto, it is my duty to inform you that anything which you may say will be used against you. </span>
<span sid='41090' title='41090'>I arrest you in the Queen's name as being concerned in the death of your brother.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41091' title='41091'>'There, now! </span>
<span sid='41092' title='41092'>Didn't I tell you?' cried the poor little man, throwing out his hands, and looking from one to the other of us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41093' title='41093'>'Don't trouble yourself about it, Mr. Sholto,' said Holmes; 'I think that I can engage to clear you of the charge.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41094' title='41094'>'Don't promise too much, Mr. Theorist, don't promise too much!' </span>
<span sid='41095' title='41095'>snapped the detective. </span>
<span sid='41096' title='41096'>'You may find it a harder matter than you think.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41097' title='41097'>'Not only will I clear him, Mr. Jones, but I will make you a free present of the name and description of one of the two people who were in this room last night. </span>
<span sid='41098' title='41098'>His name, I have every reason to believe, is Jonathan Small. </span>
<span sid='41099' title='41099'>He is a poorly educated man, small, active, with his right leg off, and wearing a wooden stump which is worn away upon the inner side. </span>
<span sid='41100' title='41100'>His left boot has a coarse, square-toed sole, with an iron band round the heel. </span>
<span sid='41101' title='41101'>He is a middle-aged man, much sunburned, and has been a convict. </span>
<span sid='41102' title='41102'>These few indications may be of some assistance to you, coupled with the fact that there is a good deal of skin missing from the palm of his hand. </span>
<span sid='41103' title='41103'>The other man-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41104' title='41104'>'Ah! </span>
<span sid='41105' title='41105'>the other man?' asked Athelney Jones, in a sneering voice, but impressed none the less, as I could easily see, by the precision of the other's manner.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41106' title='41106'>'Is a rather curious person,' said Sherlock Holmes, turning upon his heel. </span>
<span sid='41107' title='41107'>'I hope before very long to be able to introduce you to the pair of them. </span>
<span sid='41108' title='41108'>A word with you, Watson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41109' title='41109'>He led me out to the head of the stair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41110' title='41110'>'This unexpected occurrence,' he said, 'has caused us rather to lose sight of the original purpose of our journey.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41111' title='41111'>'I have just been thinking so,' I answered; 'it is not right that Miss Morstan should remain in this stricken house.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41112' title='41112'>'No. </span>
<span sid='41113' title='41113'>You must escort her home. </span>
<span sid='41114' title='41114'>She lives with Mrs. Cecil Forrester, in Lower <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Camberwell&t=h'>Camberwell</a>, so it is not very far. </span>
<span sid='41115' title='41115'>I will wait for you here if you will drive out again. </span>
<span sid='41116' title='41116'>Or perhaps you are too tired?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41117' title='41117'>'By no means. </span>
<span sid='41118' title='41118'>I don't think I could rest until I know more of this fantastic business. </span>
<span sid='41119' title='41119'>I have seen something of the rough side of life, but I give you my word that this quick succession of strange surprises to-night has shaken my nerve completely. </span>
<span sid='41120' title='41120'>I should like, however, to see the matter through with you, now that I have got so far.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41121' title='41121'>'Your presence will be of great service to me,' he answered. </span>
<span sid='41122' title='41122'>'We shall work the case out independently, and leave this fellow Jones to exult over any mare's-nest which he may choose to construct. </span>
<span sid='41123' title='41123'>When you have dropped Miss Morstan, I wish you to go to No. 3, Pinchin Lane, down near the water's edge at Lambeth. </span>
<span sid='41124' title='41124'>The third house on the right-hand side is a bird-stuffer's; Sherman is the name. </span>
<span sid='41125' title='41125'>You will see a weasel holding a young rabbit in the window. </span>
<span sid='41126' title='41126'>Knock old Sherman up, and tell him, with my compliments, that I want Toby at once. </span>
<span sid='41127' title='41127'>You will bring Toby back in the cab with you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41128' title='41128'>'A dog, I suppose?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41129' title='41129'>'Yes, a queer mongrel, with a most amazing power of scent. </span>
<span sid='41130' title='41130'>I would rather have Toby's help than that of the whole detective force of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41131' title='41131'>'I shall bring him then,' said I. </span>
<span sid='41132' title='41132'>'It is one now. </span>
<span sid='41133' title='41133'>I ought to be back before three, if I can get a fresh horse.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41134' title='41134'>'And I,' said Holmes, 'shall see what I can learn from Mrs. Bernstone, and from the Indian servant, who, Mr. Thaddeus tells me, sleeps in the next garret. </span>
<span sid='41135' title='41135'>Then I shall study the great Jones's methods and listen to his not too delicate sarcasms. </span>

<p>
<span sid='41138' title='41138'>7. The Episode of the Barrel</span>
<p>
<span sid='41139' title='41139'>The police had brought a cab with them, and in this I escorted Miss Morstan back to her home. </span>
<span sid='41140' title='41140'>After the angelic fashion of women, she had borne trouble with a calm face as long as there was someone weaker than herself to support, and I had found her bright and placid by the side of the frightened housekeeper. </span>
<span sid='41141' title='41141'>In the cab, however, she first turned faint, and then burst into a passion of weeping - so sorely had she been tried by the adventures of the night. </span>
<span sid='41142' title='41142'>She has told me since that she thought me cold and distant upon that journey. </span>
<span sid='41143' title='41143'>She little guessed the struggle within my breast, or the effort of self-restraint which held me back. </span>
<span sid='41144' title='41144'>My sympathies and my love went out to her, even as my hand had in the garden. </span>
<span sid='41145' title='41145'>I felt that years of the conventionalities of life could not teach me to know her sweet, brave nature as had this one day of strange experiences. </span>
<span sid='41146' title='41146'>Yet there were two thoughts which sealed the words of affection upon my lips. </span>
<span sid='41147' title='41147'>She was weak and helpless, shaken in mind and nerve. </span>
<span sid='41148' title='41148'>It was to take her at a disadvantage to obtrude love upon her at such a time. </span>
<span sid='41149' title='41149'>Worse still, she was rich. </span>
<span sid='41150' title='41150'>If Holmes's researches were successful, she would be an heiress. </span>
<span sid='41151' title='41151'>Was it fair, was it honourable, that a half-pay surgeon should take such advantage of an intimacy which chance had brought about? </span>
<span sid='41152' title='41152'>Might she not look upon me as a mere vulgar fortune-seeker? </span>
<span sid='41153' title='41153'>I could not bear to risk that such a thought should cross her mind. </span>
<span sid='41154' title='41154'>This <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Agra&t=h'>Agra</a> treasure intervened like an impassable barrier between us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41155' title='41155'>It was nearly two o'clock when we reached Mrs. Cecil Forrester's. </span>
<span sid='41156' title='41156'>The servants had retired hours ago, but Mrs. Forrester had been so interested by the strange message which Miss Morstan had received that she had sat up in the hope of her return. </span>
<span sid='41157' title='41157'>She opened the door herself, a middle-aged, graceful woman, and it gave me joy to see how tenderly her arm stole round the other's waist, and how motherly was the voice in which she greeted her. </span>
<span sid='41158' title='41158'>She was clearly no mere paid dependent, but an honoured friend. </span>
<span sid='41159' title='41159'>I was introduced, and Mrs. Forrester earnestly begged me to step in and to tell her our adventures. </span>
<span sid='41160' title='41160'>I explained, however, the importance of my errand, and promised faithfully to call and report any progress which we might make with the case. </span>
<span sid='41161' title='41161'>As we drove away I stole a glance back, and I still seem to see that little group on the step - the two graceful, clinging figures, the half-opened door, the hall-light shining through stained glass, the barometer, and the bright stair-rods. </span>
<span sid='41162' title='41162'>It was soothing to catch even that passing glimpse of a tranquil English home in the midst of the wild, dark business which had absorbed us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41163' title='41163'>And the more I thought of what had happened, the wilder and darker it grew. </span>
<span sid='41164' title='41164'>I reviewed the whole extraordinary sequence of events as I rattled on through the silent, gas-lit streets. </span>
<span sid='41165' title='41165'>There was the original problem: that, at least, was pretty clear now. </span>
<span sid='41166' title='41166'>The death of Captain Morstan, the sending of the pearls, the advertisement, the letter - we had had light upon all those events. </span>
<span sid='41167' title='41167'>They had only led us, however, to a deeper and far more tragic mystery. </span>
<span sid='41168' title='41168'>The Indian treasure, the curious plan found among Morstan's baggage, the strange scene at Major Sholto's death, the rediscovery of the treasure immediately followed by the murder of the discoverer, the very singular accompaniments to the crime, the footsteps, the remarkable weapons, the words upon the card, corresponding with those upon Captain Morstan's chart - here was, indeed, a labyrinth in which a man less singularly endowed than my fellow-lodger might well despair of ever finding the clue.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41169' title='41169'>Pinchin Lane was a row of shabby, two-storied brick houses in the lower quarter of Lambeth. </span>
<span sid='41170' title='41170'>I had to knock for some time at No. 3 before I could make any impression. </span>
<span sid='41171' title='41171'>At last, however, there was the glint of a candle behind the blind, and a face looked out at the upper window.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41172' title='41172'>'Go on, you drunken vagabond,' said the face. </span>
<span sid='41173' title='41173'>'If you kick up any more row, I'll open the kennels and let out forty-three dogs upon you.' </span>
<span sid='41174' title='41174'>'If you'll let one out, it's just what I have come for,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41175' title='41175'>'Go on!' yelled the voice. </span>
<span sid='41176' title='41176'>'So help me gracious, I have a wiper in this bag, an' I'll drop it on your 'ead if you don't hook it!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41177' title='41177'>'But I want a dog,' I cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41178' title='41178'>'I won't be argued with!' shouted Mr. Sherman.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41179' title='41179'>'Now, stand clear; for when I say "Three," down goes the wiper.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41180' title='41180'>'Mr. Sherlock Holmes-' I began; but the words had a most magical effect, for the window instantly slammed down, and within a minute the door was unbarred and open. </span>
<span sid='41181' title='41181'>Mr. Sherman was a lanky, lean old man, with stooping shoulders, a stringy neck, and blue-tinted glasses.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41182' title='41182'>'A friend of Mr. Sherlock is always welcome,' said he. </span>
<span sid='41183' title='41183'>'Step in, sir. </span>
<span sid='41184' title='41184'>Keep clear of the badger, for he bites. </span>
<span sid='41185' title='41185'>Ah, naughty, naughty! would you take a nip at the gentleman?' </span>
<span sid='41186' title='41186'>This to a stoat, which thrust its wicked head and red eyes between the bars of its cage. </span>
<span sid='41187' title='41187'>'Don't mind that, sir; it's only a slow-worm. </span>
<span sid='41188' title='41188'>It hain't got no fangs, so I gives it the run o' the room, for it keeps the beetles down. </span>
<span sid='41189' title='41189'>You must not mind my bein' just a little short wi' you at first, for I'm guyed at by the children, and there's many a one just comes down this lane to knock me up. </span>
<span sid='41190' title='41190'>What was it that Mr. Sherlock Holmes wanted, sir?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41191' title='41191'>'He wanted a dog of yours.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41192' title='41192'>'Ah! that would be Toby.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41193' title='41193'>'Yes, "Toby" was the name.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41194' title='41194'>'Toby lives at No. 7 on the left here.' </span>
<span sid='41195' title='41195'>He moved slowly forward with his candle among the queer animal family which he had gathered round him. </span>
<span sid='41196' title='41196'>In the uncertain, shadowy light I could see dimly that there were glancing, glimmering eyes peeping down at us from every cranny and corner. </span>
<span sid='41197' title='41197'>Even the rafters above our heads were lined by solemn fowls, who lazily shifted their weight from one leg to the other as our voices disturbed their slumbers.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41198' title='41198'>Toby proved to be an ugly, long-haired, lop-eared creature, half spaniel and half lurcher, brown and white in colour, with a very clumsy, waddling gait. </span>
<span sid='41199' title='41199'>It accepted, after some hesitation, a lump of sugar which the old naturalist handed to me, and, having thus sealed an alliance, it followed me to the cab, and made no difficulties about accompanying me. </span>
<span sid='41200' title='41200'>It had just struck three on the Palace clock when I found myself back once more at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pondicherry&t=h'>Pondicherry</a> Lodge. </span>
<span sid='41201' title='41201'>The ex-prizefighter McMurdo had, I found, been arrested as an accessory, and both he and Mr. Sholto had been marched off to the station. </span>
<span sid='41202' title='41202'>Two constables guarded the narrow gate, but they allowed me to pass with the dog on my mentioning the detective's name.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41203' title='41203'>Holmes was standing on the doorstep, with his hands in his pockets, smoking his pipe.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41204' title='41204'>'Ah, you have him there!' said he. </span>
<span sid='41205' title='41205'>'Good dog, then! </span>
<span sid='41206' title='41206'>Athelney Jones has gone. </span>
<span sid='41207' title='41207'>We have had an immense display of energy since you left. </span>
<span sid='41208' title='41208'>He has arrested not only friend Thaddeus, but the gatekeeper, the housekeeper, and the Indian servant. </span>
<span sid='41209' title='41209'>We have the place to ourselves, but for a sergeant upstairs. </span>
<span sid='41210' title='41210'>Leave the dog here and come up.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41211' title='41211'>We tied Toby to the hall table, and reascended the stairs. </span>
<span sid='41212' title='41212'>The room was as we had left it, save that a sheet had been draped over the central figure. </span>
<span sid='41213' title='41213'>A weary-looking police-sergeant reclined in the corner.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41214' title='41214'>'Lend me your bull's-eye, sergeant,' said my companion. </span>
<span sid='41215' title='41215'>'Now tie this bit of card round my neck, so as to hang it in front of me. </span>
<span sid='41216' title='41216'>Thank you. </span>
<span sid='41217' title='41217'>Now I must kick off my boots and stockings. </span>
<span sid='41218' title='41218'>Just you carry them down with you, Watson. </span>
<span sid='41219' title='41219'>I am going to do a little climbing. </span>
<span sid='41220' title='41220'>And dip my handkerchief into the creosote. </span>
<span sid='41221' title='41221'>That will do. </span>
<span sid='41222' title='41222'>Now come up into the garret with me for a moment.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41223' title='41223'>We clambered up through the hole. </span>
<span sid='41224' title='41224'>Holmes turned his light once more upon the footsteps in the dust.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41225' title='41225'>'I wish you particularly to notice these footmarks,' he said. </span>
<span sid='41226' title='41226'>'Do you observe anything noteworthy about them?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41227' title='41227'>'They belong,' I said, 'to a child or a small woman.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41228' title='41228'>'Apart from their size, though. </span>
<span sid='41229' title='41229'>Is there nothing else?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41230' title='41230'>'They appear to be much as other footmarks.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41231' title='41231'>'Not at all. </span>
<span sid='41232' title='41232'>Look here! </span>
<span sid='41233' title='41233'>This is the print of a right foot in the dust. </span>
<span sid='41234' title='41234'>Now I make one with my naked foot beside it. </span>
<span sid='41235' title='41235'>What is the chief difference?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41236' title='41236'>'Your toes are all cramped together. </span>
<span sid='41237' title='41237'>The other print has each toe distinctly divided.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41238' title='41238'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='41239' title='41239'>That is the point. </span>
<span sid='41240' title='41240'>Bear that in mind. </span>
<span sid='41241' title='41241'>Now, would you kindly step over to that flap-window and smell the edge of the wood-work? </span>
<span sid='41242' title='41242'>I shall stay over here, as I have this handkerchief in my hand.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41243' title='41243'>I did as he directed, and was instantly conscious of a strong tarry smell.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41244' title='41244'>'That is where he put his foot in getting out. </span>
<span sid='41245' title='41245'>If you can trace him, I should think that Toby will have no difficulty. </span>
<span sid='41246' title='41246'>Now run downstairs, loose the dog, and look out for Blondin.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41247' title='41247'>By the time that I got out into the grounds Sherlock Holmes was on the roof, and I could see him like an enormous glow-worm crawling very slowly along the ridge. </span>
<span sid='41248' title='41248'>I lost sight of him behind a stack of chimneys, but he presently reappeared, and then vanished once more upon the opposite side. </span>
<span sid='41249' title='41249'>When I made my way round there I found him seated at one of the corner eaves.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41250' title='41250'>'That you, Watson?' he cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41251' title='41251'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41252' title='41252'>'This is the place. </span>
<span sid='41253' title='41253'>What is that black thing down there?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41254' title='41254'>'A water-barrel.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41255' title='41255'>'Top on it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41256' title='41256'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41257' title='41257'>'No sign of a ladder?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41258' title='41258'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41259' title='41259'>'Confound the fellow! </span>
<span sid='41260' title='41260'>It's a most breakneck place. </span>
<span sid='41261' title='41261'>I ought to be able to come down where he could climb up. </span>
<span sid='41262' title='41262'>The water-pipe feels pretty firm. </span>
<span sid='41263' title='41263'>Here goes, anyhow.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41264' title='41264'>There was a scuffling of feet, and the lantern began to come steadily down the side of the wall. </span>
<span sid='41265' title='41265'>Then with a light spring he came on to the barrel, and from there to the earth.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41266' title='41266'>'It was easy to follow him,' he said, drawing on his stockings and boots. </span>
<span sid='41267' title='41267'>'Tiles were loosened the whole way along, and in his hurry he had dropped this. </span>
<span sid='41268' title='41268'>It confirms my diagnosis, as you doctors express it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41269' title='41269'>The object which he held up to me was a small pocket or pouch woven out of coloured grasses, and with a few tawdry beads strung round it. </span>
<span sid='41270' title='41270'>In shape and size it was not unlike a cigarette-case. </span>
<span sid='41271' title='41271'>Inside were half-a-dozen spines of dark wood, sharp at one end and rounded at the other, like that which had struck Bartholomew Sholto.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41272' title='41272'>'They are hellish things,' said he. </span>
<span sid='41273' title='41273'>'Look out that you don't prick yourself. </span>
<span sid='41274' title='41274'>I'm delighted to have them, for the chances are that they are all he has. </span>
<span sid='41275' title='41275'>There is the less fear of you or me finding one in our skin before long. </span>
<span sid='41276' title='41276'>I would sooner face a Martini bullet myself. </span>
<span sid='41277' title='41277'>Are you game for a six-mile trudge, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41278' title='41278'>'Certainly,' I answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41279' title='41279'>'Your leg will stand it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41280' title='41280'>'Oh, yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41281' title='41281'>'Here you are, doggy! </span>
<span sid='41282' title='41282'>Good old Toby! </span>
<span sid='41283' title='41283'>Smell it, Toby, smell it!' </span>
<span sid='41284' title='41284'>He pushed the creosote handkerchief under the dog's nose, while the creature stood with its fluffy legs separated, and with a most comical cock to its head, like a connoisseur sniffing the bouquet of a famous vintage. </span>
<span sid='41285' title='41285'>Holmes then threw the handkerchief to a distance, fastened a stout cord to the mongrel's collar, and led him to the foot of the water-barrel. </span>
<span sid='41286' title='41286'>The creature instantly broke into a succession of high, tremulous yelps, and, with his nose on the ground, and his tail in the air, pattered off upon the trail at a pace which strained his leash and kept us at the top of our speed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41287' title='41287'>The east had been gradually whitening, and we could now see some distance in the cold, grey light. </span>
<span sid='41288' title='41288'>The square, massive house, with its black, empty windows and high, bare walls, towered up, sad and forlorn, behind us. </span>
<span sid='41289' title='41289'>Our course led right across the grounds, in and out among the trenches and pits with which they were scarred and intersected. </span>
<span sid='41290' title='41290'>The whole place, with its scattered dirt-heaps and ill-grown shrubs, had a blighted, ill-omened look which harmonized with the black tragedy which hung over it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41291' title='41291'>On reaching the boundary wall Toby ran along, whining eagerly, underneath its shadow, and stopped finally in a corner screened by a young beech. </span>
<span sid='41292' title='41292'>Where the two walls joined, several bricks had been loosened, and the crevices left were worn down and rounded upon the lower side, as though they had frequently been used as a ladder. </span>
<span sid='41293' title='41293'>Holmes clambered up, and, taking the dog from me, he dropped it over upon the other side.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41294' title='41294'>'There's the print of wooden-leg's hand,' he remarked, as I mounted up beside him. </span>
<span sid='41295' title='41295'>'You see the slight smudge of blood upon the white plaster. </span>
<span sid='41296' title='41296'>What a lucky thing it is that we have had no very heavy rain since yesterday! </span>
<span sid='41297' title='41297'>The scent will lie upon the road in spite of their eight-and-twenty hours' start.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41298' title='41298'>I confess that I had my doubts myself when I reflected upon the great traffic which had passed along the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> road in the interval. </span>
<span sid='41299' title='41299'>My fears were soon appeased, however. </span>
<span sid='41300' title='41300'>Toby never hesitated or swerved, but waddled on in his peculiar rolling fashion. </span>
<span sid='41301' title='41301'>Clearly, the pungent smell of the creosote rose high above all other contending scents.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41302' title='41302'>'Do not imagine,' said Holmes, 'that I depend for my success in this case upon the mere chance of one of these fellows having put his foot in the chemical. </span>
<span sid='41303' title='41303'>I have knowledge now which would enable me to trace them in many different ways. </span>
<span sid='41304' title='41304'>This, however, is the readiest, and, since fortune has put it into our hands, I should be culpable if I neglected it. </span>
<span sid='41305' title='41305'>It has, however, prevented the case from becoming the pretty little intellectual problem which it at one time promised to be. </span>
<span sid='41306' title='41306'>There might have been some credit to be gained out of it, but for this too palpable clue.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41307' title='41307'>'There is credit, and to spare,' said I. </span>
<span sid='41308' title='41308'>'I assure you, Holmes, that I marvel at the means by which you obtain your results in this case, even more than I did in the Jefferson Hope murder. </span>
<span sid='41309' title='41309'>The thing seems to me to be deeper and more inexplicable. </span>
<span sid='41310' title='41310'>How, for example, could you describe with such confidence the wooden-legged man?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41311' title='41311'>'Pshaw, my dear boy! it was simplicity itself. </span>
<span sid='41312' title='41312'>I don't wish to be theatrical. </span>
<span sid='41313' title='41313'>It is all patent and aboveboard. </span>
<span sid='41314' title='41314'>Two officers who are in command of a convict guard learn an important secret as to buried treasure. </span>
<span sid='41315' title='41315'>A map is drawn for them by an Englishman named Jonathan Small. </span>
<span sid='41316' title='41316'>You remember that we saw the name upon the chart in Captain Morstan's possession. </span>
<span sid='41317' title='41317'>He had signed it in behalf of himself and his associates  - the sign of the four, as he somewhat dramatically called it. </span>
<span sid='41318' title='41318'>Aided by this chart, the officers - or one of them - gets the treasure and brings it to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, leaving, we will suppose, some condition under which he received it unfulfilled. </span>
<span sid='41319' title='41319'>Now, then, why did not Jonathan Small get the treasure himself? </span>
<span sid='41320' title='41320'>The answer is obvious. </span>
<span sid='41321' title='41321'>The chart is dated at a time when Morstan was brought into close association with convicts. </span>
<span sid='41322' title='41322'>Jonathan Small did not get the treasure because he and his associates were themselves convicts and could not get away.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41323' title='41323'>'But this is mere speculation,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41324' title='41324'>'It is more than that. </span>
<span sid='41325' title='41325'>It is the only hypothesis which covers the facts. </span>
<span sid='41326' title='41326'>Let us see how it fits in with the sequel. </span>
<span sid='41327' title='41327'>Major Sholto remains at peace for some years, happy in the possession of his treasure. </span>
<span sid='41328' title='41328'>Then he receives a letter from India which gives him a great fright. </span>
<span sid='41329' title='41329'>What was that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41330' title='41330'>'A letter to say that the men whom he had wronged had been set free.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41331' title='41331'>'Or had escaped. </span>
<span sid='41332' title='41332'>That is much more likely, for he would have known what their term of imprisonment was. </span>
<span sid='41333' title='41333'>It would not have been a surprise to him. </span>
<span sid='41334' title='41334'>What does he do then? </span>
<span sid='41335' title='41335'>He guards himself against a wooden-legged man - a white man, mark you, for he mistakes a white tradesman for him, and actually fires a pistol at him. </span>
<span sid='41336' title='41336'>Now, only one white man's name is on the chart. </span>
<span sid='41337' title='41337'>The others are Hindus or Mohammedans. </span>
<span sid='41338' title='41338'>There is no other white man. </span>
<span sid='41339' title='41339'>Therefore, we may say with confidence that the wooden-legged man is identical with Jonathan Small. </span>
<span sid='41340' title='41340'>Does the reasoning strike you as being faulty?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41341' title='41341'>'No: it is clear and concise.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41342' title='41342'>'Well, now, let us put ourselves in the place of Jonathan Small. </span>
<span sid='41343' title='41343'>Let us look at it from his point of view. </span>
<span sid='41344' title='41344'>He comes to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> with the double idea of regaining what he would consider to be his rights, and of having his revenge upon the man who had wronged him. </span>
<span sid='41345' title='41345'>He found out where Sholto lived, and very possibly he established communications with someone inside the house. </span>
<span sid='41346' title='41346'>There is this butler, Lal Rao, whom we have not seen. </span>
<span sid='41347' title='41347'>Mrs. Bernstone gives him far from a good character. </span>
<span sid='41348' title='41348'>Small could not find out, however, where the treasure was hid, for no one ever knew, save the major and one faithful servant who had died. </span>
<span sid='41349' title='41349'>Suddenly, Small learns that the major is on his death-bed. </span>
<span sid='41350' title='41350'>In a frenzy lest the secret of the treasure die with him, he runs the gauntlet of the guards, makes his way to the dying man's window, and is only deterred from entering by the presence of his two sons. </span>
<span sid='41351' title='41351'>Mad with hate, however, against the dead man, he enters the room that night, searches his private papers in the hope of discovering some memorandum relating to the treasure, and finally leaves a memento of his visit in the short inscription upon the card. </span>
<span sid='41352' title='41352'>He had doubtless planned beforehand that, should he slay the major, he would leave some such record upon the body as a sign that it was not a common murder, but, from the point of view of the four associates, something in the nature of an act of justice. </span>
<span sid='41353' title='41353'>Whimsical and bizarre conceits of this kind are common enough in the annals of crime, and usually afford valuable indications as to the criminal. </span>
<span sid='41354' title='41354'>Do you follow all this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41355' title='41355'>'Very dearly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41356' title='41356'>'Now, what could Jonathan Small do? </span>
<span sid='41357' title='41357'>He could only continue to keep a secret watch upon the efforts made to find the treasure. </span>
<span sid='41358' title='41358'>Possibly he leaves <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> and only comes back at intervals. </span>
<span sid='41359' title='41359'>Then comes the discovery of the garret, and he is instantly informed of it. </span>
<span sid='41360' title='41360'>We again trace the presence of some confederate in the household. </span>
<span sid='41361' title='41361'>Jonathan, with his wooden leg, is utterly unable to reach the lofty room of Bartholomew Sholto. </span>
<span sid='41362' title='41362'>He takes with him, however, a rather curious associate, who gets over this difficulty, but dips his naked foot into creosote, whence come Toby, and a six-mile limp for a half-pay officer with a damaged tendo Achillis.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41363' title='41363'>'But it was the associate, and not Jonathan, who committed the crime.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41364' title='41364'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='41365' title='41365'>And rather to Jonathan's disgust, to judge by the way he stamped about when he got into the room. </span>
<span sid='41366' title='41366'>He bore no grudge against Bartholomew Sholto, and would have preferred if he could have been simply bound and gagged. </span>
<span sid='41367' title='41367'>He did not wish to put his head in a halter. </span>
<span sid='41368' title='41368'>There was no help for it, however: the savage instincts of his companion had broken out, and the poison had done its work: so Jonathan Small left his record, lowered the treasure-box to the ground, and followed it himself. </span>
<span sid='41369' title='41369'>That was the train of events as far as I can decipher them. </span>
<span sid='41370' title='41370'>Of course, as to his personal appearance he must be middle-aged, and must be sunburned after serving his time in such an oven as the Andamans. </span>
<span sid='41371' title='41371'>His height is readily calculated from the length of his stride, and we know that he was bearded. </span>
<span sid='41372' title='41372'>His hairiness was the one point which impressed itself upon Thaddeus Sholto when he saw him at the window. </span>
<span sid='41373' title='41373'>I don't know that there is anything else.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41374' title='41374'>'The associate?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41375' title='41375'>'Ah, well, there is no great mystery in that. </span>
<span sid='41376' title='41376'>But you will know all about it soon enough. </span>
<span sid='41377' title='41377'>How sweet the morning air is! </span>
<span sid='41378' title='41378'>See how that one little cloud floats like a pink feather from some gigantic flamingo. </span>
<span sid='41379' title='41379'>Now the red rim of the sun pushes itself over the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> cloud-bank. </span>
<span sid='41380' title='41380'>It shines on a good many folk, but on none, I dare bet, who are on a stranger errand than you and I. </span>
<span sid='41381' title='41381'>How small we feel, with our petty ambitions and strivings in the presence of the great elemental forces of Nature! </span>
<span sid='41382' title='41382'>Are you well up in your Jean Paul?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41383' title='41383'>'Fairly so. </span>
<span sid='41384' title='41384'>I worked back to him through Carlyle.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41385' title='41385'>'That was like following the brook to the parent lake. </span>
<span sid='41386' title='41386'>He makes one curious but profound remark. </span>
<span sid='41387' title='41387'>It is that the chief proof of man's real greatness lies in his perception of his own smallness. </span>
<span sid='41388' title='41388'>It argues, you see, a power of comparison and of appreciation which is in itself a proof of nobility. </span>
<span sid='41389' title='41389'>There is much food for thought in Richter. </span>
<span sid='41390' title='41390'>You have not a pistol, have you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41391' title='41391'>'I have my stick.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41392' title='41392'>'It is just possible that we may need something of the sort if we get to their lair Jonathan I shall leave to you, but if the other turns nasty I shall shoot him dead.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41393' title='41393'>He took out his revolver as he spoke, and, having loaded two of the chambers, he put it back into the right-hand pocket of his jacket.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41394' title='41394'>We had during this time been following the guidance of Toby down the half-rural villa-lined roads which lead to the Metropolis. </span>
<span sid='41395' title='41395'>Now, however, we were beginning to come among continuous streets, where labourers and dockmen were already astir, and slatternly women were taking down shutters and brushing door-steps. </span>
<span sid='41396' title='41396'>At the square-topped corner public-houses business was just beginning, and rough-looking men were emerging, rubbing their sleeves across their beards after their morning wet. </span>
<span sid='41397' title='41397'>Strange dogs sauntered up and stared wonderingly at us as we passed, but our inimitable Toby looked neither to the right nor to the left, but trotted onwards with his nose to the ground and an occasional eager whine which spoke of a hot scent.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41398' title='41398'>We had traversed <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Streatham&t=h'>Streatham</a>, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a>, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Camberwell&t=h'>Camberwell</a>, and now found ourselves in Kennington Lane, having borne away through the side streets to the east of the Oval. </span>
<span sid='41399' title='41399'>The men whom we pursued seemed to have taken a curiously zig-zag road, with the idea probably of escaping observation. </span>
<span sid='41400' title='41400'>They had never kept to the main road if a parallel side-street would serve their turn. </span>
<span sid='41401' title='41401'>At the foot of Kennington Lane they had edged away to the left through <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bond Street&t=h'>Bond Street</a> and Miles Street. </span>
<span sid='41402' title='41402'>Where the latter street turns into Knight's Place, Toby ceased to advance, but began to run backwards and forwards with one ear cocked and the other drooping, the very picture of canine indecision. </span>
<span sid='41403' title='41403'>Then he waddled round in circles, looking up to us from time to time, as if to ask for sympathy in his embarrassment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41404' title='41404'>'What the deuce is the matter with the dog?' growled Holmes. </span>
<span sid='41405' title='41405'>'They surely would not take a cab, or go off in a balloon.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41406' title='41406'>'Perhaps they stood here for some time,' I suggested.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41407' title='41407'>'Ah! it's all right. </span>
<span sid='41408' title='41408'>He's off again,' said my companion, in a tone of relief.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41409' title='41409'>He was indeed off, for after sniffing round again he suddenly made up his mind, and darted away with an energy and determination such as he had not yet shown. </span>
<span sid='41410' title='41410'>The scent appeared to be much hotter than before, for he had not even to put his nose on the ground, but tugged at his leash and tried to break into a run. </span>
<span sid='41411' title='41411'>I could see by the gleam in Holmes's eyes that he thought we were nearing the end of our journey.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41412' title='41412'>Our course now ran down Nine Elms until we came to Broderick and Nelson's large timber-yard, just past the White Eagle tavern. </span>
<span sid='41413' title='41413'>Here the dog, frantic with excitement, turned down through the side gate into the enclosure, where the sawyers were already at work. </span>
<span sid='41414' title='41414'>On the dog raced through sawdust and shavings, down an alley, round a passage, between two woodpiles, and finally, with a triumphant yelp, sprang upon a large barrel which still stood upon the hand-trolley on which it had been brought. </span>
<span sid='41415' title='41415'>With lolling tongue and blinking eyes, Toby stood upon the cask, looking from one to the other of us for some sign of appreciation. </span>
<span sid='41416' title='41416'>The staves of the barrel and the wheels of the trolley were smeared with a dark liquid, and the whole air was heavy with the smell of creosote.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41417' title='41417'>Sherlock Holmes and I looked blankly at each other, and then burst simultaneously into an uncontrollable fit of laughter.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41418' title='41418'>8. The <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> Irregulars</span>
<p>
<span sid='41419' title='41419'>'What now?' I asked. </span>
<span sid='41420' title='41420'>'Toby has lost his character for infallibility.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41421' title='41421'>'He acted according to his lights,' said Holmes, lifting him down from the barrel and walking him out of the timber-yard. </span>
<span sid='41422' title='41422'>'If you consider how much creosote is carted about <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> in one day, it is no great wonder that our trail should have been crossed. </span>
<span sid='41423' title='41423'>It is much used now, especially for the seasoning of wood. </span>
<span sid='41424' title='41424'>Poor Toby is not to blame.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41425' title='41425'>'We must get on the main scent again, I suppose.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41426' title='41426'>'Yes. </span>
<span sid='41427' title='41427'>And, fortunately, we have no distance to go. </span>
<span sid='41428' title='41428'>Evidently what puzzled the dog at the corner of Knight's Place was that there were two different trails running in opposite directions. </span>
<span sid='41429' title='41429'>We took the wrong one. </span>
<span sid='41430' title='41430'>It only remains to follow the other.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41431' title='41431'>There was no difficulty about this. </span>
<span sid='41432' title='41432'>On leading Toby to the place where he had committed his fault, he cast about in a wide circle and finally dashed off in a fresh direction.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41433' title='41433'>'We must take care that he does not now bring us to the place where the creosote-barrel came from,' I observed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41434' title='41434'>'I had thought of that. </span>
<span sid='41435' title='41435'>But you notice that he keeps on the pavement, whereas the barrel passed down the roadway. </span>
<span sid='41436' title='41436'>No, we are on the true scent now.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41437' title='41437'>It tended down towards the river-side, running through Belmont Place and Prince's Street. </span>
<span sid='41438' title='41438'>At the end of Broad Street it ran right down to the water's edge, where there was a small wooden wharf. </span>
<span sid='41439' title='41439'>Toby led us to the very edge of this, and there stood whining, looking out on the dark current beyond.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41440' title='41440'>'We are out of luck,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='41441' title='41441'>'They have taken to a boat here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41442' title='41442'>Several small punts and skiffs were lying about in the water and on the edge of the wharf. </span>
<span sid='41443' title='41443'>We took Toby round to each in turn, but, though he sniffed earnestly, he made no sign.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41444' title='41444'>Close to the rude landing-stage was a small brick house, with a wooden placard slung out through the second window. </span>
<span sid='41445' title='41445'>' Mordecai Smith' was printed across it in large letters, and underneath, 'Boats to hire by the hour or day.' </span>
<span sid='41446' title='41446'>A second inscription above the door informed us that a steam launch was kept - a statement which was confirmed by a great pile of coke upon the jetty. </span>
<span sid='41447' title='41447'>Sherlock Holmes looked slowly round, and his face assumed an ominous expression.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41448' title='41448'>'This looks bad,' said he. </span>
<span sid='41449' title='41449'>'These fellows are sharper than I expected. </span>
<span sid='41450' title='41450'>They seem to have covered their tracks. </span>
<span sid='41451' title='41451'>There has, I fear, been preconcerted management here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41452' title='41452'>He was approaching the door of the house, when it opened, and a little curly-headed lad of six came running out, followed by a stoutish, red-faced woman with a large sponge in her hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41453' title='41453'>'You come back and be washed, Jack,' she shouted.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41454' title='41454'>'Come back, you young imp; for if your father comes home and finds you like that, he'll let us hear of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41455' title='41455'>'Dear little chap!' cried Holmes, strategically. </span>
<span sid='41456' title='41456'>'What a rosy-cheeked young rascal! </span>
<span sid='41457' title='41457'>Now, Jack, is there anything you would like?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41458' title='41458'>The youth pondered for a moment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41459' title='41459'>'I'd like a shillin',' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41460' title='41460'>'Nothing you would like better?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41461' title='41461'>'I'd like two shillin' better,' the prodigy answered, after some thought.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41462' title='41462'>'Here you are, then! </span>
<span sid='41463' title='41463'>Catch! </span>
<span sid='41464' title='41464'>- A fine child, Mrs. Smith!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41465' title='41465'>'Lor' bless you, sir, he is that, and forward. </span>
<span sid='41466' title='41466'>He gets a'most too much for me to manage, 'specially when my man is away days at a time.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41467' title='41467'>'Away, is he?' said Holmes, in a disappointed voice. </span>
<span sid='41468' title='41468'>'I am sorry for that, for I wanted to speak to Mr. Smith.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41469' title='41469'>'He's been away since yesterday mornin', sir, and, truth to tell, I am beginning to feel frightened about him. </span>
<span sid='41470' title='41470'>But if it was about a boat, sir, maybe I could serve as well.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41471' title='41471'>'I wanted to hire his steam launch.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41472' title='41472'>'Why, bless you, sir, it is in the steam launch that he has gone. </span>
<span sid='41473' title='41473'>That's what puzzles me; for I know there ain't more coals in her than would take her to about <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Woolwich&t=h'>Woolwich</a> and back. </span>
<span sid='41474' title='41474'>If he'd been away in the barge I'd ha' thought nothin'; for many a time a job has taken him as far as <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Gravesend&t=h'>Gravesend</a>, and then if there was much doin' there he might ha' stayed over. </span>
<span sid='41475' title='41475'>But what good is a steam launch without coals?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41476' title='41476'>'He might have bought some at a wharf down the river.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41477' title='41477'>'He might, sir, but it weren't his way. </span>
<span sid='41478' title='41478'>Many a time I've heard him call out at the prices they charge for a few odd bags. </span>
<span sid='41479' title='41479'>Besides, I don't like that wooden-legged man, wi' his ugly face and outlandish talk. </span>
<span sid='41480' title='41480'>What did he want always knockin' about here for?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41481' title='41481'>'A wooden-legged man?' said Holmes, with bland surprise.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41482' title='41482'>'Yes, sir, a brown, monkey-faced chap that's called more'n once for my old man. </span>
<span sid='41483' title='41483'>It was him that roused him up yesternight, and, what's more, my man knew he was comin', for he had steam up in the launch. </span>
<span sid='41484' title='41484'>I tell you straight, sir, I don't feel easy in my mind about it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41485' title='41485'>'But, my dear Mrs. Smith,' said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders, 'you are frightening yourself about nothing. </span>
<span sid='41486' title='41486'>How could you possibly tell that it was the wooden-legged man who came in the night? </span>
<span sid='41487' title='41487'>I don't quite understand how you can be so sure.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41488' title='41488'>'His voice, sir. </span>
<span sid='41489' title='41489'>I knew his voice, which is kind o' thick and foggy. </span>
<span sid='41490' title='41490'>He tapped at the winder - about three it would be. </span>
<span sid='41491' title='41491'>"Show a leg, matey," says he: </span>
<span sid='41492' title='41492'>"time to turn out guard." </span>
<span sid='41493' title='41493'>My old man woke up Jim - that's my eldest - and away they went, without so much as a word to me. </span>
<span sid='41494' title='41494'>I could hear the wooden leg clackin' on the stones.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41495' title='41495'>'And was this wooden-legged man alone?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41496' title='41496'>'Couldn't say, I am sure, sir. </span>
<span sid='41497' title='41497'>I didn't hear no one else.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41498' title='41498'>'I am sorry, Mrs. Smith, for I wanted a steam launch, and I have heard good reports of the - Let me see, what is her name?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41499' title='41499'>'The Aurora, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41500' title='41500'>'Ah! </span>
<span sid='41501' title='41501'>She's not that old green launch with a yellow line, very broad in the beam?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41502' title='41502'>'No, indeed. </span>
<span sid='41503' title='41503'>She's as trim a little thing as any on the river. </span>
<span sid='41504' title='41504'>She's been fresh painted, black with two red streaks.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41505' title='41505'>'Thanks. </span>
<span sid='41506' title='41506'>I hope that you will hear soon from Mr. Smith. </span>
<span sid='41507' title='41507'>I am going down the river, and if I should see anything of the Aurora I shall let him know that you are uneasy. </span>
<span sid='41508' title='41508'>A black funnel, you say?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41509' title='41509'>'No, sir. </span>
<span sid='41510' title='41510'>Black with a white band.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41511' title='41511'>'Ah, of course. </span>
<span sid='41512' title='41512'>It was the sides which were black. </span>
<span sid='41513' title='41513'>Good morning, Mrs. Smith. </span>
<span sid='41514' title='41514'>There is a boatman here with a wherry, Watson. </span>
<span sid='41515' title='41515'>We shall take it and cross the river.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41516' title='41516'>'The main thing with people of that sort,' said Holmes, as we sat in the sheets of the wherry, 'is never to let them think that their information can be of the slightest importance to you. </span>
<span sid='41517' title='41517'>If you do, they will instantly shut up like an oyster. </span>
<span sid='41518' title='41518'>If you listen to them under protest, as it were, you are very likely to get what you want.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41519' title='41519'>'Our course now seems pretty clear,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41520' title='41520'>'What would you do, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41521' title='41521'>'I would engage a launch and go down the river on the track of the Aurora.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41522' title='41522'>'My dear fellow, it would be a colossal task. </span>
<span sid='41523' title='41523'>She may have touched at any wharf on either side of the stream between here and <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Greenwich&t=h'>Greenwich</a>. </span>
<span sid='41524' title='41524'>Below the bridge there is a perfect labyrinth of landing-places for miles. </span>
<span sid='41525' title='41525'>It would take you days and days to exhaust them, if you set about it alone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41526' title='41526'>'Employ the police, then.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41527' title='41527'>'No. </span>
<span sid='41528' title='41528'>I shall probably call Athelney Jones in at the last moment. </span>
<span sid='41529' title='41529'>He is not a bad fellow, and I should not like to do anything which would injure him professionally. </span>
<span sid='41530' title='41530'>But I have a fancy for working it out myself, now that we have gone so far.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41531' title='41531'>'Could we advertise, then, asking for information from wharfingers?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41532' title='41532'>'Worse and worse! </span>
<span sid='41533' title='41533'>Our men would know that the chase was hot at their heels, and they would be off out of the country. </span>
<span sid='41534' title='41534'>As it is, they are likely enough to leave, but as long as they think they are perfectly safe they will be in no hurry. </span>
<span sid='41535' title='41535'>Jones's energy will be of use to us there, for his view of the case is sure to push itself into the daily Press, and the runaways will think that everyone is off on the wrong scent.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41536' title='41536'>'What are we to do, then?' I asked, as we landed near Millbank Penitentiary.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41537' title='41537'>'Take this hansom, drive home, have some breakfast, and get an hour's sleep. </span>
<span sid='41538' title='41538'>It is quite on the cards that we may be afoot to-night again. </span>
<span sid='41539' title='41539'>Stop at a telegraph office, cabby! </span>
<span sid='41540' title='41540'>We will keep Toby, for he may be of use to us yet.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41541' title='41541'>We pulled up at the Great Peter Street post-office, and Holmes dispatched his wire.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41542' title='41542'>'Whom do you think that is to?' he asked, as we resumed our journey.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41543' title='41543'>'I am sure I don't know.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41544' title='41544'>'You remember the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> division of the detective police force whom I employed in the Jefferson Hope case?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41545' title='41545'>'Well?' said I, laughing.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41546' title='41546'>'This is just the case where they might be invaluable. </span>
<span sid='41547' title='41547'>If they fail, I have other resources; but I shall try them first. </span>
<span sid='41548' title='41548'>That wire was to my dirty little lieutenant, Wiggins, and I expect that he and his gang will be with us before we have finished our breakfast.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41549' title='41549'>It was between eight and nine o'clock now, and I was conscious of a strong reaction after the successive excitements of the night. </span>
<span sid='41550' title='41550'>I was limp and weary, befogged in mind and fatigued in body. </span>
<span sid='41551' title='41551'>I had not the professional enthusiasm which carried my companion on, nor could I look at the matter as a mere abstract intellectual problem. </span>
<span sid='41552' title='41552'>As far as the death of Bartholomew Sholto went, I had heard little good of him, and could feel no intense antipathy to his murderers. </span>
<span sid='41553' title='41553'>The treasure, however, was a different matter. </span>
<span sid='41554' title='41554'>That, or part of it, belonged rightfully to Miss Morstan. </span>
<span sid='41555' title='41555'>While there was a chance of recovering it I was ready to devote my life to the one object. </span>
<span sid='41556' title='41556'>True, if I found it, it would probably put her for ever beyond my reach. </span>
<span sid='41557' title='41557'>Yet it would be a petty and selfish love which would be influenced by such a thought as that. </span>
<span sid='41558' title='41558'>If Holmes could work to find the criminals, I had a tenfold stronger reason to urge me on to find the treasure.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41559' title='41559'>A bath at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> and a complete change freshened me up wonderfully. </span>
<span sid='41560' title='41560'>When I came down to our room I found the breakfast laid and Holmes pouring out the coffee.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41561' title='41561'>'Here it is,' said he, laughing and pointing to an open newspaper. </span>
<span sid='41562' title='41562'>'The energetic Jones and the ubiquitous reporter have fixed it up between them. </span>
<span sid='41563' title='41563'>But you have had enough of the case. </span>
<span sid='41564' title='41564'>Better have your ham and eggs first.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41565' title='41565'>I took the paper from him and read the short notice, which was headed, 'Mysterious Business at Upper <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41566' title='41566'>'About twelve o'clock last night,' said the Standard, 'Mr. Bartholomew Sholto, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pondicherry&t=h'>Pondicherry</a> Lodge, Upper <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a>, was found dead in his room under circumstances which point to foul play. </span>
<span sid='41567' title='41567'>As far as we can learn, no actual traces of violence were found upon Mr. Sholto's person, but a valuable collection of Indian gems which the deceased gentleman had inherited from his father has been carried off. </span>
<span sid='41568' title='41568'>The discovery was first made by Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, who had called at the house with Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, brother of the deceased. </span>
<span sid='41569' title='41569'>By a singular piece of good fortune, Mr. Athelney Jones, the well-known member of the detective police force, happened to be at the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a> Police Station, and was on the ground within half an hour of the first alarm. </span>
<span sid='41570' title='41570'>His trained and experienced faculties were at once directed towards the detection of the criminals, with the gratifying result that the brother, Thaddeus Sholto, has already been arrested, together with the housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, an Indian butler named Lal Rao, and a porter, or gatekeeper, named McMurdo. </span>
<span sid='41571' title='41571'>It is quite certain that the thief or thieves were well acquainted with the house, for Mr. Jones's well-known technical knowledge and his powers of minute observation have enabled him to prove conclusively that the miscreants could not have entered by the door or by the window, but must have made their way across the roof of the building, and so through a trap-door into a room which communicated with that in which the body was found. </span>
<span sid='41572' title='41572'>This fact, which has been very clearly made out, proves conclusively that it was no mere haphazard burglary. </span>
<span sid='41573' title='41573'>The prompt and energetic action of the officers of the law shows the great advantage of the presence on such occasions of a single vigorous and masterful mind. </span>
<span sid='41574' title='41574'>We cannot but think that it supplies an argument to those who would wish to see our detectives more decentralized, and so brought into closer and more effective touch with the cases which it is their duty to investigate.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41575' title='41575'>'Isn't it gorgeous?' said Holmes, grinning over his coffee cup. </span>
<span sid='41576' title='41576'>'What do you think of it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41577' title='41577'>'I think that we have had a close shave ourselves of being arrested for the crime.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41578' title='41578'>'So do I. </span>
<span sid='41579' title='41579'>I wouldn't answer for our safety now, if he should happen to have another of his attacks of energy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41580' title='41580'>At this moment there was a loud ring at the bell, and I could hear Mrs. Hudson, our landlady, raising her voice in a wail of expostulation and dismay.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41581' title='41581'>'By heavens, Holmes,' said I, half rising, 'I believe that they are really after us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41582' title='41582'>'No, it's not quite so bad as that. </span>
<span sid='41583' title='41583'>It is the unofficial force - the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> irregulars.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41584' title='41584'>As he spoke, there came a swift pattering of naked feet upon the stairs, a clatter of high voices, and in rushed a dozen dirty and ragged little street Arabs. </span>
<span sid='41585' title='41585'>There was some show of discipline among them, despite their tumultuous entry, for they instantly drew up in line and stood facing us with expectant faces. </span>
<span sid='41586' title='41586'>One of their number, taller and older than the others, stood forward with an air of lounging superiority which was very funny in such a disreputable little scarecrow.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41587' title='41587'>'Got your message, sir,' said he, 'and brought 'em on sharp. </span>
<span sid='41588' title='41588'>Three bob and a tanner for tickets.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41589' title='41589'>'Here you are,' said Holmes, producing some silver. </span>
<span sid='41590' title='41590'>'In future they can report to you, Wiggins, and you to me. </span>
<span sid='41591' title='41591'>I cannot have the house invaded in this way. </span>
<span sid='41592' title='41592'>However, it is just as well that you should all hear the instructions. </span>
<span sid='41593' title='41593'>I want to find the whereabouts of a steam launch called the Aurora, owner Mordecai Smith, black with two red streaks, funnel black with a white band. </span>
<span sid='41594' title='41594'>She is down the river somewhere. </span>
<span sid='41595' title='41595'>I want one boy to be at Mordecai Smith's landing-stage opposite Millbank to say if the boat comes back. </span>
<span sid='41596' title='41596'>You must divide it out among yourselves, and do both banks thoroughly. </span>
<span sid='41597' title='41597'>Let me know the moment you have news. </span>
<span sid='41598' title='41598'>Is that all clear?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41599' title='41599'>'Yes, guv'nor,' said Wiggins.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41600' title='41600'>'The old scale of pay, and a guinea to the boy who finds the boat. </span>
<span sid='41601' title='41601'>Here's a day in advance. </span>
<span sid='41602' title='41602'>Now, off you go!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41603' title='41603'>He handed them a shilling each, and away they buzzed down the stairs, and I saw them a moment later streaming down the street.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41604' title='41604'>'If the launch is above water they will find her,' said Holmes, as he rose from the table and lit his pipe. </span>
<span sid='41605' title='41605'>'They can go everywhere, see everything, overhear everyone. </span>
<span sid='41606' title='41606'>I expect to hear before evening that they have spotted her. </span>
<span sid='41607' title='41607'>In the meanwhile, we can do nothing but await results. </span>
<span sid='41608' title='41608'>We cannot pick up the broken trail until we find either the Aurora or Mr. Mordecai Smith.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41609' title='41609'>'Toby could eat these scraps, I dare say. </span>
<span sid='41610' title='41610'>Are you going to bed, Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41611' title='41611'>'No; I am not tired. </span>
<span sid='41612' title='41612'>I have a curious constitution. </span>
<span sid='41613' title='41613'>I never remember feeling tired by work, though idleness exhausts me completely. </span>
<span sid='41614' title='41614'>I am going to smoke and to think over this queer business to which my fair client has introduced us. </span>
<span sid='41615' title='41615'>If ever man had an easy task, this of ours ought to be. </span>
<span sid='41616' title='41616'>Wooden-legged men are not so common, but the other man must, I should think, be absolutely unique.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41617' title='41617'>'That other man again!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41618' title='41618'>'I have no wish to make a mystery of him to you, anyway. </span>
<span sid='41619' title='41619'>But you must have formed your own opinion. </span>
<span sid='41620' title='41620'>Now, do consider the data. </span>
<span sid='41621' title='41621'>Diminutive footmarks, toes never fettered by boots, naked feet, stone-headed wooden mace, great agility, small poisoned darts. </span>
<span sid='41622' title='41622'>What do you make of all this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41623' title='41623'>'A savage!' I exclaimed. </span>
<span sid='41624' title='41624'>'Perhaps one of those Indians who were the associates of Jonathan Small.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41625' title='41625'>'Hardly that,' said he. </span>
<span sid='41626' title='41626'>'When first I saw signs of strange weapons, I was inclined to think so; but the remarkable character of the footmarks caused me to reconsider my views. </span>
<span sid='41627' title='41627'>Some of the inhabitants of the Indian Peninsula are small men, but none could have left such marks as that. </span>
<span sid='41628' title='41628'>The Hindu proper has long and thin feet. </span>
<span sid='41629' title='41629'>The sandal-wearing Mohammedan has the great toe well separated from the others, because the thong is commonly passed between. </span>
<span sid='41630' title='41630'>These little  darts, too, could only be shot in one way. </span>
<span sid='41631' title='41631'>They are from a blowpipe. </span>
<span sid='41632' title='41632'>Now, then, where are we to find our savage?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41633' title='41633'>'South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n,' I hazarded.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41634' title='41634'>He stretched his hand up, and took down a bulky volume from the shelf.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41635' title='41635'>'This is the first volume of a gazetteer which is now being published. </span>
<span sid='41636' title='41636'>It may be looked upon as the very latest authority. </span>
<span sid='41637' title='41637'>What have we here? </span>
<span sid='41638' title='41638'>"Andaman Islands, situated 340 miles to the north of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sumatra&t=h'>Sumatra</a>, in the Bay of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bengal&t=h'>Bengal</a>." </span>
<span sid='41639' title='41639'>Hum! hum! </span>
<span sid='41640' title='41640'>What's all this? </span>
<span sid='41641' title='41641'>Moist climate, coral reefs, sharks, Port Blair, convict barracks, Rutland Island, cottonwoods - Ah, here we are! </span>
<span sid='41642' title='41642'>"The aborigines of the Andaman Islands may perhaps claim the distinction of being the smallest race upon this earth, though some anthropologists prefer the Bushmen of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>, the Digger Indians of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>, and the Tierra del Fuegians. </span>
<span sid='41643' title='41643'>The average height is rather below four feet, although many full-grown adults may be found who are very much smaller than this. </span>
<span sid='41644' title='41644'>They are a fierce, morose, and intractable people, though capable of forming most devoted friendships when their confidence has once been gained." </span>
<span sid='41645' title='41645'>Mark that, Watson. </span>
<span sid='41646' title='41646'>Now, then, listen to this. </span>
<span sid='41647' title='41647'>"They are naturally hideous, having large, misshapen heads, small, fierce eyes, and distorted features. </span>
<span sid='41648' title='41648'>Their feet and hands, however, are remarkably small. </span>
<span sid='41649' title='41649'>So intractable and fierce are they, that all the efforts of the British officials have failed to win them over in any degree. </span>
<span sid='41650' title='41650'>They have always been a terror to shipwrecked crews, braining the survivors with their stone-headed clubs, or shooting them with their poisoned arrows. </span>
<span sid='41651' title='41651'>These massacres are invariably concluded by a cannibal feast." </span>
<span sid='41652' title='41652'>Nice, amiable people, Watson! </span>
<span sid='41653' title='41653'>If this fellow had been left to his own unaided devices, this affair might have taken an even more ghastly turn. </span>
<span sid='41654' title='41654'>I fancy that, even as it is, Jonathan Small would give a good deal not to have employed him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41655' title='41655'>'But how came he to have so singular a companion?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41656' title='41656'>'Ah, that is more than I can tell. </span>
<span sid='41657' title='41657'>Since, however, we had already determined that Small had come from the Andamans, it is not so very wonderful that this islander should be with him. </span>
<span sid='41658' title='41658'>No doubt we shall know all about it in time. </span>
<span sid='41659' title='41659'>Look here, Watson; you look regularly done. </span>
<span sid='41660' title='41660'>Lie down there on the sofa, and see if I can put you to sleep.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41661' title='41661'>He took up his violin from the corner, and as I stretched myself out he began to play some low, dreamy, melodious air - his own, no doubt, for he had a remarkable gift for improvization. </span>
<span sid='41662' title='41662'>I have a vague remembrance of his gaunt limbs, his earnest face, and the rise and fall of his bow. </span>
<span sid='41663' title='41663'>Then I seemed to be floated peacefully away upon a soft sea of sound, until I found myself in dreamland, with the sweet face of Mary Morstan looking down upon me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41664' title='41664'>9. A Break in the Chain</span>
<p>
<span sid='41665' title='41665'>It was late in the afternoon before I woke, strengthened and refreshed. </span>
<span sid='41666' title='41666'>Sherlock Holmes still sat exactly as I had left him, save that he had laid aside his violin and was deep in a book. </span>
<span sid='41667' title='41667'>He looked across at me as I stirred, and I noticed that his face was dark and troubled.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41668' title='41668'>'You have slept soundly,' he said. </span>
<span sid='41669' title='41669'>'I feared that our talk would wake you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41670' title='41670'>'I heard nothing,' I answered. </span>
<span sid='41671' title='41671'>'Have you had fresh news, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41672' title='41672'>'Unfortunately, no. </span>
<span sid='41673' title='41673'>I confess that I am surprised and disappointed. </span>
<span sid='41674' title='41674'>I expected something definite by this time. </span>
<span sid='41675' title='41675'>Wiggins has just been up to report. </span>
<span sid='41676' title='41676'>He says that no trace can be found of the launch. </span>
<span sid='41677' title='41677'>It is a provoking check, for every hour is of importance.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41678' title='41678'>'Can I do anything? </span>
<span sid='41679' title='41679'>I am perfectly fresh now, and quite ready for another night's outing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41680' title='41680'>'No; we can do nothing. </span>
<span sid='41681' title='41681'>We can only wait. </span>
<span sid='41682' title='41682'>If we go ourselves, the message might come in our absence, and delay be caused. </span>
<span sid='41683' title='41683'>You can do what you will, but I must remain on guard.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41684' title='41684'>'Then I shall run over to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Camberwell&t=h'>Camberwell</a> and call upon Mrs. Cecil Forrester. </span>
<span sid='41685' title='41685'>She asked me to, yesterday.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41686' title='41686'>'On Mrs. Cecil Forrester?' asked Holmes with the twinkle of a smile in his eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41687' title='41687'>'Well, of course, on Miss Morstan too. </span>
<span sid='41688' title='41688'>They were anxious to hear what happened.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41689' title='41689'>'I would not tell them too much,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='41690' title='41690'>'Women are never to be entirely trusted - not the best of them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41691' title='41691'>I did not pause to argue over this atrocious sentiment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41692' title='41692'>'I shall be back in an hour or two,' I remarked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41693' title='41693'>'All right! </span>
<span sid='41694' title='41694'>Good luck! </span>
<span sid='41695' title='41695'>But, I say, if you are crossing the water you may as well return Toby, for I don't think it is at all likely that we shall have any use for him now.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41696' title='41696'>I took our mongrel accordingly, and left him, together with a half-sovereign, at the old naturalist's in Pinchin Lane. </span>
<span sid='41697' title='41697'>At <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Camberwell&t=h'>Camberwell</a> I found Miss Morstan a little weary after her night's adventures, but very eager to hear the news. </span>
<span sid='41698' title='41698'>Mrs. Forrester, too, was full of curiosity. </span>
<span sid='41699' title='41699'>I told them all that we had done, suppressing, however, the more dreadful parts of the tragedy. </span>
<span sid='41700' title='41700'>Thus, although I spoke of Mr. Sholto's death, I said nothing of the exact manner and method of it. </span>
<span sid='41701' title='41701'>With all my omissions, however, there was enough to startle and amaze them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41702' title='41702'>'It is a romance!' cried Mrs. Forrester. </span>
<span sid='41703' title='41703'>'An injured lady, half a million in treasure, a black cannibal, and a wooden-legged ruffian. </span>
<span sid='41704' title='41704'>They take the place of the conventional dragon or wicked earl.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41705' title='41705'>'And two knight-errants to the rescue,' added Miss Morstan, with a bright glance at me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41706' title='41706'>'Why, Mary, your fortune depends upon the issue of this search. </span>
<span sid='41707' title='41707'>I don't think that you are nearly excited enough. </span>
<span sid='41708' title='41708'>Just imagine what it must be to be so rich, and to have the world at your feet!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41709' title='41709'>It sent a little thrill of joy to my heart to notice that she showed no sign of elation at the prospect. </span>
<span sid='41710' title='41710'>On the contrary, she gave a toss of her proud head, as though the matter were one in which she took small interest.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41711' title='41711'>'It is for Mr. Thaddeus Sholto that I am anxious,' she said. </span>
<span sid='41712' title='41712'>'Nothing else is of any consequence; but I think that he has behaved most kindly and honourably throughout. </span>
<span sid='41713' title='41713'>It is our duty to clear him of this dreadful and unfounded charge.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41714' title='41714'>It was evening before I left <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Camberwell&t=h'>Camberwell</a>, and quite dark by the time I reached home. </span>
<span sid='41715' title='41715'>My companion's book and pipe lay by his chair, but he had disappeared. </span>
<span sid='41716' title='41716'>I looked about in the hope of seeing a note, but there was none.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41717' title='41717'>'I suppose that Mr. Sherlock Holmes has gone out?' I said to Mrs. Hudson as she came up to lower the blinds.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41718' title='41718'>'No, sir. </span>
<span sid='41719' title='41719'>He has gone to his room, sir. </span>
<span sid='41720' title='41720'>Do you know, sir,' sinking her voice into an impressive whisper, 'I am afraid for his health?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41721' title='41721'>'Why so, Mrs. Hudson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41722' title='41722'>'Well, he's that strange, sir. </span>
<span sid='41723' title='41723'>After you was gone he walked and he walked, up and down, and up and down, until I was weary of the sound of his footstep. </span>
<span sid='41724' title='41724'>Then I heard him talking to himself and muttering, and every time the bell rang out he came on the stairhead, with "What is that, Mrs. Hudson?" </span>
<span sid='41725' title='41725'>And now he has slammed off to his room, but I can hear him walking away the same as ever. </span>
<span sid='41726' title='41726'>I hope he's not going to be ill, sir. </span>
<span sid='41727' title='41727'>I ventured to say something to him about cooling medicine, but he turned on me, sir, with such a look that I don't know however I got out of the room.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41728' title='41728'>'I don't think that you have any cause to be uneasy, Mrs. Hudson,' I answered. </span>
<span sid='41729' title='41729'>'I have seen him like this before. </span>
<span sid='41730' title='41730'>He has some small matter upon his mind which makes him restless.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41731' title='41731'>I tried to speak lightly to our worthy landlady, but I was myself somewhat uneasy when through the long night I still from time to time heard the dull sound of his tread, and knew how his keen spirit was chafing against this involuntary inaction.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41732' title='41732'>At breakfast-time he looked worn and haggard, with a little fleck of feverish colour upon either cheek.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41733' title='41733'>'You are knocking yourself up, old man,' I remarked. </span>
<span sid='41734' title='41734'>'I heard you marching about in the night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41735' title='41735'>'No, I could not sleep,' he answered. </span>
<span sid='41736' title='41736'>'This infernal problem is consuming me. </span>
<span sid='41737' title='41737'>It is too much to be baulked by so petty an obstacle, when all else had been overcome. </span>
<span sid='41738' title='41738'>I know the men, the launch, everything; and yet I can get no news. </span>
<span sid='41739' title='41739'>I have set other agencies at work, and used every means at my disposal. </span>
<span sid='41740' title='41740'>The whole river has been searched on either side, but there is no news, nor has Mrs. Smith heard of her husband. </span>
<span sid='41741' title='41741'>I shall come to the conclusion soon that they have scuttled the craft. </span>
<span sid='41742' title='41742'>But there are objections to that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41743' title='41743'>'Or that Mrs. Smith has put us on a wrong scent.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41744' title='41744'>'No, I think that may be dismissed. </span>
<span sid='41745' title='41745'>I had inquiries made, and there is a launch of that description.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41746' title='41746'>'Could it have gone up the river?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41747' title='41747'>'I have considered that possibility too, and there is a search-party who will work up as far as <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Richmond&t=h'>Richmond</a>. </span>
<span sid='41748' title='41748'>If no news comes to-day, I shall start off myself tomorrow, and go for the men rather than the boat. </span>
<span sid='41749' title='41749'>But surely, surely, we shall hear something.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41750' title='41750'>We did not, however. </span>
<span sid='41751' title='41751'>Not a word came to us either from Wiggins or from the other agencies. </span>
<span sid='41752' title='41752'>There were articles in most of the papers upon the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a> tragedy. </span>
<span sid='41753' title='41753'>They all appeared to be rather hostile to the unfortunate Thaddeus Sholto. </span>
<span sid='41754' title='41754'>No fresh details were to be found, however, in any of them, save that an inquest was to be held upon the following day. </span>
<span sid='41755' title='41755'>I walked over to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Camberwell&t=h'>Camberwell</a> in the evening to report our ill-success to the ladies, and on my return I found Holmes dejected and somewhat morose. </span>
<span sid='41756' title='41756'>He would hardly reply to my questions, and busied himself all the evening in an abstruse chemical analysis which involved much heating of retorts and distilling of vapours, ending at last in a smell which fairly drove me out of the apartment. </span>
<span sid='41757' title='41757'>Up to the small hours of the morning I could hear the clinking of his test-tubes, which told me that he was still engaged in his malodorous experiment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41758' title='41758'>In the early dawn I woke with a start, and was surprised to find him standing by my bedside, clad in a rude sailor dress with a pea-jacket, and a coarse red scarf round his neck.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41759' title='41759'>'I am off down the river, Watson,' said he. </span>
<span sid='41760' title='41760'>'I have been turning it over in my mind, and I can see only one way out of it. </span>
<span sid='41761' title='41761'>It is worth trying, at all events.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41762' title='41762'>'Surely I can come with you, then?' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41763' title='41763'>'No; you can be much more useful if you will remain here as my representative. </span>
<span sid='41764' title='41764'>I am loth to go, for it is quite on the cards that some message may come during the day, though Wiggins was despondent about it last night. </span>
<span sid='41765' title='41765'>I want you to open all notes and telegrams, and to act on your own judgment if any news should come. </span>
<span sid='41766' title='41766'>Can I rely upon you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41767' title='41767'>'Most certainly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41768' title='41768'>'I am afraid that you will not be able to wire to me, for I can hardly tell yet where I may find myself. </span>
<span sid='41769' title='41769'>If I am in luck, however, I may not be gone so very long. </span>
<span sid='41770' title='41770'>I shall have news of some sort or other before I get back.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41771' title='41771'>I had heard nothing of him by breakfast-time. </span>
<span sid='41772' title='41772'>On opening the Standard, however, I found that there was a fresh allusion to the business.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41773' title='41773'>'With reference to the Upper <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a> tragedy,' it remarked, 'we have reason to believe that the matter promises to be even more complex and mysterious than was originally supposed. </span>
<span sid='41774' title='41774'>Fresh evidence has shown that it is quite impossible that Mr. Thaddeus Sholto could have been in any way concerned in the matter. </span>
<span sid='41775' title='41775'>He and the housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, were both released yesterday evening. </span>
<span sid='41776' title='41776'>It is believed, however, that the police have a clue as to the real culprits, and that it is being prosecuted by Mr. Athelney Jones, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>, with all his well-known energy and sagacity. </span>
<span sid='41777' title='41777'>Further arrests may be expected at any moment.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41778' title='41778'>'That is satisfactory so far as it goes,' thought I. </span>
<span sid='41779' title='41779'>'Friend Sholto is safe, at any rate. </span>
<span sid='41780' title='41780'>I wonder what the fresh clue may be, though it seems to be a stereotyped form whenever the police have made a blunder.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41781' title='41781'>I tossed the paper down upon the table, but at that moment my eye caught an advertisement in the agony column. </span>
<span sid='41782' title='41782'>It ran in this way:</span>
<p>
<span sid='41783' title='41783'>'Lost. </span>
<span sid='41784' title='41784'>Whereas Mordecai Smith, boatman, and his son Jim, left Smith's Wharf at or about three o'clock last Tuesday morning in the steam launch Aurora, black with two red stripes, funnel black with a white band, the sum of five pounds will be paid to anyone who can give information to Mrs. Smith, at Smith's Wharf, or at 221b, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>, as to the whereabouts of the said Mordecai Smith and the launch Aurora.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41785' title='41785'>This was clearly Holmes's doing. </span>
<span sid='41786' title='41786'>The <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> address was enough to prove that. </span>
<span sid='41787' title='41787'>It struck me as rather ingenious, because it might be read by the fugitives without their seeing in it more than the natural anxiety of a wife for her missing husband.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41788' title='41788'>It was a long day. </span>
<span sid='41789' title='41789'>Every time that a knock came to the door, or a sharp step passed in the street, I imagined that it was either Holmes returning or an answer to his advertisement. </span>
<span sid='41790' title='41790'>I tried to read, but my thoughts would wander oft to our strange quest and to the ill-assorted and villainous pair whom we were pursuing. </span>
<span sid='41791' title='41791'>Could there be, I wondered, some radical flaw in my companion's reasoning? </span>
<span sid='41792' title='41792'>Might he not be suffering from some huge self-deception? </span>
<span sid='41793' title='41793'>Was it not possible that his nimble and speculative mind had built up this wild theory upon faulty premises? </span>
<span sid='41794' title='41794'>I had never known him to be wrong, and yet the keenest reasoner may occasionally be deceived. </span>
<span sid='41795' title='41795'>He was likely, I thought, to fall into error through the over-refinement of his logic - his preference for a subtle and bizarre explanation when a plainer and more commonplace one lay ready to his hand. </span>
<span sid='41796' title='41796'>Yet, on the other hand, I had myself seen the evidence, and I had heard the reasons for his deductions. </span>
<span sid='41797' title='41797'>When I looked back on the long chain of curious circumstances, many of them trivial in themselves, but all tending in the same direction, I could not disguise from myself that even if Holmes's explanation were incorrect the true theory must be equally outré and startling.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41798' title='41798'>At three o'clock in the afternoon there was a loud peal at the bell, an authoritative voice in the hall, and, to my surprise, no less a person than Mr. Athelney Jones was shown up to me. </span>
<span sid='41799' title='41799'>Very different was he, however, from the brusque and masterful professor of common-sense who had taken over the case so confidently at Upper <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a>. </span>
<span sid='41800' title='41800'>His expression was downcast, and his bearing meek and even apologetic.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41801' title='41801'>'Good-day, sir; good-day,' said he. </span>
<span sid='41802' title='41802'>'Mr. Sherlock Holmes is out, I understand?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41803' title='41803'>'Yes, and I cannot be sure when he will be back. </span>
<span sid='41804' title='41804'>But perhaps you would care to wait. </span>
<span sid='41805' title='41805'>Take that chair and try one of these cigars.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41806' title='41806'>'Thank you; I don't mind if I do,' said he, mopping his face with a red bandanna handkerchief.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41807' title='41807'>'And a whisky and soda?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41808' title='41808'>'Well, half a glass. </span>
<span sid='41809' title='41809'>It is very hot for the time of year; and I have had a good deal to worry and try me. </span>
<span sid='41810' title='41810'>You know my theory about this <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a> case?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41811' title='41811'>'I remember that you expressed one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41812' title='41812'>'Well, I have been obliged to reconsider it. </span>
<span sid='41813' title='41813'>I had my net drawn tightly round Mr. Sholto, sir, when pop he went through a hole in the middle of it. </span>
<span sid='41814' title='41814'>He was able to prove an alibi which could not be shaken. </span>
<span sid='41815' title='41815'>From the time that he left his brother's room he was never out of sight of someone or other. </span>
<span sid='41816' title='41816'>So it could not be he who climbed over roofs and through trap-doors. </span>
<span sid='41817' title='41817'>It's a very dark case, and my professional credit is at stake. </span>
<span sid='41818' title='41818'>I should be very glad of a little assistance.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41819' title='41819'>'We all need help sometimes,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41820' title='41820'>'Your friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes is a wonderful man, sir,' said he, in a husky and confidential voice. </span>
<span sid='41821' title='41821'>'He's a man who is not to be beat. </span>
<span sid='41822' title='41822'>I have known that young man go into a good many cases, but I never saw the case yet that he could not throw a light upon. </span>
<span sid='41823' title='41823'>He is irregular in his methods, and a little quick perhaps in jumping at theories; but, on the whole, I think he would have made a most promising officer and I don't care who knows it. </span>
<span sid='41824' title='41824'>I have had a wire from him this morning, by which I understand that he has got some clue to this Sholto business. </span>
<span sid='41825' title='41825'>Here is his message.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41826' title='41826'>He took the telegram out of his pocket, and handed it to me. </span>
<span sid='41827' title='41827'>It was dated from Poplar at twelve o'clock. </span>
<span sid='41828' title='41828'>'Go to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> at once,' it said. </span>
<span sid='41829' title='41829'>'If I have not returned, wait for me. </span>
<span sid='41830' title='41830'>I am close on the track of the Sholto gang. </span>
<span sid='41831' title='41831'>You can come with us to-night if you want to be in at the finish.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41832' title='41832'>'This sounds well. </span>
<span sid='41833' title='41833'>He has evidently picked up the scent again,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41834' title='41834'>'Ah, then he has been at fault too,' exclaimed Jones, with evident satisfaction. </span>
<span sid='41835' title='41835'>'Even the best of us are thrown off sometimes. </span>
<span sid='41836' title='41836'>Of course this may prove to be a false alarm; but it is my duty as an officer of the law to allow no chance to slip. </span>
<span sid='41837' title='41837'>But there is someone at the door. </span>
<span sid='41838' title='41838'>Perhaps this is he.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41839' title='41839'>A heavy step was heard ascending the stair, with a great wheezing and rattling as from a man who was sorely put to it for breath. </span>
<span sid='41840' title='41840'>Once or twice he stopped, as though the climb were too much for him, but at last he made his way to our door and entered. </span>
<span sid='41841' title='41841'>His appearance corresponded to the sounds which we had heard. </span>
<span sid='41842' title='41842'>He was an aged man, clad in seafaring garb, with an old pea-jacket buttoned up to his throat. </span>
<span sid='41843' title='41843'>His back was bowed, his knees were shaky, and his breathing was painfully asthmatic. </span>
<span sid='41844' title='41844'>As he leaned upon a thick oaken cudgel his shoulders heaved in the effort to draw the air into his lungs. </span>
<span sid='41845' title='41845'>He had a coloured scarf round his chin, and I could see little of his face save a pair of keen dark eyes, overhung by bushy white brows, and long grey side-whiskers. </span>
<span sid='41846' title='41846'>Altogether he gave me the impression of a respectable master mariner who had fallen into years and poverty.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41847' title='41847'>'What is it, my man?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41848' title='41848'>He looked about him in the slow methodical fashion of old age.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41849' title='41849'>'Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41850' title='41850'>'No; but I am acting for him. </span>
<span sid='41851' title='41851'>You can tell me any message you have for him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41852' title='41852'>'It was to him himself I was to tell it,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41853' title='41853'>'But I tell you I am acting for him. </span>
<span sid='41854' title='41854'>Was it about Mordecai Smith's boat?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41855' title='41855'>'Yes. </span>
<span sid='41856' title='41856'>I knows well where it is. </span>
<span sid='41857' title='41857'>An' I knows where the men he is after are. </span>
<span sid='41858' title='41858'>An' I knows where the treasure is. </span>
<span sid='41859' title='41859'>I knows all about it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41860' title='41860'>'Then tell me, and I shall let him know.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41861' title='41861'>'It was to him I was to tell it,' he repeated, with the petulant obstinacy of a very old man.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41862' title='41862'>'Well, you must wait for him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41863' title='41863'>'No, no; I ain't goin' to lose a whole day to please no one. </span>
<span sid='41864' title='41864'>If Mr. Holmes ain't here, then Mr. Holmes must find it all out for himself. </span>
<span sid='41865' title='41865'>I don't care about the look of either of you, and I won't tell a word.' </span>
<span sid='41866' title='41866'>He shuffled towards the door, but Athelney Jones got in front of him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41867' title='41867'>'Wait a bit, my friend,' said he. </span>
<span sid='41868' title='41868'>'You have important information, and you must not walk off. </span>
<span sid='41869' title='41869'>We shall keep you, whether you like or not, until our friend returns.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41870' title='41870'>The old man made a little run towards the door, but, as Athelney Jones put his broad back up against it, he recognized the uselessness of resistance.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41871' title='41871'>'Pretty sort o' treatment this!' he cried, stamping his stick. </span>
<span sid='41872' title='41872'>'I come here to see a gentleman, and you two, who I never saw in my life, seize me and treat me in this fashion!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41873' title='41873'>'You will be none the worse,' I said. </span>
<span sid='41874' title='41874'>'We shall recompense you for the loss of your time. </span>
<span sid='41875' title='41875'>Sit over here on the sofa, and you will not have long to wait.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41876' title='41876'>He came across sullenly enough, and seated himself with his face resting on his hands. </span>
<span sid='41877' title='41877'>Jones and I resumed our cigars and our talk. </span>
<span sid='41878' title='41878'>Suddenly, however, Holmes's voice broke in upon us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41879' title='41879'>'I think that you might offer me a cigar too,' he said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41880' title='41880'>We both started in our chairs. </span>
<span sid='41881' title='41881'>There was Holmes sitting close to us with an air of quiet amusement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41882' title='41882'>'Holmes!' I exclaimed. </span>
<span sid='41883' title='41883'>'You here! </span>
<span sid='41884' title='41884'>But where is the old man?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41885' title='41885'>'Here is the old man,' said he, holding out a heap of white hair. </span>
<span sid='41886' title='41886'>'Here he is - wig, whiskers, eyebrows, and all. </span>
<span sid='41887' title='41887'>I thought my disguise was pretty good, but I hardly expected that it would stand that test.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41888' title='41888'>'Ah, you rogue!' cried Jones, highly delighted. </span>
<span sid='41889' title='41889'>'You would have made an actor, and a rare one. </span>
<span sid='41890' title='41890'>You had the proper workhouse cough, and those weak legs of yours are worth ten pounds a week. </span>
<span sid='41891' title='41891'>I thought I knew the glint of your eye, though. </span>
<span sid='41892' title='41892'>You didn't get away from us so easily, you see.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41893' title='41893'>'I have been working in that get-up all day,' said he, lighting his cigar. </span>
<span sid='41894' title='41894'>'You see, a good many of the criminal classes begin to know me - especially since our friend here took to publishing some of my cases: so I can only go on the war-path under some simple disguise like this. </span>
<span sid='41895' title='41895'>You got my wire?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41896' title='41896'>'Yes; that was what brought me here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41897' title='41897'>'How has your case prospered?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41898' title='41898'>'It has all come to nothing. </span>
<span sid='41899' title='41899'>I have had to release two of my prisoners, and there is no evidence against the other two.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41900' title='41900'>'Never mind. </span>
<span sid='41901' title='41901'>We shall give you two others in the place of them. </span>
<span sid='41902' title='41902'>But you must put yourself under my orders. </span>
<span sid='41903' title='41903'>You are welcome to all the official credit, but you must act on the lines that I point out. </span>
<span sid='41904' title='41904'>Is that agreed?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41905' title='41905'>'Entirely, if you will help me to the men.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41906' title='41906'>'Well, then, in the first place I shall want a fast police-boat - a steam launch - to be at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the West&t=h'>the West</a>minster Stairs at seven o'clock.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41907' title='41907'>'That is easily managed. </span>
<span sid='41908' title='41908'>There is always one about there; but I can step across the road and telephone to make sure.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41909' title='41909'>'Then I shall want two stanch men, in case of resistance.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41910' title='41910'>'There will be two or three in the boat. </span>
<span sid='41911' title='41911'>What else?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41912' title='41912'>'When we secure the men we shall get the treasure. </span>
<span sid='41913' title='41913'>I think that it would be a pleasure to my friend here to take the box round to the young lady to whom half of it rightfully belongs. </span>
<span sid='41914' title='41914'>Let her be the first to open it. </span>
<span sid='41915' title='41915'>Eh, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41916' title='41916'>'It would be a great pleasure to me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41917' title='41917'>'Rather an irregular proceeding,' said Jones, shaking his head. </span>
<span sid='41918' title='41918'>'However, the whole thing is irregular, and I suppose we must wink at it. </span>
<span sid='41919' title='41919'>The treasure must afterwards be handed over to the authorities until after the official investigation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41920' title='41920'>'Certainly. </span>
<span sid='41921' title='41921'>That is easily managed. </span>
<span sid='41922' title='41922'>One other point. </span>
<span sid='41923' title='41923'>I should much like to have a few details about this matter from the lips of Jonathan Small himself. </span>
<span sid='41924' title='41924'>You know I like to work the details of my cases out. </span>
<span sid='41925' title='41925'>There is no objection to my having an unofficial interview with him, either here in my rooms or elsewhere, as long as he is efficiently guarded?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41926' title='41926'>'Well, you are master of the situation. </span>
<span sid='41927' title='41927'>I have had no proof yet of the existence of this Jonathan Small. </span>
<span sid='41928' title='41928'>However, if you can catch him, I don't see how I can refuse you an interview with him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41929' title='41929'>'That is understood, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41930' title='41930'>'Perfectly. </span>
<span sid='41931' title='41931'>Is there anything else?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41932' title='41932'>'Only that I insist upon your dining with us. </span>
<span sid='41933' title='41933'>It will be ready in half an hour. </span>
<span sid='41934' title='41934'>I have oysters and a brace of grouse, with something a little choice in white wines. </span>
<span sid='41935' title='41935'>Watson, you have never yet recognized my merits as a housekeeper.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41936' title='41936'>10. The End of the Islander</span>
<p>
<span sid='41937' title='41937'>Our meal was a merry one. </span>
<span sid='41938' title='41938'>Holmes could talk exceedingly well when he chose, and that night he did choose. </span>
<span sid='41939' title='41939'>He appeared to be in a state of nervous exaltation. </span>
<span sid='41940' title='41940'>I have never known him so brilliant. </span>
<span sid='41941' title='41941'>He spoke on a quick succession of subjects - on miracle plays, on mediæval pottery, on Stradivarius violins, on the Buddhism of Ceylon, and on the warships of the future - handling each as though he had made a special study of it. </span>
<span sid='41942' title='41942'>His bright humour marked the reaction from his black depression of the preceding days. </span>
<span sid='41943' title='41943'>Athelney Jones proved to be a sociable soul in his hours of relaxation, and faced his dinner with the air of a bon vivant. </span>
<span sid='41944' title='41944'>For myself, I felt elated at the thought that we were nearing the end of our task, and I caught something of Holmes's gaiety. </span>
<span sid='41945' title='41945'>None of us alluded during dinner to the cause which had brought us together.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41946' title='41946'>When the cloth was cleared, Holmes glanced at his watch, and filled up three glasses with port.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41947' title='41947'>'One bumper,' said he, 'to the success of our little expedition. </span>
<span sid='41948' title='41948'>And now it is high time we were off. </span>
<span sid='41949' title='41949'>Have you a pistol, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41950' title='41950'>'I have my old service-revolver in my desk.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41951' title='41951'>'You had best take it, then. </span>
<span sid='41952' title='41952'>It is well to be prepared. </span>
<span sid='41953' title='41953'>I see that the cab is at the door. </span>
<span sid='41954' title='41954'>I ordered it for half-past six.'</span>
<span sid='41955' title='41955'>It was a little past seven before we reached <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the West&t=h'>the West</a>minster Wharf, and found our launch awaiting us. </span>
<span sid='41956' title='41956'>Holmes eyed it critically.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41957' title='41957'>'Is there anything to mark it as a police-boat?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41958' title='41958'>'Yes; that green lamp at the side.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41959' title='41959'>'Then take it off.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41960' title='41960'>The small change was made, we stepped on board, and the ropes were cast off. </span>
<span sid='41961' title='41961'>Jones, Holmes, and I sat in the stern. </span>
<span sid='41962' title='41962'>There was one man at the rudder, one to tend the engines, and two burly police-inspectors forward.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41963' title='41963'>'Where to?' asked Jones.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41964' title='41964'>'To the Tower. </span>
<span sid='41965' title='41965'>Tell them to stop opposite to Jacobson's Yard.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41966' title='41966'>Our craft was evidently a very fast one. </span>
<span sid='41967' title='41967'>We shot past the long lines of loaded barges as though they were stationary. </span>
<span sid='41968' title='41968'>Holmes smiled with satisfaction as we overhauled a river steamer and left her behind us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41969' title='41969'>'We ought to be able to catch anything on the river,' he said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='41970' title='41970'>'Well, hardly that. </span>
<span sid='41971' title='41971'>But there are not many launches to beat us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41972' title='41972'>'We shall have to catch the Aurora, and she has a name for being a clipper. </span>
<span sid='41973' title='41973'>I will tell you how the land lies, Watson. </span>
<span sid='41974' title='41974'>You recollect how annoyed I was at being baulked by so small a thing?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41975' title='41975'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41976' title='41976'>'Well, I gave my mind a thorough rest by plunging into a chemical analysis. </span>
<span sid='41977' title='41977'>One of our greatest statesmen has said that a change of work is the best rest. </span>
<span sid='41978' title='41978'>So it is. </span>
<span sid='41979' title='41979'>When I had succeeded in dissolving the hydrocarbon which I was at work at, I came back to the problem of the Sholtos, and thought the whole matter out again. </span>
<span sid='41980' title='41980'>My boys had been up the river and down the river without result. </span>
<span sid='41981' title='41981'>The launch was not at any landing-stage or wharf, nor had it returned. </span>
<span sid='41982' title='41982'>Yet it could hardly have been scuttled to hide their traces, though that always remained as a possible hypothesis if all else failed. </span>
<span sid='41983' title='41983'>I knew that this man Small had a certain degree of low cunning, but I did not think him capable of anything in the nature of delicate finesse. </span>
<span sid='41984' title='41984'>That is usually a product of higher education. </span>
<span sid='41985' title='41985'>I then reflected that since he had certainly been in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> some time - as we had evidence that he maintained a continual watch over <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pondicherry&t=h'>Pondicherry</a> Lodge - he could hardly leave at a moment's notice, but would need some little time, if it were only a day, to arrange his affairs. </span>
<span sid='41986' title='41986'>That was the balance of probability, at any rate.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41987' title='41987'>'It seems to me to be a little weak,' said I: 'it is more probable that he had arranged his affairs before ever he set out upon his expedition.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41988' title='41988'>'No, I hardly think so. </span>
<span sid='41989' title='41989'>This lair of his would be too valuable a retreat in case of need for him to give it up until he was sure that he could do without it. </span>
<span sid='41990' title='41990'>But a second consideration struck me. </span>
<span sid='41991' title='41991'>Jonathan Small must have felt that the peculiar appearance of his companion, however much he may have top-coated him, would give rise to gossip, and possibly be associated with this <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a> tragedy. </span>
<span sid='41992' title='41992'>He was quite sharp enough to see that. </span>
<span sid='41993' title='41993'>They had started from their headquarters under cover of darkness, and he would wish to get back before it was broad light. </span>
<span sid='41994' title='41994'>Now, it was past three o'clock, according to Mrs. Smith, when they got the boat. </span>
<span sid='41995' title='41995'>It would be quite bright, and people would be about in an hour or so. </span>
<span sid='41996' title='41996'>Therefore, I argued, they did not go very far. </span>
<span sid='41997' title='41997'>They paid Smith well to hold his tongue, reserved his launch for the final escape, and hurried to their lodgings with the treasure-box. </span>
<span sid='41998' title='41998'>In a couple of nights, when they had time to see what view the papers took, and whether there was any suspicion, they would make their way under cover of darkness to some ship at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Gravesend&t=h'>Gravesend</a> or in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Downs&t=h'>the Downs</a>, where no doubt they had already arranged for passages to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a> or the Colonies.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='41999' title='41999'>'But the launch? </span>
<span sid='42000' title='42000'>They could not have taken that to their lodgings.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42001' title='42001'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='42002' title='42002'>I argued that the launch must be no great way off, in spite of its invisibility. </span>
<span sid='42003' title='42003'>I then put myself in the place of Small, and looked at it as a man of his capacity would. </span>
<span sid='42004' title='42004'>He would probably consider that to send back the launch or to keep it at a wharf would make pursuit easy if the police did happen to get on his track. </span>
<span sid='42005' title='42005'>How, then, could he conceal the launch and yet have her at hand when wanted? </span>
<span sid='42006' title='42006'>I wondered what I should do myself if I were in his shoes. </span>
<span sid='42007' title='42007'>I could only think of one way of doing it. </span>
<span sid='42008' title='42008'>I might hand the launch over to some boat-builder or repairer, with directions to make a trifling change in her. </span>
<span sid='42009' title='42009'>She would then be removed to his shed or yard, and so be effectually concealed, while at the same time I could have her at a few hours' notice.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42010' title='42010'>'That seems simple enough.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42011' title='42011'>'It is just these very simple things which are extremely liable to be overlooked. </span>
<span sid='42012' title='42012'>However, I determined to act on the idea. </span>
<span sid='42013' title='42013'>I started at once in this harmless seaman's rig, and inquired at all the yards down the river. </span>
<span sid='42014' title='42014'>I drew blank at fifteen, but at the sixteenth - Jacobson's - I learned that the Aurora had been handed over to them two days ago by a wooden-legged man, with some trivial directions as to her rudder. </span>
<span sid='42015' title='42015'>"There ain't naught amiss with her rudder," said the foreman. </span>
<span sid='42016' title='42016'>"There she lies, with the red streaks." </span>
<span sid='42017' title='42017'>At that moment who should come down but Mordecai Smith, the missing owner? </span>
<span sid='42018' title='42018'>He was rather the worse for liquor. </span>
<span sid='42019' title='42019'>I should not, of course, have known him, but he bellowed out his name and the name of his launch. </span>
<span sid='42020' title='42020'>"I want her to-night at eight o'clock," said he  - "eight o'clock sharp, mind, for I have two gentlemen who won't be kept waiting." </span>
<span sid='42021' title='42021'>They had evidently paid him well, for he was very flush of money, chucking shillings about to the men. </span>
<span sid='42022' title='42022'>I followed him some distance, but he subsided into an ale-house; so I went back to the yard, and, happening to pick up one of my boys on the way, I stationed him as a sentry over the launch. </span>
<span sid='42023' title='42023'>He is to stand at the water's edge and wave his handkerchief to us when they start. </span>
<span sid='42024' title='42024'>We shall be lying off in the stream, and it will be a strange thing if we do not take men, treasure and all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42025' title='42025'>'You have planned it all very neatly, whether they are the right men or not,' said Jones; 'but if the affair were in my hands I should have had a body of police in Jacobson's Yard, and arrested them when they came down.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42026' title='42026'>'Which would have been never. </span>
<span sid='42027' title='42027'>This man Small is a pretty shrewd fellow. </span>
<span sid='42028' title='42028'>He would send a scout on ahead, and if anything made him suspicious he would lie snug for another week.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42029' title='42029'>'But you might have stuck to Mordecai Smith, and so been led to their hiding-place,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42030' title='42030'>'In that case I should have wasted my day. </span>
<span sid='42031' title='42031'>I think that it is a hundred to one against Smith knowing where they live. </span>
<span sid='42032' title='42032'>As long as he has liquor and good pay, why should he ask questions? </span>
<span sid='42033' title='42033'>They send him messages what to do. </span>
<span sid='42034' title='42034'>No, I thought over every possible course, and this is the best.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42035' title='42035'>While this conversation had been proceeding, we had been shooting the long series of bridges which span the Thames. </span>
<span sid='42036' title='42036'>As we passed the City the last rays of the sun were gilding the cross upon the summit of St. Paul's. </span>
<span sid='42037' title='42037'>It was twilight before we reached the Tower.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42038' title='42038'>'That is Jacobson's Yard,' said Holmes, pointing to a bristle of masts and rigging on the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Surrey&t=h'>Surrey</a> side. </span>
<span sid='42039' title='42039'>'Cruise gently up and down here under cover of this string of lighters.' </span>
<span sid='42040' title='42040'>He took a pair of night-glasses from his pocket and gazed some time at the shore. </span>
<span sid='42041' title='42041'>'I see my sentry at his post,' he remarked, 'but no sign of a handkerchief.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42042' title='42042'>'Suppose we go downstream a short way and lie in wait for them,' said Jones, eagerly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42043' title='42043'>We were all eager by this time, even the policemen and stokers, who had a very vague idea of what was going forward.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42044' title='42044'>'We have no right to take anything for granted,' Holmes answered. </span>
<span sid='42045' title='42045'>'It is certainly ten to one that they go downstream, but we cannot be certain. </span>
<span sid='42046' title='42046'>From this point we can see the entrance of the yard, and they can hardly see us. </span>
<span sid='42047' title='42047'>It will be a clear night and plenty of light. </span>
<span sid='42048' title='42048'>We must stay where we are. </span>
<span sid='42049' title='42049'>See how the folk swarm over yonder in the gaslight.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42050' title='42050'>'They are coming from work in the yard.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42051' title='42051'>'Dirty-looking rascals, but I suppose everyone has some little immortal spark concealed about him. </span>
<span sid='42052' title='42052'>You would not think it, to look at them. </span>
<span sid='42053' title='42053'>There is no a priori probability about it. </span>
<span sid='42054' title='42054'>A strange enigma is man!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42055' title='42055'>'Someone calls him a soul concealed in an animal,' I suggested.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42056' title='42056'>'Winwood Reade is good upon the subject,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='42057' title='42057'>'He remarks that, while the individual man is an insoluble puzzle, in the aggregate he becomes a mathematical certainty. </span>
<span sid='42058' title='42058'>You can, for example, never foretell what any one man will do, but you can say with precision what an average number will be up to. </span>
<span sid='42059' title='42059'>Individuals vary, but percentages remain constant. </span>
<span sid='42060' title='42060'>So says the statistician. </span>
<span sid='42061' title='42061'>But do I see a handkerchief? </span>
<span sid='42062' title='42062'>Surely there is a white flutter over yonder.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42063' title='42063'>'Yes, it is your boy,' I cried. </span>
<span sid='42064' title='42064'>'I can see him plainly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42065' title='42065'>'And there is the Aurora,' exclaimed Holmes, 'and going like the devil! </span>
<span sid='42066' title='42066'>Full speed ahead, engineer. </span>
<span sid='42067' title='42067'>Make after that launch with the yellow light. </span>
<span sid='42068' title='42068'>By Heaven, I shall never forgive myself if she proves to have the heels of us!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42069' title='42069'>She had slipped unseen through the yard-entrance and passed behind two or three small craft, so that she had fairly got her speed up before we saw her. </span>
<span sid='42070' title='42070'>Now she was flying down the stream, near in to the shore, going at a tremendous rate. </span>
<span sid='42071' title='42071'>Jones looked gravely at her and shook his head.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42072' title='42072'>'She is very fast,' he said. </span>
<span sid='42073' title='42073'>'I doubt if we shall catch her.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42074' title='42074'>'We must catch her!' cried Holmes, between his teeth. </span>
<span sid='42075' title='42075'>'Heap it on, stokers! </span>
<span sid='42076' title='42076'>Make her do all she can! </span>
<span sid='42077' title='42077'>If we burn the boat we must have them!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42078' title='42078'>We were fairly after her now. </span>
<span sid='42079' title='42079'>The furnaces roared, and the powerful engines whizzed and clanked, like a great metallic heart. </span>
<span sid='42080' title='42080'>Her sharp, steep prow cut through the still river-water and sent two rolling waves to right and to left of us. </span>
<span sid='42081' title='42081'>With every throb of the engines we sprang and quivered like a living thing. </span>
<span sid='42082' title='42082'>One great yellow lantern in our bows threw a long, flickering funnel of light in front of us. </span>
<span sid='42083' title='42083'>Right ahead a dark blur upon the water showed where the Aurora lay, and the swirl of white foam behind her spoke of the pace at which she was going. </span>
<span sid='42084' title='42084'>We flashed past barges, steamers, merchant-vessels, in and out, behind this one and round the other. </span>
<span sid='42085' title='42085'>Voices hailed us out of the darkness, but still the Aurora thundered on, and still we followed close upon her track.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42086' title='42086'>'Pile it on, men, pile it on!' cried Holmes, looking down into the engine-room, while the fierce glow from below beat upon his eager, aquiline face. </span>
<span sid='42087' title='42087'>'Get every pound of steam you can.'</span>
<span sid='42088' title='42088'>'I think we gain a little,' said Jones, with his eyes on the Aurora.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42089' title='42089'>'I am sure of it,' said I. </span>
<span sid='42090' title='42090'>'We shall be up with her in a very few minutes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42091' title='42091'>At that moment, however, as our evil fate would have it, a tug with three barges in tow blundered in between us. </span>
<span sid='42092' title='42092'>It was only by putting our helm hard down that we avoided a collision, and before we could round them and recover our way the Aurora had gained a good two hundred yards. </span>
<span sid='42093' title='42093'>She was still, however, well in view, and the murky, uncertain twilight was settling into a clear, starlit night. </span>
<span sid='42094' title='42094'>Our boilers were strained to their utmost, and the frail shell vibrated and creaked with the fierce energy which was driving us along. </span>
<span sid='42095' title='42095'>We had shot through the Pool, past <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the West&t=h'>the West</a> India Docks, down the long Deptford Reach, and up again after rounding the Isle of Dogs. </span>
<span sid='42096' title='42096'>The dull blur in front of us resolved itself now clearly enough into the dainty Aurora. </span>
<span sid='42097' title='42097'>Jones turned our searchlight upon her, so that we could plainly see the figures upon her deck. </span>
<span sid='42098' title='42098'>One man sat by the stern, with something black between his knees, over which he stooped. </span>
<span sid='42099' title='42099'>Beside him lay a dark mass, which looked like a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Newfoundland&t=h'>Newfoundland</a> dog. </span>
<span sid='42100' title='42100'>The boy held the tiller, while against the red glare of the furnace I could see old Smith, stripped to the waist, and shovelling coals for dear life. </span>
<span sid='42101' title='42101'>They may have had some doubt at first as to whether we were really pursuing them, but now as we followed every winding and turning which they took there could no longer be any question about it. </span>
<span sid='42102' title='42102'>At <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Greenwich&t=h'>Greenwich</a> we were about three hundred paces behind them. </span>
<span sid='42103' title='42103'>At Blackwall we could not have been more than two hundred and fifty. </span>
<span sid='42104' title='42104'>I have coursed many creatures in many countries during my chequered career, but never did sport give me such a wild thrill as this mad, flying man-hunt down the Thames. </span>
<span sid='42105' title='42105'>Steadily we drew in upon them, yard by yard. </span>
<span sid='42106' title='42106'>In the silence of the night we could hear the panting and clanking of their machinery. </span>
<span sid='42107' title='42107'>The man in the stern still crouched upon the deck, and his arms were moving as though he were busy, while every now and then he would look up and measure with a glance the distance which still separated us. </span>
<span sid='42108' title='42108'>Nearer we came and nearer. </span>
<span sid='42109' title='42109'>Jones yelled to them to stop. </span>
<span sid='42110' title='42110'>We were not more than four boats' lengths behind them, both boats flying at a tremendous pace. </span>
<span sid='42111' title='42111'>It was a clear reach of the river, with Barking Level upon one side and the melancholy Plumstead Marshes upon the other. </span>
<span sid='42112' title='42112'>At our hail the man in the stern sprang up from the deck and shook his two clenched fists at us, cursing the while in a high, cracked voice. </span>
<span sid='42113' title='42113'>He was a good-sized, powerful man, and as he stood poising himself with legs astride, I could see that, from the thigh downwards, there was but a wooden stump upon the right side. </span>
<span sid='42114' title='42114'>At the sound of his strident, angry cries, there was a movement in the huddled bundle upon the deck. </span>
<span sid='42115' title='42115'>It straightened itself into a little black man - the smallest I have ever seen - with a great, misshapen head and a shock of tangled dishevelled hair. </span>
<span sid='42116' title='42116'>Holmes had already drawn his revolver, and I whipped out mine at the sight of this savage, distorted creature. </span>
<span sid='42117' title='42117'>He was wrapped in some sort of a dark ulster or blanket, which left only his face exposed; but that face was enough to give a man a sleepless night. </span>
<span sid='42118' title='42118'>Never have I seen features so deeply marked with all bestiality and cruelty. </span>
<span sid='42119' title='42119'>His small eyes glowed and burned with a sombre light, and his thick lips were writhed back from his teeth, which grinned and chattered at us with half-animal fury.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42120' title='42120'>'Fire if he raises his hand,' said Holmes quietly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42121' title='42121'>We were within a boat's-length by this time, and almost within touch of our quarry. </span>
<span sid='42122' title='42122'>I can see the two of them now as they stood: the white man with his legs far apart, shrieking out curses, and the unhallowed dwarf with his hideous face, and his strong, yellow teeth gnashing at us in the light of our lantern.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42123' title='42123'>It was well that we had so clear a view of him. </span>
<span sid='42124' title='42124'>Even as we looked he plucked out from under his covering a short, round piece of wood, like a school-ruler, and clapped it to his lips. </span>
<span sid='42125' title='42125'>Our pistols rang out together. </span>
<span sid='42126' title='42126'>He whirled round, threw up his arms, and, with a kind of choking cough, fell sideways into the stream. </span>
<span sid='42127' title='42127'>I caught one glimpse of his venomous, menacing eyes amid the white swirl of the waters. </span>
<span sid='42128' title='42128'>At the same moment the wooden-legged man threw himself upon the rudder and put it hard down, so that his boat made straight in for the southern bank, while we shot past her stern, only clearing her by a few feet. </span>
<span sid='42129' title='42129'>We were round after her in an instant, but she was already nearly at the bank. </span>
<span sid='42130' title='42130'>It was a wild and desolate place, where the moon glimmered upon a wide expanse of marsh-land, with pools of stagnant water and beds of decaying vegetation. </span>
<span sid='42131' title='42131'>The launch, with a dull thud, ran up upon the mud-bank, with her bow in the air and her stern flush with the water. </span>
<span sid='42132' title='42132'>The fugitive sprang out, but his stump instantly sank its whole length into the sodden soil. </span>
<span sid='42133' title='42133'>In vain he struggled and writhed. </span>
<span sid='42134' title='42134'>Not one step could he possibly take either forwards or backwards. </span>
<span sid='42135' title='42135'>He yelled in impotent rage, and kicked frantically into the mud with his other foot; but his struggles only bored his wooden pin the deeper into the sticky bank. </span>
<span sid='42136' title='42136'>When we brought our launch alongside he was so firmly anchored that it was only by throwing the end of a rope over his shoulders that we were able to haul him out, and to drag him, like some evil fish, over our side. </span>
<span sid='42137' title='42137'>The two Smiths, father and son, sat sullenly in their launch, but came aboard meekly enough when commanded. </span>
<span sid='42138' title='42138'>The Aurora herself we hauled off and made fast to our stern. </span>
<span sid='42139' title='42139'>A solid iron chest of Indian workmanship stood upon the deck. </span>
<span sid='42140' title='42140'>This, there could be no question, was the same that had contained the ill-omened treasure of the Sholtos. </span>
<span sid='42141' title='42141'>There was no key, but it was of considerable weight, so we transferred it carefully to our own little cabin. </span>
<span sid='42142' title='42142'>As we steamed slowly upstream again, we flashed our searchlight in every direction, but there was no sign of the Islander. </span>
<span sid='42143' title='42143'>Somewhere in the dark ooze at the bottom of the Thames lie the bones of that strange visitor to our shores.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42144' title='42144'>'See here,' said Holmes, pointing to the wooden hatchway. </span>
<span sid='42145' title='42145'>'We were hardly quick enough with our pistols.' </span>
<span sid='42146' title='42146'>There, sure enough, just behind where we had been standing, stuck one of those murderous darts which we knew so well. </span>
<span sid='42147' title='42147'>It must have whizzed between us at the instant we fired. </span>
<span sid='42148' title='42148'>Holmes smiled at it and shrugged his shoulders in his easy fashion, but I confess that it turned me sick to think of the horrible death which had passed so close to us that night.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42149' title='42149'>11. The Great <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Agra&t=h'>Agra</a> Treasure</span>
<p>
<span sid='42150' title='42150'>Our captive sat in the cabin opposite to the iron box which he had done so much and waited so long to gain. </span>
<span sid='42151' title='42151'>He was a sunburned, reckless-eyed fellow, with a network of lines and wrinkles all over his mahogany features, which told of a hard, open-air life. </span>
<span sid='42152' title='42152'>There was a singular prominence about his bearded chin which marked a man who was not to be easily turned from his purpose. </span>
<span sid='42153' title='42153'>His age may have been fifty or thereabouts, for his black, curly hair was thickly shot with grey. </span>
<span sid='42154' title='42154'>His face in repose was not an unpleasing one, though his heavy brows and aggressive chin gave him, as I had lately seen, a terrible expression when moved to anger. </span>
<span sid='42155' title='42155'>He sat now with his handcuffed hands upon his lap, and his head sunk upon his breast, while he looked with his keen, twinkling eyes at the box which had been the cause of his ill-doings. </span>
<span sid='42156' title='42156'>It seemed to me that there was more sorrow than anger in his rigid and contained countenance. </span>
<span sid='42157' title='42157'>Once he looked up at me with a gleam of something like humour in his eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42158' title='42158'>'Well, Jonathan Small,' said Holmes, lighting a cigar, 'I am sorry that it has come to this.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42159' title='42159'>'And so am I, sir,' he answered, frankly. </span>
<span sid='42160' title='42160'>'I don't believe that I can swing over the job. </span>
<span sid='42161' title='42161'>I give you my word on the Book that I never raised hand against Mr. Sholto. </span>
<span sid='42162' title='42162'>It was that little hell-hound Tonga who shot one of his cursed darts into him. </span>
<span sid='42163' title='42163'>I had no part in it, sir. </span>
<span sid='42164' title='42164'>I was as grieved as if it had been my bloodrelation. </span>
<span sid='42165' title='42165'>I welted the little devil with the slack end of the rope for it, but it was done, and I could not undo it again.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42166' title='42166'>'Have a cigar,' said Holmes; 'and you had best take a pull out of my flask, for you are very wet. </span>
<span sid='42167' title='42167'>How could you expect so small and weak a man as this black fellow to overpower Mr. Sholto and hold him while you were climbing the rope?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42168' title='42168'>'You seem to know as much about it as if you were there, sir. </span>
<span sid='42169' title='42169'>The truth is that I hoped to find the room clear. </span>
<span sid='42170' title='42170'>I knew the habits of the house pretty well, and it was the time when Mr. Sholto usually went down to his supper. </span>
<span sid='42171' title='42171'>I shall make no secret of the business. </span>
<span sid='42172' title='42172'>The best defence that I can make is just the simple truth. </span>
<span sid='42173' title='42173'>Now, if it had been the old major I would have swung for him with a light heart. </span>
<span sid='42174' title='42174'>I would have thought no more of knifing him than of smoking this cigar. </span>
<span sid='42175' title='42175'>But it's cursed hard that I should be lagged over this young Sholto, with whom I had no quarrel whatever.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42176' title='42176'>'You are under the charge of Mr. Athelney Jones, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>. </span>
<span sid='42177' title='42177'>He is going to bring you up to my rooms, and I shall ask you for a true account of the matter. </span>
<span sid='42178' title='42178'>You must make a clean breast of it, for if you do I hope that I may be of use to you. </span>
<span sid='42179' title='42179'>I think I can prove that the poison acts so quickly that the man was dead before ever you reached the room.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42180' title='42180'>'That he was, sir. </span>
<span sid='42181' title='42181'>I never got such a turn in my life as when I saw him grinning at me with his head on his shoulder as I climbed through the window. </span>
<span sid='42182' title='42182'>It fairly shook me, sir. </span>
<span sid='42183' title='42183'>I'd have half killed Tonga for it if he had not scrambled off. </span>
<span sid='42184' title='42184'>That was how he came to leave his club, and some of his darts, too, as he tells me, which I dare say helped to put you on our track; though how you kept on it is more than I can tell. </span>
<span sid='42185' title='42185'>I don't feel no malice against you for it. </span>
<span sid='42186' title='42186'>But it does seem a queer thing,' he added, with a bitter smile, 'that I, who have a fair claim to half a million of money, should spend the first half of my life building a breakwater in the Andamans, and am like to spend the other half digging drains at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Dartmoor&t=h'>Dartmoor</a>. </span>
<span sid='42187' title='42187'>It was an evil day for me when first I clapped eyes upon the merchant Achmet and had to do with the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Agra&t=h'>Agra</a> treasure, which never brought anything but a curse yet upon the man who owned it. </span>
<span sid='42188' title='42188'>To him, it brought murder, to Major Sholto it brought fear and guilt, to me it has meant slavery for life.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42189' title='42189'>At this moment Athelney Jones thrust his face and shoulders into the tiny cabin.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42190' title='42190'>'Quite a family party,' he remarked. </span>
<span sid='42191' title='42191'>'I think I shall have a pull at that flask, Holmes. </span>
<span sid='42192' title='42192'>Well, I think we may all congratulate each other. </span>
<span sid='42193' title='42193'>Pity we didn't take the other alive; but there was no choice. </span>
<span sid='42194' title='42194'>I say, Holmes, you must confess that you cut it rather fine. </span>
<span sid='42195' title='42195'>It was all we could do to overhaul her.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42196' title='42196'>'All is well that ends well,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='42197' title='42197'>'But I certainly did not know that the Aurora was such a dipper.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42198' title='42198'>'Smith says she is one of the fastest launches on the river, and that if he had had another man to help him with the engines we should never have caught her. </span>
<span sid='42199' title='42199'>He swears he knew nothing of this <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a> business.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42200' title='42200'>'Neither he did,' cried our prisoner - 'not a word. </span>
<span sid='42201' title='42201'>I chose his launch because I heard that she was a flier. </span>
<span sid='42202' title='42202'>We told him nothing; but we paid him well, and he was to get something handsome if we reached our vessel, the Esmeralda, at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Gravesend&t=h'>Gravesend</a>, outward bound for the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brazil&t=h'>Brazil</a>s.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42203' title='42203'>'Well, if he has done no wrong we shall see that no wrong comes to him. </span>
<span sid='42204' title='42204'>If we are pretty quick in catching our men, we are not so quick in condemning them.' </span>
<span sid='42205' title='42205'>It was amusing to notice how the consequential Jones was already beginning to give himself airs on the strength of the capture. </span>
<span sid='42206' title='42206'>From the slight smile which played over Sherlock Holmes's face, I could see that the speech had not been lost upon him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42207' title='42207'>'We will be at Vauxhall Bridge presently,' said Jones, 'and shall land you, Dr. Watson, with the treasure-box. </span>
<span sid='42208' title='42208'>I need hardly tell you that I am taking a very grave responsibility upon myself in doing this. </span>
<span sid='42209' title='42209'>It is most irregular; but of course an agreement is an agreement. </span>
<span sid='42210' title='42210'>I must, however, as a matter of duty, send an inspector with you, since you have so valuable a charge. </span>
<span sid='42211' title='42211'>You will drive, no doubt?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42212' title='42212'>'Yes, I shall drive.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42213' title='42213'>'It is a pity there is no key, that we may make an inventory first. </span>
<span sid='42214' title='42214'>You will have to break it open. </span>
<span sid='42215' title='42215'>Where is the key, my man?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42216' title='42216'>'At the bottom of the river,' said Small shortly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42217' title='42217'>'Hum! </span>
<span sid='42218' title='42218'>There was no use your giving this unnecessary trouble. </span>
<span sid='42219' title='42219'>We have had work enough already through you. </span>
<span sid='42220' title='42220'>However, doctor, I need not warn you to be careful. </span>
<span sid='42221' title='42221'>Bring the box back with you to the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> rooms. </span>
<span sid='42222' title='42222'>You will find us there, on our way to the station.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42223' title='42223'>They landed me at Vauxhall, with my heavy iron box, and with a bluff, genial inspector as my companion. </span>
<span sid='42224' title='42224'>A quarter of an hour's drive brought us to Mrs. Cecil Forrester's. </span>
<span sid='42225' title='42225'>The servant seemed surprised at so late a visitor. </span>
<span sid='42226' title='42226'>Mrs. Cecil Forrester was out for the evening, she explained, and likely to be very late. </span>
<span sid='42227' title='42227'>Miss Morstan however, was in the drawing-room; so to the drawing-room I went, box in hand, leaving the obliging inspector in the cab.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42228' title='42228'>She was seated by the open window, dressed in some sort of white diaphanous material, with a little touch of scarlet at the neck and waist. </span>
<span sid='42229' title='42229'>The soft light of a shaded lamp fell upon her as she leaned back in the basket chair, playing over her sweet, grave face, and tinting with a dull, metallic sparkle the rich coils of her luxuriant hair. </span>
<span sid='42230' title='42230'>One white arm and hand drooped over the side of the chair, and her whole pose and figure spoke of an absorbing melancholy. </span>
<span sid='42231' title='42231'>At the sound of my footfall she sprang to her feet, however, and a bright flush of surprise and of pleasure coloured her pale cheeks.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42232' title='42232'>'I heard a cab drive up,' she said. </span>
<span sid='42233' title='42233'>'I thought that Mrs. Forrester had come back very early, but I never dreamed that it might be you. </span>
<span sid='42234' title='42234'>What news have you brought me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42235' title='42235'>'I have brought something better than news,' said I, putting down the box upon the table and speaking jovially and boisterously, though my heart was heavy within me. </span>
<span sid='42236' title='42236'>'I have brought you something which is worth all the news in the world. </span>
<span sid='42237' title='42237'>I have brought you a fortune.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42238' title='42238'>She glanced at the iron box.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42239' title='42239'>'Is that the treasure, then?' she asked, coolly enough.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42240' title='42240'>'Yes, this is the great <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Agra&t=h'>Agra</a> treasure. </span>
<span sid='42241' title='42241'>Half of it is yours and half is Thaddeus Sholto's. </span>
<span sid='42242' title='42242'>You will have a couple of hundred thousand each. </span>
<span sid='42243' title='42243'>Think of that! </span>
<span sid='42244' title='42244'>An annuity of ten thousand pounds. </span>
<span sid='42245' title='42245'>There will be few richer young ladies in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>. </span>
<span sid='42246' title='42246'>Is it not glorious?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42247' title='42247'>I think that I must have been rather overacting my delight, and that she detected a hollow ring in my congratulations, for I saw her eyebrows rise a little, and she glanced at me curiously.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42248' title='42248'>'If I have it,' said she, 'I owe it to you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42249' title='42249'>'No, no,' I answered, 'not to me, but to my friend Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='42250' title='42250'>With all the will in the world, I could never have followed up a clue which has taxed even his analytical genius. </span>
<span sid='42251' title='42251'>As it was, we very nearly lost it at the last moment.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42252' title='42252'>'Pray sit down and tell me all about it, Dr. Watson,' said she.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42253' title='42253'>I narrated briefly what had occurred since I had seen her last. </span>
<span sid='42254' title='42254'>Holmes's new method of search, the discovery of the Aurora, the appearance of Athelney Jones, our expedition in the evening, and the wild chase down the Thames. </span>
<span sid='42255' title='42255'>She listened with parted lips and shining eyes to my recital of our adventures. </span>
<span sid='42256' title='42256'>When I spoke of the dart which had so narrowly missed us, she turned so white that I feared that she was about to faint.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42257' title='42257'>'It is nothing,' she said, as I hastened to pour her out some water. </span>
<span sid='42258' title='42258'>'I am all right again. </span>
<span sid='42259' title='42259'>It was a shock to me to hear that I had placed my friends in such horrible peril.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42260' title='42260'>'That is all over,' I answered. </span>
<span sid='42261' title='42261'>'It was nothing. </span>
<span sid='42262' title='42262'>I will tell you no more gloomy details. </span>
<span sid='42263' title='42263'>Let us turn to something brighter. </span>
<span sid='42264' title='42264'>There is the treasure. </span>
<span sid='42265' title='42265'>What could be brighter than that? </span>
<span sid='42266' title='42266'>I got leave to bring it with me, thinking that it would interest you to be the first to see it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42267' title='42267'>'It would be of the greatest interest to me,' she said. </span>
<span sid='42268' title='42268'>There was no eagerness in her voice, however. </span>
<span sid='42269' title='42269'>It had struck her, doubtless, that it might seem ungracious upon her part to be indifferent to a prize which had cost so much to win.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42270' title='42270'>'What a pretty box!' she said, stooping over it. </span>
<span sid='42271' title='42271'>'This is Indian work, I suppose?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42272' title='42272'>'Yes; it is Benares metal-work.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42273' title='42273'>'And so heavy!' she exclaimed, trying to raise it. </span>
<span sid='42274' title='42274'>'The box alone must be of some value. </span>
<span sid='42275' title='42275'>Where is the key?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42276' title='42276'>'Small threw it into the Thames,' I answered. </span>
<span sid='42277' title='42277'>'I must borrow Mrs. Forrester's poker.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42278' title='42278'>There was in the front a thick and broad hasp, wrought in the image of a sitting Buddha. </span>
<span sid='42279' title='42279'>Under this I thrust the end of the poker and twisted it outward as a lever. </span>
<span sid='42280' title='42280'>The hasp sprang open with a loud snap. </span>
<span sid='42281' title='42281'>With trembling fingers I flung back the lid. </span>
<span sid='42282' title='42282'>We both stood gazing in astonishment. </span>
<span sid='42283' title='42283'>The box was empty!</span>
<p>
<span sid='42284' title='42284'>No wonder that it was heavy. </span>
<span sid='42285' title='42285'>The iron-work was two-thirds of an inch thick all round. </span>
<span sid='42286' title='42286'>It was massive, well made, and solid, like a chest constructed to carry things of great price, but not one shred or crumb of metal or jewellery lay within it. </span>
<span sid='42287' title='42287'>It was absolutely and completely empty.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42288' title='42288'>'The treasure is lost,' said Miss Morstan, calmly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42289' title='42289'>As I listened to the words and realized what they meant, a great shadow seemed to pass from my soul. </span>
<span sid='42290' title='42290'>I did not know how this <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Agra&t=h'>Agra</a> treasure had weighed me down, until now that it was finally removed. </span>
<span sid='42291' title='42291'>It was selfish, no doubt, disloyal, wrong, but I could realize nothing save that the golden barrier was gone from between us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42292' title='42292'>'Thank God!' I ejaculated from my very heart.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42293' title='42293'>She looked at me with a quick, questioning smile.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42294' title='42294'>'Why do you say that?' she asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42295' title='42295'>'Because you are within my reach again,' I said, taking her hand. </span>
<span sid='42296' title='42296'>She did not withdraw it. </span>
<span sid='42297' title='42297'>'Because I love you, Mary, as truly as ever a man loved a woman. </span>
<span sid='42298' title='42298'>Because this treasure, these riches, sealed my lips. </span>
<span sid='42299' title='42299'>Now that they are gone I can tell you how I love you. </span>
<span sid='42300' title='42300'>That is why I said, "Thank God."'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42301' title='42301'>'Then I say "Thank God," too,' she whispered, as I drew her to my side.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42302' title='42302'>Whoever had lost a treasure, I knew that night that I had gained one.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42303' title='42303'>12. The Strange Story of Jonathan Small</span>
<p>
<span sid='42304' title='42304'>A very patient man was that inspector in the cab, for it was a weary time before I rejoined him. </span>
<span sid='42305' title='42305'>His face clouded over when I showed him the empty box.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42306' title='42306'>'There goes the reward!' said he, gloomily. </span>
<span sid='42307' title='42307'>'Where there is no money there is no pay. </span>
<span sid='42308' title='42308'>This night's work would have been worth a tenner each to Sam Brown and me if the treasure had been there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42309' title='42309'>'Mr. Thaddeus Sholto is a rich man,' I said; 'he will see that you are rewarded, treasure or no.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42310' title='42310'>The inspector shook his head despondently, however.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42311' title='42311'>'It's a bad job,' he repeated; 'and so Mr. Athelney Jones will think.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42312' title='42312'>His forecast proved to be correct, for the detective looked blank enough when I got to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> and showed him the empty box. </span>
<span sid='42313' title='42313'>They had only just arrived, Holmes, the prisoner, and he, for they had changed their plans so far as to report themselves at a station upon the way. </span>
<span sid='42314' title='42314'>My companion lounged in his arm-chair with his usual listless expression, while Small sat stolidly opposite to him with his wooden leg cocked over his sound one. </span>
<span sid='42315' title='42315'>As I exhibited the empty box he leaned back in his chair and laughed aloud.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42316' title='42316'>'This is your doing, Small,' said Athelney Jones, angrily.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42317' title='42317'>'Yes, I have put it away where you shall never lay hand on it,' he cried, exultantly. </span>
<span sid='42318' title='42318'>'It is my treasure, and if I can't have the loot I'll take darned good care that no one else does. </span>
<span sid='42319' title='42319'>I tell you that no living man has any right to it, unless it is three men who are in the Andaman convict-barracks and myself. </span>
<span sid='42320' title='42320'>I know now that I cannot have the use of it, and I know that they cannot. </span>
<span sid='42321' title='42321'>I have acted all through for them as much as for myself. </span>
<span sid='42322' title='42322'>It's been the sign of four with us always. </span>
<span sid='42323' title='42323'>Well, I know that they would have had me do just what I have done, and throw the treasure into the Thames rather than let it go to kith or kin of Sholto or Morstan. </span>
<span sid='42324' title='42324'>It was not to make them rich that we did for Achmet. </span>
<span sid='42325' title='42325'>You'll find the treasure where the key is, and where little Tonga is. </span>
<span sid='42326' title='42326'>When I saw that your launch must catch us, I put the loot away in a safe place. </span>
<span sid='42327' title='42327'>There are no rupees for you this journey.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42328' title='42328'>'You are deceiving us, Small,' said Athelney Jones, sternly. </span>
<span sid='42329' title='42329'>'If you had wished to throw the treasure into the Thames, it would have been easier for you to have thrown box and all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42330' title='42330'>'Easier for me to throw, and easier for you to recover,' he answered, with a shrewd, side-long look. </span>
<span sid='42331' title='42331'>'The man that was clever enough to hunt me down is clever enough to pick an iron box from the bottom of a river. </span>
<span sid='42332' title='42332'>Now that they are scattered over five miles or so, it may be a harder job. </span>
<span sid='42333' title='42333'>It went to my heart to do it, though. </span>
<span sid='42334' title='42334'>I was half mad when you came up with us. </span>
<span sid='42335' title='42335'>However, there's no good grieving over it. </span>
<span sid='42336' title='42336'>I've had ups in my life, and I've had downs, but I've learned not to cry over spilled milk.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42337' title='42337'>'This is a very serious matter, Small,' said the detective. </span>
<span sid='42338' title='42338'>'If you had helped justice, instead of thwarting it in this way, you would have had a better chance at your trial.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42339' title='42339'>'Justice!' snarled the ex-convict. </span>
<span sid='42340' title='42340'>'A pretty justice! </span>
<span sid='42341' title='42341'>Whose loot is this, if it is not ours? </span>
<span sid='42342' title='42342'>Where is the justice that I should give it up to those who have never earned it? </span>
<span sid='42343' title='42343'>Look how I have earned it! </span>
<span sid='42344' title='42344'>Twenty long years in that fever-ridden swamp, all day at work under the mangrove-tree, all night chained up in the filthy convict-huts, bitten by mosquitoes, racked with ague, bullied by every cursed black-faced policeman who loved to take it out of a white man. </span>
<span sid='42345' title='42345'>That was how I earned the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Agra&t=h'>Agra</a> treasure, and you talk to me of justice because I cannot bear to feel that I have paid this price only that another may enjoy it! </span>
<span sid='42346' title='42346'>I would rather swing a score of times, or have one of Tonga's darts in my hide, than live in a convict's cell and feel that another man is at his ease in a palace with the money that should be mine.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42347' title='42347'>Small had dropped his mask of stoicism, and all this came out in a wild whirl of words, while his eyes blazed and the handcuffs clanked together with the impassioned movement of his hands. </span>
<span sid='42348' title='42348'>I could understand, as I saw the fury and the passion of the man, that it was no groundless or unnatural terror which had possessed Major Sholto when he first learned that the injured convict was upon his track.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42349' title='42349'>'You forget that we know nothing of all this,' said Holmes, quietly. </span>
<span sid='42350' title='42350'>'We have not heard your story, and we cannot tell how far justice may originally have been on your side.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42351' title='42351'>'Well, sir, you have been very fair-spoken to me, though I can see that I have you to thank that I have these bracelets upon my wrists. </span>
<span sid='42352' title='42352'>Still, I bear no grudge for that. </span>
<span sid='42353' title='42353'>It is all fair and above-board. </span>
<span sid='42354' title='42354'>If you want to hear my story, I have no wish to hold it back. </span>
<span sid='42355' title='42355'>What I say to you is God's truth, every word of it. </span>
<span sid='42356' title='42356'>Thank you, you can put the glass beside me here, and I'll put my lips to it if I am dry.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42357' title='42357'>'I am a Worcestershire man myself, born near Pershore. </span>
<span sid='42358' title='42358'>I dare say you would find a heap of Smalls living there now if you were to look. </span>
<span sid='42359' title='42359'>I have often thought of taking a look round there, but the truth is that I was never much of a credit to the family, and I doubt if they would be so very glad to see me. </span>
<span sid='42360' title='42360'>They were all steady, chapel-going folk, small farmers, well known and respected over the country-side, while I was always a bit of a rover. </span>
<span sid='42361' title='42361'>At last, however, when I was about eighteen, I gave them no more trouble, for I got into a mess over a girl, and could only get out of it again by taking the Queen's shilling and joining the 3rd Buffs, which was just starting for India.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42362' title='42362'>'I wasn't destined to do much soldiering, however. </span>
<span sid='42363' title='42363'>I had just got past the goose-step, and learned to handle my musket, when I was fool enough to go swimming in the Ganges. </span>
<span sid='42364' title='42364'>Luckily for me, my company sergeant, John Holder, was in the water at the same time, and he was one of the finest swimmers in the Service. </span>
<span sid='42365' title='42365'>A crocodile took me, just as I was halfway across, and nipped off my right leg as clean as a surgeon could have done it, just above the knee. </span>
<span sid='42366' title='42366'>What with the shock and the loss of blood, I fainted, and should have been drowned if Holder had not caught hold of me and paddled for the bank. </span>
<span sid='42367' title='42367'>I was five months in hospital over it, and when at last I was able to limp out of it with this timber toe strapped to my stump I found myself invalided out of the army and unfitted for any active occupation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42368' title='42368'>'I was, as you can imagine, pretty down on my luck at this time, for I was a useless cripple, though not yet in my twentieth year. </span>
<span sid='42369' title='42369'>However, my misfortune soon proved to be a blessing in disguise. </span>
<span sid='42370' title='42370'>A man named Abel White, who had come out there as an indigo-planter, wanted an overseer to look after his coolies and keep them up to their work. </span>
<span sid='42371' title='42371'>He happened to be a friend of our colonel's who had taken an interest in me since the accident. </span>
<span sid='42372' title='42372'>To make a long story short, the colonel recommended me strongly for the post, and, as the work was mostly to be done on horseback, my leg was no great obstacle, for I had enough knee left to keep a good grip on the saddle. </span>
<span sid='42373' title='42373'>What I had to do was to ride over the plantation, to keep an eye on the men as they worked, and to report the idlers. </span>
<span sid='42374' title='42374'>The pay was fair, I had comfortable quarters, and altogether I was content to spend the remainder of my life in indigo-planting. </span>
<span sid='42375' title='42375'>Mr. Abel White was a kind man, and he would often drop into my little shanty and smoke a pipe with me, for white folk out there feel their hearts warm to each other as they never do here at home.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42376' title='42376'>'Well, I was never in luck's way long. </span>
<span sid='42377' title='42377'>Suddenly, without a note of warning, the great mutiny broke upon us. </span>
<span sid='42378' title='42378'>One month India lay as still and peaceful, to all appearance, as <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Surrey&t=h'>Surrey</a> or <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kent&t=h'>Kent</a>; the next there were two hundred thousand black devils let loose, and the country was a perfect hell. </span>
<span sid='42379' title='42379'>Of course you know all about it, gentlemen - a deal more than I do, very like, since reading is not in my line. </span>
<span sid='42380' title='42380'>I only know what I saw with my own eyes. </span>
<span sid='42381' title='42381'>Our plantation was at a place called Muttra, near the border of the Northwest Provinces. </span>
<span sid='42382' title='42382'>Night after night the whole sky was alight with the burning bungalows, and day after day we had small companies of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>ans passing through our estate with their wives and children, on their way to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Agra&t=h'>Agra</a>, where were the nearest troops. </span>
<span sid='42383' title='42383'>Mr. Abel White was an obstinate man. </span>
<span sid='42384' title='42384'>He had it in his head that the affair had been exaggerated, and that it would blow over as suddenly as it had sprung up. </span>
<span sid='42385' title='42385'>There he sat on his veranda, drinking whisky-pegs and smoking cheroots, while the country was in a blaze about him. </span>
<span sid='42386' title='42386'>Of course, we stuck by him, I and Dawson, who, with his wife, used to do the book-work and the managing. </span>
<span sid='42387' title='42387'>Well, one fine day the crash came. </span>
<span sid='42388' title='42388'>I had been away on a distant plantation, and was riding slowly home in the evening, when my eye fell upon something all huddled together at the bottom of a steep nullah. </span>
<span sid='42389' title='42389'>I rode down to see what it was, and the cold struck through my heart when I found it was Dawson's wife, all cut into ribbons and half-eaten by jackals and native dogs. </span>
<span sid='42390' title='42390'>A little farther up the road Dawson himself was lying on his face, quite dead, with an empty revolver in his hand, and four Sepoys lying across each other in front of him. </span>
<span sid='42391' title='42391'>I reined up my horse, wondering which way I should turn; but at that moment I saw thick smoke curling up from Abel White's bungalow, and the flames beginning to burst through the roof. </span>
<span sid='42392' title='42392'>I knew then that I could do my employer no good, but would only throw my own life away if I meddled in the matter. </span>
<span sid='42393' title='42393'>From where I stood I could see hundreds of the black fiends, with their red coats still on their backs, dancing and howling round the burning house. </span>
<span sid='42394' title='42394'>Some of them pointed at me, and a couple of bullets sang past my head: so I broke away across the paddy-fields, and found myself late at night safe within the walls at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Agra&t=h'>Agra</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42395' title='42395'>'As it proved, however, there was no great safety here, either. </span>
<span sid='42396' title='42396'>The whole country was up like a swarm of bees. </span>
<span sid='42397' title='42397'>Wherever the English could collect in little bands, they held just the ground that their guns commanded. </span>
<span sid='42398' title='42398'>Everywhere else they were helpless fugitives. </span>
<span sid='42399' title='42399'>It was a fight of the millions against the hundreds; and the cruellest part of it was that these men that we fought against, foot, horse, and gunners, were our own picked troops, whom we had taught and trained, handling our own weapons and blowing our own bugle-calls. </span>
<span sid='42400' title='42400'>At <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Agra&t=h'>Agra</a> there were the 3rd <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bengal&t=h'>Bengal</a> Fusiliers, some Sikhs, two troops of horse, and a battery of artillery. </span>
<span sid='42401' title='42401'>A volunteer corps of clerks and merchants had been formed, and this I joined, wooden leg and all. </span>
<span sid='42402' title='42402'>We went out to meet the rebels at Shahgunge early in July, and we beat them back for a time, but our powder gave out, and we had to fall back upon the city.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42403' title='42403'>'Nothing but the worst news came to us from every side - which is not to be wondered at, for if you look at the map you will see that we were right in the heart of it. </span>
<span sid='42404' title='42404'>Lucknow is rather better than a hundred miles to the east, and Cawnpore about as far to the south. </span>
<span sid='42405' title='42405'>From every point on the compass there was nothing but torture and murder and outrage.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42406' title='42406'>'The city of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Agra&t=h'>Agra</a> is a great place, swarming with fanatics and fierce devil-worshippers of all sorts. </span>
<span sid='42407' title='42407'>Our handful of men were lost among the narrow, winding streets. </span>
<span sid='42408' title='42408'>Our leader moved across the river, therefore, and took up his position in the old fort of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Agra&t=h'>Agra</a>. </span>
<span sid='42409' title='42409'>I don't know if any of you gentlemen have ever read or heard anything of that old fort. </span>
<span sid='42410' title='42410'>It is a very queer place - the queerest that ever I was in, and I have been in some rum corners, too. </span>
<span sid='42411' title='42411'>First of all, it is enormous in size. </span>
<span sid='42412' title='42412'>I should think that the enclosure must be acres and acres. </span>
<span sid='42413' title='42413'>There is a modern part, which took all our garrison, women, children, stores, and everything else, with plenty of room over. </span>
<span sid='42414' title='42414'>But the modern part is nothing like the size of the old quarter, where nobody goes, and which is given over to the scorpions and the centipedes. </span>
<span sid='42415' title='42415'>It is all full of great, deserted halls, and winding passages, and long corridors twisting in and out, so that it is easy enough for folk to get lost in it. </span>
<span sid='42416' title='42416'>For this reason it was seldom that anyone went into it, though now and again a party with torches might go exploring.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42417' title='42417'>'The river washes along the front of the old fort, and so protects it, but on the sides and behind there are many doors, and these had to be guarded, of course, in the old quarter as well as in that which was actually held by our troops. </span>
<span sid='42418' title='42418'>We were short-handed, with hardly men enough to man the angles of the building and to serve the guns. </span>
<span sid='42419' title='42419'>It was impossible for us, therefore, to station a strong guard at every one of the innumerable gates. </span>
<span sid='42420' title='42420'>What we did was to organize a central guard-house in the middle of the fort, and to leave each gate under the charge of one white man and two or three natives. </span>
<span sid='42421' title='42421'>I was selected to take charge during certain hours of the night of a small isolated door upon the south-west side of the building. </span>
<span sid='42422' title='42422'>Two Sikh troopers were placed under my command, and I was instructed if anything went wrong to fire my musket, when I might rely upon help coming at once from the central guard. </span>
<span sid='42423' title='42423'>As the guard was a good two hundred paces away, however, and as the space between was cut up into a labyrinth of passages and corridors, I had great doubts as to whether they could arrive in time to be of any use in case of an actual attack.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42424' title='42424'>'Well, I was pretty proud at having this small command given me, since I was a raw recruit, and a game-legged one at that. </span>
<span sid='42425' title='42425'>For two nights I kept the watch with my Punjaubees. </span>
<span sid='42426' title='42426'>They were tall, fierce-looking chaps, Mahomet Singh and Abdullah Khan by name, both old fighting-men, who had borne arms against us at Chilian Wallah. </span>
<span sid='42427' title='42427'>They could talk English pretty well, but I could get little out of them. </span>
<span sid='42428' title='42428'>They preferred to stand together and jabber all night in their queer Sikh lingo. </span>
<span sid='42429' title='42429'>For myself, I used to stand outside the gateway looking down on the broad, winding river and on the twinkling lights of the great city. </span>
<span sid='42430' title='42430'>The beating of drums, the rattle of tom-toms, and the yells and howls of the rebels, drunk with opium and with bang, were enough to remind us all night of our dangerous neighbours across the stream. </span>
<span sid='42431' title='42431'>Every two hours the officer of the night used to come round to all the posts, to make sure that all was well.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42432' title='42432'>'The third night of my watch was dark and dirty, with a small, driving rain. </span>
<span sid='42433' title='42433'>It was dreary work standing in the gateway hour after hour in such weather. </span>
<span sid='42434' title='42434'>I tried again and again to make my Sikhs talk, but without much success. </span>
<span sid='42435' title='42435'>At two in the morning the rounds passed, and broke for a moment the weariness of the night. </span>
<span sid='42436' title='42436'>Finding that my companions would not be led into conversation, I took out my pipe, and laid down my musket to strike a match. </span>
<span sid='42437' title='42437'>In an instant the two Sikhs were upon me. </span>
<span sid='42438' title='42438'>One of them snatched my firelock up and levelled it at my head, while the other held a great knife to my throat and swore between his teeth that he would plunge it into me if I moved a step.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42439' title='42439'>'My first thought was that these fellows were in league with the rebels, and that this was the beginning of an assault. </span>
<span sid='42440' title='42440'>If our door were in the hands of the Sepoys the place must fall, and the women and children be treated as they were in Cawnpore. </span>
<span sid='42441' title='42441'>Maybe you gentlemen think that I am just making out a case for myself, but I give you my word that when I thought of that, though I felt the point of the knife at my throat, I opened my mouth with the intention of giving a scream, if it was my last one, which might alarm the main guard. </span>
<span sid='42442' title='42442'>The man who held me seemed to know my thoughts; for, even as I braced myself to it, he whispered: </span>
<span sid='42443' title='42443'>"Don't make a noise. </span>
<span sid='42444' title='42444'>The fort is safe enough. </span>
<span sid='42445' title='42445'>There are no rebel dogs on this side of the river." </span>
<span sid='42446' title='42446'>There was the ring of truth in what he said, and I knew that if I raised my voice I was a dead man. </span>
<span sid='42447' title='42447'>I could read it in the fellow's brown eyes. </span>
<span sid='42448' title='42448'>I waited, therefore, in silence, to see what it was that they wanted from me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42449' title='42449'>'"Listen to me, Sahib," said the taller and fiercer of the pair, the one whom they called Abdullah Khan. </span>
<span sid='42450' title='42450'>"You must either be with us now, or you must be silenced for ever. </span>
<span sid='42451' title='42451'>The thing is too great a one for us to hesitate. </span>
<span sid='42452' title='42452'>Either you are heart and soul with us on your oath on the cross of the Christians, or your body this night shall be thrown into the ditch, and we shall pass over to our brothers in the rebel army. </span>
<span sid='42453' title='42453'>There is no middle way. </span>
<span sid='42454' title='42454'>Which is it to be - death or life? </span>
<span sid='42455' title='42455'>We can only give you three minutes to decide, for the time is passing, and all must be done before the rounds come again."</span>
<p>
<span sid='42456' title='42456'>'"How can I decide?" said I. </span>
<span sid='42457' title='42457'>"You have not told me what you want of me. </span>
<span sid='42458' title='42458'>But I tell you now that if it is anything against the safety of the fort I will have no truck with it, so you can drive home your knife, and welcome."</span>
<p>
<span sid='42459' title='42459'>'"It is nothing against the fort," said he. </span>
<span sid='42460' title='42460'>"We only ask you to do that which your countrymen come to this land for. </span>
<span sid='42461' title='42461'>We ask you to be rich. </span>
<span sid='42462' title='42462'>If you will be one of us this night, we will swear to you upon the naked knife, and by the threefold oath, which no Sikh was ever known to break, that you shall have your fair share of the loot. </span>
<span sid='42463' title='42463'>A quarter of the treasure shall be yours. </span>
<span sid='42464' title='42464'>We can say no fairer."</span>
<p>
<span sid='42465' title='42465'>'"But what is the treasure, then?" I asked. </span>
<span sid='42466' title='42466'>"I am as ready to be rich as you can be, if you will but show me how it can be done."</span>
<p>
<span sid='42467' title='42467'>'"You will swear, then," said he, "by the bones of your father, by the honour of your mother, by the cross of your faith, to raise no hand and speak no word against us, either now or afterwards?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='42468' title='42468'>'"I will swear it," I answered, "provided that the fort is not endangered."</span>
<p>
<span sid='42469' title='42469'>'"Then, my comrade and I will swear that you shall have a quarter of the treasure, which shall be equally divided among the four of us."</span>
<p>
<span sid='42470' title='42470'>'"There are but three," said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42471' title='42471'>'"No; Dost Akbar must have his share. </span>
<span sid='42472' title='42472'>We can tell the tale to you while we await them. </span>
<span sid='42473' title='42473'>Do you stand at the gate, Mahomet Singh, and give notice of their coming. </span>
<span sid='42474' title='42474'>The thing stands thus, Sahib, and I tell it to you because I know that an oath is binding upon a Feringhee, and that we may trust you. </span>
<span sid='42475' title='42475'>Had you been a lying Hindoo, though you had sworn by all the gods in their false temples, your blood would have been upon the knife and your body in the water. </span>
<span sid='42476' title='42476'>But the Sikh knows the Englishman, and the Englishman knows the Sikh. </span>
<span sid='42477' title='42477'>Hearken, then, to what I have to say.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42478' title='42478'>'"There is a rajah in the northern provinces who has much wealth, though his lands are small. </span>
<span sid='42479' title='42479'>Much has come to him from his father, and more still he has set by himself, for he is of a low nature, and hoards his gold rather than spend it. </span>
<span sid='42480' title='42480'>When the troubles broke out he would be friends both with the lion and the tiger - with the Sepoy and with the Company's Raj. </span>
<span sid='42481' title='42481'>Soon, however, it seemed to him that the white men's day was come, for through all the land he could hear of nothing but of their death and their overthrow. </span>
<span sid='42482' title='42482'>Yet, being a careful man, he made such plans that, come what might, half at least of his treasure should be left to him. </span>
<span sid='42483' title='42483'>That which was in gold and silver he kept by him in the vaults of his palace; but the most precious stones and the choicest pearls that he had he put in an iron box, and sent it by a trusty servant, who, under the guise of a merchant, should take it to the fort at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Agra&t=h'>Agra</a>, there to lie until the land is at peace. </span>
<span sid='42484' title='42484'>Thus, if the rebels won he would have his money; but if the Company conquered, his jewels would be saved to him. </span>
<span sid='42485' title='42485'>Having thus divided his hoard, he threw himself into the cause of the Sepoys, since they were strong upon his borders. </span>
<span sid='42486' title='42486'>By his doing this, mark you, Sahib, his property becomes the due of those who have been true to their salt.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42487' title='42487'>'"This pretended merchant, who travels under the name of Achmet, is now in the city of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Agra&t=h'>Agra</a>, and desires to gain his way into the fort. </span>
<span sid='42488' title='42488'>He has with him as travelling-companion my foster-brother, Dost Akbar, who knows his secret. </span>
<span sid='42489' title='42489'>Dost Akbar has promised this night to lead him to a side-postern of the fort, and has chosen this one for his purpose. </span>
<span sid='42490' title='42490'>Here he will come presently and here he will find Mahomet Singh and myself awaiting him. </span>
<span sid='42491' title='42491'>The place is lonely, and none shall know of his coming. </span>
<span sid='42492' title='42492'>The world shall know of the merchant, Achmet, no more, but the great treasure of the rajah shall be divided among us. </span>
<span sid='42493' title='42493'>What say you to it, Sahib?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='42494' title='42494'>'In Worcestershire the life of a man seems a great and sacred thing; but it is very different when there is fire and blood all round you, and you have been used to meeting death at every turn. </span>
<span sid='42495' title='42495'>Whether Achmet, the merchant, lived or died was a thing as light as air to me, but at the talk about the treasure my heart turned to it, and I thought of what I might do in the old country with it, and how my folk would stare when they saw their ne'er-do-weel coming back with his pockets full of gold moidores. </span>
<span sid='42496' title='42496'>I had, therefore, already made up my mind. </span>
<span sid='42497' title='42497'>Abdullah Khan, however, thinking that I hesitated, pressed the matter more closely.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42498' title='42498'>'"Consider, Sahib," said he, "that if this man is taken by the commandant he will be hung or shot, and his jewels taken by the Government, so that no man will be a rupee the better for them. </span>
<span sid='42499' title='42499'>Now, since we do the taking of him, why should we not do the rest as well? </span>
<span sid='42500' title='42500'>The jewels will be as well with us as in the Company's coffers. </span>
<span sid='42501' title='42501'>There will be enough to make every one of us rich men and great chiefs. </span>
<span sid='42502' title='42502'>No one can know about the matter, for here we are cut off from all men. </span>
<span sid='42503' title='42503'>What could be better for the purpose? </span>
<span sid='42504' title='42504'>Say again, then, Sahib, whether you are with us, or if we must look upon you as an enemy."</span>
<p>
<span sid='42505' title='42505'>'"I am with you heart and soul," said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42506' title='42506'>'"It is well," he answered, handing me back my firelock. </span>
<span sid='42507' title='42507'>"You see that we trust you, for your word, like ours, is not to be broken. </span>
<span sid='42508' title='42508'>We have now only to wait for my brother and the merchant."</span>
<p>
<span sid='42509' title='42509'>'"Does your brother know, then, of what you will do?" I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42510' title='42510'>'"The plan is his. </span>
<span sid='42511' title='42511'>He has devised it. </span>
<span sid='42512' title='42512'>We will go to the gate and share the watch with Mahomet Singh."</span>
<p>
<span sid='42513' title='42513'>'The rain was still falling steadily, for it was just the beginning of the wet season. </span>
<span sid='42514' title='42514'>Brown, heavy clouds were drifting across the sky, and it was hard to see more than a stone-cast. </span>
<span sid='42515' title='42515'>A deep moat lay in front of our door, but the water was in places nearly dried up, and it could easily be crossed. </span>
<span sid='42516' title='42516'>It was strange to me to be standing there with those two wild Punjaubees waiting for the man who was coming to his death.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42517' title='42517'>'Suddenly my eve caught the glint of a shaded lantern at the other side of the moat. </span>
<span sid='42518' title='42518'>It vanished among the mound-heaps, and then appeared again coming slowly in our direction.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42519' title='42519'>'"Here they are!" I exclaimed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42520' title='42520'>'"You will challenge him, Sahib, as usual," whispered Abdullah. </span>
<span sid='42521' title='42521'>"Give him no cause for fear. </span>
<span sid='42522' title='42522'>Send us in with him, and we shall do the rest while you stay here on guard. </span>
<span sid='42523' title='42523'>Have the lantern ready to uncover, that we may be sure that it is indeed the man."</span>
<p>
<span sid='42524' title='42524'>'The light had flickered onwards, now stopping and now advancing, until I could see two dark figures upon the other side of the moat. </span>
<span sid='42525' title='42525'>I let them scramble down the sloping bank, splash through the mire, and climb half-way up to the gate, before I challenged them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42526' title='42526'>'"Who goes there?" said I, in a subdued voice.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42527' title='42527'>'"Friends," came the answer. </span>
<span sid='42528' title='42528'>I uncovered my lantern and threw a flood of light upon them. </span>
<span sid='42529' title='42529'>The first was an enormous Sikh, with a black beard which swept nearly down to his cummerbund. </span>
<span sid='42530' title='42530'>Outside of a show I have never seen so tall a man. </span>
<span sid='42531' title='42531'>The other was a little, fat, round fellow, with a great yellow turban, and a bundle in his hand, done up in a shawl. </span>
<span sid='42532' title='42532'>He seemed to be all in a quiver with fear, for his hands twitched as if he had the ague, and his head kept turning to left and right with two bright little twinkling eyes, like a mouse when he ventures out from his hole. </span>
<span sid='42533' title='42533'>It gave me the chills to think of killing him, but I thought of the treasure, and my heart set as hard as a flint within me. </span>
<span sid='42534' title='42534'>When he saw my white face he gave a little chirrup of joy, and came running up towards me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42535' title='42535'>'"Your protection, Sahib," he panted; "your protection for the unhappy merchant Achmet. </span>
<span sid='42536' title='42536'>I have travelled across Rajpootana that I might seek the shelter of the fort at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Agra&t=h'>Agra</a>. </span>
<span sid='42537' title='42537'>I have been robbed and beaten and abused because I have been the friend of the Company. </span>
<span sid='42538' title='42538'>It is a blessed night this when I am once more in safety - I and my poor possessions."</span>
<p>
<span sid='42539' title='42539'>'"What have you in the bundle?" I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42540' title='42540'>'"An iron box," he answered, "which contains one or two little family matters which are of no value to others, but which I should be sorry to lose. </span>
<span sid='42541' title='42541'>Yet I am not a beggar; and I shall reward you, young Sahib, and your governor also, if he will give me the shelter I ask."</span>
<p>
<span sid='42542' title='42542'>'I could not trust myself to speak longer with the man. </span>
<span sid='42543' title='42543'>The more I looked at his fat, frightened face, the harder did it seem that we should slay him in cold blood. </span>
<span sid='42544' title='42544'>It was best to get it over.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42545' title='42545'>'"Take him to the main guard," said I. </span>
<span sid='42546' title='42546'>The two Sikhs closed in upon him on each side, and the giant walked behind, while they marched in through the dark gateway. </span>
<span sid='42547' title='42547'>Never was a man so compassed round with death. </span>
<span sid='42548' title='42548'>I remained at the gateway with the lantern.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42549' title='42549'>'I could hear the measured tramp of their footsteps sounding through the lonely corridors. </span>
<span sid='42550' title='42550'>Suddenly it ceased, and I heard voices, and a scuffle, with the sound of blows. </span>
<span sid='42551' title='42551'>A moment later there came, to my horror, a rush of footsteps coming in my direction, with a loud breathing of a running man. </span>
<span sid='42552' title='42552'>I turned my lantern down the long, straight passage, and there was the fat man, running like the wind, with a smear of blood across his face, and close at his heels, bounding like a tiger, the great, black-bearded Sikh, with a knife flashing in his hand. </span>
<span sid='42553' title='42553'>I have never seen a man run so fast as that little merchant. </span>
<span sid='42554' title='42554'>He was gaining on the Sikh, and I could see that if he once passed me and got to the open air he would save himself yet. </span>
<span sid='42555' title='42555'>My heart softened to him, but again the thought of his treasure turned me hard and bitter. </span>
<span sid='42556' title='42556'>I cast my firelock between his legs as he raced past, and he rolled twice over like a shot rabbit. </span>
<span sid='42557' title='42557'>Ere he could stagger to his feet the Sikh was upon him, and buried his knife twice in his side. </span>
<span sid='42558' title='42558'>The man never uttered moan nor moved muscle, but lay where he had fallen. </span>
<span sid='42559' title='42559'>I think myself that he may have broken his neck with the fall. </span>
<span sid='42560' title='42560'>You see, gentlemen, that I am keeping my promise. </span>
<span sid='42561' title='42561'>I am telling you every word of the business just exactly as it happened, whether it is in my favour or not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42562' title='42562'>He stopped, and held out his manacled hands for the whisky-and-water which Holmes had brewed for him. </span>
<span sid='42563' title='42563'>For myself, I confess that I had now conceived the utmost horror of the man, not only for this coldblooded business in which he had been concerned, but even more for the somewhat flippant and careless way in which he narrated it. </span>
<span sid='42564' title='42564'>Whatever punishment was in store for him, I felt that he might expect no sympathy from me. </span>
<span sid='42565' title='42565'>Sherlock Holmes and Jones sat with their hands upon their knees, deeply interested in the story, but with the same disgust written upon their faces. </span>
<span sid='42566' title='42566'>He may have observed it, for there was a touch of defiance in his voice and manner as he proceeded.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42567' title='42567'>'It was all very bad, no doubt,' said he. </span>
<span sid='42568' title='42568'>'I should like to know how many fellows in my shoes would have refused a share of this loot when they knew that they would have their throats cut for their pains. </span>
<span sid='42569' title='42569'>Besides, it was my life or his when once he was in the fort. </span>
<span sid='42570' title='42570'>If he had got out, the whole business would come to light, and I should have been court-martialled and shot as likely as not; for people were not very lenient at a time like that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42571' title='42571'>'Go on with your story,' said Holmes, shortly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42572' title='42572'>'Well, we carried him in, Abdullah, Akbar and I. </span>
<span sid='42573' title='42573'>A fine weight he was, too, for all that he was so short. </span>
<span sid='42574' title='42574'>Mahomet Singh was left to guard the door. </span>
<span sid='42575' title='42575'>We took him to a place which the Sikhs had already prepared. </span>
<span sid='42576' title='42576'>It was some distance off, where a winding passage leads to a great empty hall, the brick walls of which were all crumbling to pieces. </span>
<span sid='42577' title='42577'>The earth floor had sunk in at one place, making a natural grave, so we left Achmet the merchant there, having first covered him over with loose bricks. </span>
<span sid='42578' title='42578'>This done, we all went back to the treasure.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42579' title='42579'>'It lay where he had dropped it when he was first attacked. </span>
<span sid='42580' title='42580'>The box was the same which now lies open upon your table. </span>
<span sid='42581' title='42581'>A key was hung by a silken cord to that carved handle upon the top. </span>
<span sid='42582' title='42582'>We opened it, and the light of the lantern gleamed upon a collection of gems such as I have read of and thought about when I was a little lad at Pershore. </span>
<span sid='42583' title='42583'>It was blinding to look upon them. </span>
<span sid='42584' title='42584'>When we had feasted our eyes we took them all out and made a list of them. </span>
<span sid='42585' title='42585'>There were one hundred and forty-three diamonds of the first water, including one which has been called, I believe, "the Great Mogul," and is said to be the second largest stone in existence. </span>
<span sid='42586' title='42586'>Then there were ninety-seven very fine emeralds, and one hundred and seventy rubies, some of which, however, were small. </span>
<span sid='42587' title='42587'>There were forty carbuncles, two hundred and ten sapphires, sixty-one agates, and a great quantity of beryls, onyxes, cats'-eyes, turquoises, and other stones, the very names of which I did not know at the time, though I have become more familiar with them since. </span>
<span sid='42588' title='42588'>Besides this, there were nearly three hundred very fine pearls, twelve of which were set in a gold coronet. </span>
<span sid='42589' title='42589'>By the way, these last had been taken out of the chest, and were not there when I recovered it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42590' title='42590'>'After we had counted our treasures we put them back into the chest and carried them to the gateway to show them to Mahomet Singh. </span>
<span sid='42591' title='42591'>Then we solemnly renewed our oath to stand by each other and be true to our secret. </span>
<span sid='42592' title='42592'>We agreed to conceal our loot in a safe place until the country should be at peace again, and then to divide it equally among ourselves. </span>
<span sid='42593' title='42593'>There was no use dividing it at present, for if gems of such value were found upon us it would cause suspicion, and there was no privacy in the fort nor any place where we could keep them. </span>
<span sid='42594' title='42594'>We carried the box, therefore, into the same hall where we had buried the body, and there, under certain bricks in the best-preserved wall, we made a hollow and put our treasure. </span>
<span sid='42595' title='42595'>We made careful note of the place, and next day I drew four plans, one for each of us, and put the sign of the four of us at the bottom, for we had sworn that we should each always act for all, so that none might take advantage. </span>
<span sid='42596' title='42596'>That is an oath that I can put my hand to my heart and swear that I have never broken.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42597' title='42597'>'Well, there's no use my telling you gentlemen what came of the Indian Mutiny. </span>
<span sid='42598' title='42598'>After Wilson took Delhi and Sir Colin relieved Lucknow the back of the business was broken. </span>
<span sid='42599' title='42599'>Fresh troops came pouring in, and Nana Sahib made himself scarce over the frontier. </span>
<span sid='42600' title='42600'>A flying column under Colonel Greathed came round to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Agra&t=h'>Agra</a> and cleared the Pandies away from it. </span>
<span sid='42601' title='42601'>Peace seemed to be settling upon the country, and we four were beginning to hope that the time was at hand when we might safely go off with our share of the plunder. </span>
<span sid='42602' title='42602'>In a moment, however, our hopes were shattered by our being arrested as the murderers of Achmet.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42603' title='42603'>'It came about in this way. </span>
<span sid='42604' title='42604'>When the rajah put his jewels into the hands of Achmet, he did it because he knew that he was a trusty man. </span>
<span sid='42605' title='42605'>They are suspicious folk in the East, however; so what does this rajah do but take a second even more trusty servant and set him to play the spy upon the first? </span>
<span sid='42606' title='42606'>The second man was ordered never to let Achmet out of his sight, and he followed him like his shadow. </span>
<span sid='42607' title='42607'>He went after him that night, and saw him pass through the doorway. </span>
<span sid='42608' title='42608'>Of course, he thought he had taken refuge in the fort, and applied for admission there himself next day, but could find no trace of Achmet. </span>
<span sid='42609' title='42609'>This seemed to him so strange that he spoke about it to a sergeant of guides, who brought it to the ears of the commandant. </span>
<span sid='42610' title='42610'>A thorough search was quickly made and the body was discovered. </span>
<span sid='42611' title='42611'>Thus at the very moment that we thought that all was safe we were all four seized and brought to trial on a charge of murder - three of us because we had held the gate that night, and the fourth because he was known to have been in the company of the murdered man. </span>
<span sid='42612' title='42612'>Not a word about the jewels came out at the trial, for the rajah had been deposed and driven out of India; so no one had any particular interest in them. </span>
<span sid='42613' title='42613'>The murder, however, was clearly made out, and it was certain that we must all have been concerned in it. </span>
<span sid='42614' title='42614'>The three Sikhs got penal servitude for life, and I was condemned to death, though my sentence was afterwards commuted into the same as the others.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42615' title='42615'>'It was rather a queer position that we found ourselves in then. </span>
<span sid='42616' title='42616'>There we were all four tied by the leg and with precious little chance of ever getting out again, while we each held a secret which might have put each of us in a palace if we could only have made use of it. </span>
<span sid='42617' title='42617'>It was enough to make a man eat his heart out to have to stand the kick and the cuff of every petty jack-in-office, to have rice to eat and water to drink, when that gorgeous fortune was ready for him outside, just waiting to be picked up. </span>
<span sid='42618' title='42618'>It might have driven me mad; but I was always a pretty stubborn one, so I just held on and bided my time.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42619' title='42619'>'At last it seemed to me to have come. </span>
<span sid='42620' title='42620'>I was changed from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Agra&t=h'>Agra</a> to Madras, and from there to Blair Island in the Andamans. </span>
<span sid='42621' title='42621'>There are very few white convicts at this settlement, and, as I had behaved well from the first, I soon found myself a sort of privileged person.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42622' title='42622'>I was given a hut in Hope Town, which is a small place, on the slopes of Mount Harriet, and I was left pretty much to myself. </span>
<span sid='42623' title='42623'>It is a dreary, fever-stricken place, and all beyond our little clearings was infested with wild cannibal natives, who were ready enough to blow a poisoned dart at us if they saw a chance. </span>
<span sid='42624' title='42624'>There was digging and ditching and yam-planting, and a dozen other things to be done, so we were busy enough all day; though in the evening we had a little time to ourselves. </span>
<span sid='42625' title='42625'>Among other things, I learned to dispense drugs for the surgeon, and picked up a smattering of his knowledge. </span>
<span sid='42626' title='42626'>All the time I was on the took-out for a chance of escape; but it is hundreds of miles from any other land, and there is little or no wind in those seas: so it was a terribly difficult job to get away.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42627' title='42627'>'The surgeon, Dr. Somerton, was a fast, sporting young chap, and the other young officers would meet in his rooms of an evening and play cards. </span>
<span sid='42628' title='42628'>The surgery, where I used to make up my drugs, was next to his sitting-room, with a small window between us. </span>
<span sid='42629' title='42629'>Often, if I felt lonesome, I used to turn out the lamp in the surgery, and then, standing there, I could hear their talk and watch their play. </span>
<span sid='42630' title='42630'>I am fond of a hand at cards myself, and it was almost as good as having one to watch the others. </span>
<span sid='42631' title='42631'>There was Major Sholto, Captain Morstan, and Lieutenant Bromley Brown, who were in command of the native troops, and there was the surgeon himself, and two or three prison-officials, crafty old hands who played a nice, sly, safe game. </span>
<span sid='42632' title='42632'>A very snug little party they used to make.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42633' title='42633'>'Well, there was one thing which very soon struck me, and that was that the soldiers used always to lose and the civilians to win. </span>
<span sid='42634' title='42634'>Mind, I don't say there was anything unfair, but so it was. </span>
<span sid='42635' title='42635'>These prison-chaps had done little else than play cards ever since they had been at the Andamans, and they knew each other's game to a point, while the others just played to pass the time and threw their cards down anyhow. </span>
<span sid='42636' title='42636'>Night after night the soldiers got up poorer men, and the poorer they got the more keen they were to play. </span>
<span sid='42637' title='42637'>Major Sholto was the hardest hit. </span>
<span sid='42638' title='42638'>He used to pay in notes and gold at first, but soon it came to notes of hand and for big sums. </span>
<span sid='42639' title='42639'>He sometimes would win for a few deals, just to give him heart, and then the luck would set in against him worse than ever. </span>
<span sid='42640' title='42640'>All day he would wander about as black as thunder, and he took to drinking a deal more than was good for him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42641' title='42641'>'One night he lost even more heavily than usual. </span>
<span sid='42642' title='42642'>I was sitting in my hut when he and Captain Morstan came stumbling along on the way to their quarters. </span>
<span sid='42643' title='42643'>They were bosom friends, those two, and never far apart. </span>
<span sid='42644' title='42644'>The Major was raving about his losses.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42645' title='42645'>'"It's all up, Morstan," he was saying, as they passed my hut. </span>
<span sid='42646' title='42646'>"I shall have to send in my papers. </span>
<span sid='42647' title='42647'>I am a ruined man."</span>
<p>
<span sid='42648' title='42648'>'"Nonsense, old chap!" said the other, slapping him upon the shoulder. </span>
<span sid='42649' title='42649'>"I've had a nasty facer myself, but-" That was all I could hear, but it was enough to set me thinking.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42650' title='42650'>'A couple of days later Major Sholto was strolling on the beach: so I took the chance of speaking to him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42651' title='42651'>'"I wish to have your advice, Major," said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42652' title='42652'>'"Well, Small, what is it?" he asked, taking his cheroot from his lips.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42653' title='42653'>'"I wanted to ask you, sir," said I, "who is the proper person to whom hidden treasure should be handed over. </span>
<span sid='42654' title='42654'>I know where half a million worth lies, and, as I cannot use it myself, I thought perhaps the best thing that I could do would be to hand it over to the proper authorities, and then perhaps they would get my sentence shortened for me."</span>
<p>
<span sid='42655' title='42655'>'"Half a million, Small?" he gasped, looking hard at me to see if I was in earnest.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42656' title='42656'>'"Quite that, sir - in jewels and pearls. </span>
<span sid='42657' title='42657'>It lies there ready for anyone. </span>
<span sid='42658' title='42658'>And the queer thing about it is that the real owner is outlawed and cannot hold property, so that it belongs to the first comer."</span>
<p>
<span sid='42659' title='42659'>'"To Government, Small," he stammered, "to Government." </span>
<span sid='42660' title='42660'>But he said it in a halting fashion, and I knew in my heart that I had got him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42661' title='42661'>'"You think, then, sir, that I should give the information to the Governor-General?" said I, quietly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42662' title='42662'>'"Well, well, you must not do anything rash, or that you might repent. </span>
<span sid='42663' title='42663'>Let me hear all about it, Small. </span>
<span sid='42664' title='42664'>Give me the facts."</span>
<p>
<span sid='42665' title='42665'>'I told him the whole story, with small changes, so that he could not identify the places. </span>
<span sid='42666' title='42666'>When I had finished he stood stock-still and full of thought. </span>
<span sid='42667' title='42667'>I could see by the twitch of his lip that there was a struggle going on within him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42668' title='42668'>'"This is a very important matter, Small," he said at last. </span>
<span sid='42669' title='42669'>"You must not say a word to anyone about it, and I shall see you again soon."</span>
<p>
<span sid='42670' title='42670'>'Two nights later he and his friend, Captain Morstan, came to my hut in the dead of the night with a lantern.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42671' title='42671'>'"I want you just to let Captain Morstan hear that story from your own lips, Small," said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42672' title='42672'>'I repeated it as I had told it before.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42673' title='42673'>'"It rings true, eh?" said he. </span>
<span sid='42674' title='42674'>"It's good enough to act upon?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='42675' title='42675'>'Captain Morstan nodded.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42676' title='42676'>'"Look here, Small," said the Major. </span>
<span sid='42677' title='42677'>"We have been talking it over, my friend here and I, and we have come to the conclusion that this secret of yours is hardly a Government matter, after all, but is a private concern of your own, which, of course, you have the power of disposing of as you think best. </span>
<span sid='42678' title='42678'>Now the question is: What price would you ask for it? </span>
<span sid='42679' title='42679'>We might be inclined to take it up, and at least look into it, if we could agree as to terms." </span>
<span sid='42680' title='42680'>He tried to speak in a cool, careless way, but his eyes. </span>
<span sid='42681' title='42681'>were shining with excitement and greed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42682' title='42682'>'"Why, as to that, gentlemen," I answered, trying also to be cool, but feeling as excited as he did, "there is only one bargain which a man in my position can make, I shall want you to help me to my freedom, and to help my three companions to theirs. </span>
<span sid='42683' title='42683'>We shall then take you into partnership, and give you a fifth share to divide between you."</span>
<p>
<span sid='42684' title='42684'>'"Hum!" said he. </span>
<span sid='42685' title='42685'>"A fifth share! </span>
<span sid='42686' title='42686'>That it not very tempting."</span>
<p>
<span sid='42687' title='42687'>'"It would come to fifty thousand apiece," said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42688' title='42688'>'"But how can we gain your freedom? </span>
<span sid='42689' title='42689'>You know very well that you ask an impossibility."</span>
<p>
<span sid='42690' title='42690'>'"Nothing of the sort," I answered. </span>
<span sid='42691' title='42691'>"I have thought it all out to the last detail. </span>
<span sid='42692' title='42692'>The only bar to our escape is that we can get no boat fit for the voyage, and no provisions to last us for so long a time. </span>
<span sid='42693' title='42693'>There are plenty of little yachts and yawls at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Calcutta&t=h'>Calcutta</a> or Madras which would serve our turn well. </span>
<span sid='42694' title='42694'>Do you bring one over. </span>
<span sid='42695' title='42695'>We shall engage to get aboard her by night, and if you will drop us on any part of the Indian coast you will have done your part of the bargain."</span>
<p>
<span sid='42696' title='42696'>'"If there were only one," he said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42697' title='42697'>'"None or all," I answered. </span>
<span sid='42698' title='42698'>"We have sworn it. </span>
<span sid='42699' title='42699'>The four of us must always act together."</span>
<p>
<span sid='42700' title='42700'>'"You see, Morstan," said he, "Small is a man of his word. </span>
<span sid='42701' title='42701'>He does not flinch from his friends. </span>
<span sid='42702' title='42702'>I think we may very well trust him."</span>
<p>
<span sid='42703' title='42703'>'"It's a dirty business," the other answered. </span>
<span sid='42704' title='42704'>"Yet, as you say, the money will save our commissions handsomely."</span>
<p>
<span sid='42705' title='42705'>'"Well, Small," said the Major, "we must, I suppose, try and meet you. </span>
<span sid='42706' title='42706'>We must first, of course, test the truth of your story. </span>
<span sid='42707' title='42707'>Tell me where the box is hid, and I shall get leave of absence and go back to India in the monthly relief-boat to inquire into the affair."</span>
<p>
<span sid='42708' title='42708'>'"Not so fast," said I, growing colder as he got hot. </span>
<span sid='42709' title='42709'>"I must have the consent of my three comrades. </span>
<span sid='42710' title='42710'>I tell you that it is four or none with us."</span>
<p>
<span sid='42711' title='42711'>'"Nonsense!" he broke in. </span>
<span sid='42712' title='42712'>"What have three black fellows to do with our agreement?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='42713' title='42713'>'"Black or blue," said I, "they are in with me, and we all go together."</span>
<p>
<span sid='42714' title='42714'>'Well, the matter ended by a second meeting, at which Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan, and Dost Akbar were all present. </span>
<span sid='42715' title='42715'>We talked the matter over again, and at last we came to an arrangement. </span>
<span sid='42716' title='42716'>We were to provide both the officers with charts of the part of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Agra&t=h'>Agra</a> fort, and mark the place in the wall where the treasure was hid. </span>
<span sid='42717' title='42717'>Major Sholto was to go to India to test our story. </span>
<span sid='42718' title='42718'>If he found the box he was to leave it there, to send out a small yacht provisioned for a voyage, which was to lie off Rutland Island, and to which we were to make our way, and finally to return to his duties. </span>
<span sid='42719' title='42719'>Captain Morstan was then to apply for leave of absence, to meet us at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Agra&t=h'>Agra</a>, and there we were to have a final division of the treasure, he taking the Major's share as well as his own. </span>
<span sid='42720' title='42720'>All this we sealed by the most solemn oaths that the mind could think or the lips utter. </span>
<span sid='42721' title='42721'>I sat up all night with paper and ink, and by the morning I had the two charts all ready, signed with the sign of four-that is, of Abdullah, Akbar, Mahomet, and myself.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42722' title='42722'>'Well, gentlemen, I weary you with my long story, and I know that my friend Mr. Jones is impatient to get me safely stowed in chokey. </span>
<span sid='42723' title='42723'>I'll make it as short as I can. </span>
<span sid='42724' title='42724'>The villain Sholto went off to India, but he never came back again. </span>
<span sid='42725' title='42725'>Captain Morstan showed me his name among a list of passengers in one of the mailboats very shortly afterwards. </span>
<span sid='42726' title='42726'>His uncle had died, leaving him a fortune, and he had left the army; yet he could stoop to treat five men as he had treated us. </span>
<span sid='42727' title='42727'>Morstan went over to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Agra&t=h'>Agra</a> shortly afterwards, and found, as we expected, that the treasure was indeed gone. </span>
<span sid='42728' title='42728'>The scoundrel had stolen it all, without carrying out one of the conditions on which we had sold him the secret. </span>
<span sid='42729' title='42729'>From that day I lived only for vengeance. </span>
<span sid='42730' title='42730'>I thought of it by day and I nursed it by night. </span>
<span sid='42731' title='42731'>It became an overpowering, absorbing passion with me. </span>
<span sid='42732' title='42732'>I cared nothing for the law - nothing for the gallows. </span>
<span sid='42733' title='42733'>To escape, to track down Sholto, to have my hand upon his throat - that was my one thought. </span>
<span sid='42734' title='42734'>Even the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Agra&t=h'>Agra</a> treasure had come to be a smaller thing in my mind than the slaving of Sholto.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42735' title='42735'>'Well, I have set my mind on many things in this life, and never one which I did not carry out. </span>
<span sid='42736' title='42736'>But it was weary years before my time came. </span>
<span sid='42737' title='42737'>I have told you that I had picked up something of medicine. </span>
<span sid='42738' title='42738'>One day when Dr. Somerton was down with a fever a little Andaman Islander was picked up by a convict-gang in the woods. </span>
<span sid='42739' title='42739'>He was sick to death, and had gone to a lonely place to die. </span>
<span sid='42740' title='42740'>I took him in hand, though he was as venomous as a young snake, and after a couple of months I got him all right and able to walk. </span>
<span sid='42741' title='42741'>He took a kind of fancy to me then, and would hardly go back to his woods, but was always hanging about my hut. </span>
<span sid='42742' title='42742'>I learned a little of his lingo from him, and this made him all the fonder of me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42743' title='42743'>'Tonga - for that was his name - was a fine boatman, and owned a big, roomy canoe of his own. </span>
<span sid='42744' title='42744'>When I found that he was devoted to me and would do anything to serve me, I saw my chance of escape. </span>
<span sid='42745' title='42745'>I talked it over with him. </span>
<span sid='42746' title='42746'>He was to bring his boat round on a certain night to an old wharf which was never guarded, and there he was to pick me up. </span>
<span sid='42747' title='42747'>I gave him directions to have several gourds of water and a lot of yams, coco-nuts, and sweet potatoes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42748' title='42748'>'He was stanch and true, was little Tonga. </span>
<span sid='42749' title='42749'>No man ever had a more faithful mate. </span>
<span sid='42750' title='42750'>On the night named he had his boat at the wharf. </span>
<span sid='42751' title='42751'>As it chanced, however, there was one of the convict-guard down there - a vile Pathan who had never missed a chance of insulting and injuring me. </span>
<span sid='42752' title='42752'>I had always vowed vengeance, and now I had my chance. </span>
<span sid='42753' title='42753'>It was as if fate had placed him in my way that I might pay my debt before I left the island. </span>
<span sid='42754' title='42754'>He stood on the bank with his back to me, and his carbine on his shoulder. </span>
<span sid='42755' title='42755'>I looked about for a stone to beat out his brains with, but none could I see.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42756' title='42756'>'Then a queer thought came into my head, and showed me where I could lay my hand on a weapon. </span>
<span sid='42757' title='42757'>I sat down in the darkness and unstrapped my wooden leg. </span>
<span sid='42758' title='42758'>With three long hops I was on him. </span>
<span sid='42759' title='42759'>He put his carbine to his shoulder, but I struck him full, and knocked the whole front of his skull in. </span>
<span sid='42760' title='42760'>You can see the split in the wood now where I hit him. </span>
<span sid='42761' title='42761'>We both went down together, for I could not keep my balance; but when I got up I found him lying quiet enough. </span>
<span sid='42762' title='42762'>I made for the boat, and in an hour we were well out at sea. </span>
<span sid='42763' title='42763'>Tonga had brought all his earthly possessions with him, his arms and his gods. </span>
<span sid='42764' title='42764'>Among other things, he had a long bamboo spear, and some Andaman coco-nut matting, with which I made a sort of a sail. </span>
<span sid='42765' title='42765'>For ten days we were beating about, trusting to luck, and on the eleventh we were picked up by a trader which was going from Singapore to Jiddah with a cargo of Malay pilgrims. </span>
<span sid='42766' title='42766'>They were a rum crowd, and Tonga and I soon managed to settle down among them. </span>
<span sid='42767' title='42767'>They had one very good quality: they let you alone and asked no questions.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42768' title='42768'>'Well, if I were to tell you all the adventures that my little chum and I went through, you would not thank me, for I would have you here until the sun was shining. </span>
<span sid='42769' title='42769'>Here and there we drifted about the world, something always turning up to keep us from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='42770' title='42770'>All the time, however, I never lost sight of my purpose. </span>
<span sid='42771' title='42771'>I would dream of Sholto at night. </span>
<span sid='42772' title='42772'>A hundred times I have killed him in my sleep. </span>
<span sid='42773' title='42773'>At last, however, some three or four years ago, we found ourselves in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>. </span>
<span sid='42774' title='42774'>I had no great difficulty in finding where Sholto lived, and I set to work to discover whether he had realized the treasure, or if he still had it. </span>
<span sid='42775' title='42775'>I made friends with someone who could help me - I name no names, for I don't want to get anyone else in a hole-and I soon found that he still had the jewels. </span>
<span sid='42776' title='42776'>Then I tried to get at him in many ways; but he was pretty sly, and had always two prize-fighters, besides his sons and his khitmutgar on guard over him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42777' title='42777'>'One day, however, I got word that he was dying. </span>
<span sid='42778' title='42778'>I hurried at once to the garden, mad that he should slip out of my clutches like that, and, looking through the window, I saw him lying in his bed, with his sons on each side of him. </span>
<span sid='42779' title='42779'>I'd have come through and taken my chance with the three of them, only even as I looked at him his jaw dropped, and I knew that he was gone. </span>
<span sid='42780' title='42780'>I got into his room the same night, though, and I searched his papers to see if there was any record of where he had hidden our jewels. </span>
<span sid='42781' title='42781'>There was not a line, however, so I came away, bitter and savage as a man could be. </span>
<span sid='42782' title='42782'>Before I left I bethought me that if I ever met my Sikh friends again it would be a satisfaction to know that I had left some mark of our hatred; so I scrawled down the sign of the four of us, as it had been on the chart, and I pinned it on his bosom. </span>
<span sid='42783' title='42783'>It was too much that he should be taken to the grave without some token from the men whom he had robbed and befooled.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42784' title='42784'>'We earned a living at this time by my exhibiting poor Tonga at fairs and other such places as the black cannibal. </span>
<span sid='42785' title='42785'>He would eat raw meat and dance his wardance: so we always had a hatful of pennies after a day's work. </span>
<span sid='42786' title='42786'>I still heard all the news from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pondicherry&t=h'>Pondicherry</a> Lodge, and for some years there was no news to hear, except that they were hunting for the treasure. </span>
<span sid='42787' title='42787'>At last, however, came what we had waited for so long. </span>
<span sid='42788' title='42788'>The treasure had been found. </span>
<span sid='42789' title='42789'>It was up at the top of the house, in Mr. Bartholomew Sholto's chemical laboratory. </span>
<span sid='42790' title='42790'>I came at once and had a look at the place, but I could not see how, with my wooden leg, I was to make my way up to it. </span>
<span sid='42791' title='42791'>I learned, however, about a trap-door in the roof, and also about Mr. Sholto's supper-hour. </span>
<span sid='42792' title='42792'>It seemed to me that I could manage the thing easily through Tonga. </span>
<span sid='42793' title='42793'>I brought him out with me with a long rope wound round his waist. </span>
<span sid='42794' title='42794'>He could climb like a cat, and he soon made his way through the roof, but, as ill-luck would have it, Bartholomew Sholto was still in the room, to his cost. </span>
<span sid='42795' title='42795'>Tonga thought he had done something very clever in killing him, for when I came up by the rope I found him strutting about as proud as a peacock. </span>
<span sid='42796' title='42796'>Very much surprised was he when I made at him with the rope's end and cursed him for a little, bloodthirsty imp. </span>
<span sid='42797' title='42797'>I took the treasure box and let it down, and then slid down myself, having first left the sign of the four upon the table, to show that the jewels had come back at last to those who had most right to them. </span>
<span sid='42798' title='42798'>Tonga then pulled up the rope, closed the window, and made off the way that he had come.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42799' title='42799'>'I don't know that I have anything else to tell you. </span>
<span sid='42800' title='42800'>I had heard a waterman speak of the speed of Smith's launch, the Aurora, so I thought she would be a handy craft for our escape. </span>
<span sid='42801' title='42801'>I engaged with old Smith, and was to give him a big sum if he got us safe to our ship. </span>
<span sid='42802' title='42802'>He knew, no doubt, that there was some screw loose, but he was not in our secrets. </span>
<span sid='42803' title='42803'>All this is the truth, and if I tell it to you, gentlemen, it is not to amuse you - for you have not done me a very good turn - but it is because I believe the best defence I can make is just to hold back nothing, but let all the world know how badly I have myself been served by Major Sholto, and how innocent I am of the death of his son.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42804' title='42804'>'A very remarkable account,' said Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='42805' title='42805'>'A fitting wind-up to an extremely interesting case. </span>
<span sid='42806' title='42806'>There is nothing at all new to me in the latter part of your narrative, except that you brought your own rope. </span>
<span sid='42807' title='42807'>That I did not know. </span>
<span sid='42808' title='42808'>By the way, I had hoped that Tonga had lost all his darts; yet he managed to shoot one at us in the boat.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42809' title='42809'>'He had lost them all, sir, except the one which was in his blow-pipe at the time.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42810' title='42810'>'Ah, of course,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='42811' title='42811'>'I had not thought of that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42812' title='42812'>'Is there any other point which you would like to ask about?' asked the convict, affably.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42813' title='42813'>'I think not, thank you,' my companion answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42814' title='42814'>'Well, Holmes,' said Athelney Jones, 'you are a man to be humoured, and we all know that you are a connoisseur of crime; but duty is duty, and I have gone rather far in doing what you and your friend asked me. </span>
<span sid='42815' title='42815'>I shall feel more at case when we have our storyteller here safe under lock and key. </span>
<span sid='42816' title='42816'>The cab still waits, and there are two inspectors downstairs. </span>
<span sid='42817' title='42817'>I am much obliged to you both for your assistance. </span>
<span sid='42818' title='42818'>Of course, you will be wanted at the trial. </span>
<span sid='42819' title='42819'>Good night to you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42820' title='42820'>'Good night, gentlemen both,' said Jonathan Small.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42821' title='42821'>'You first, Small,' remarked the wary Jones as they left the room. </span>
<span sid='42822' title='42822'>'I'll take particular care that you don't club me with your wooden leg, whatever you may have done to the gentleman at the Andaman Isles.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42823' title='42823'>'Well, and there is the end of our little drama,' I remarked, after we had sat some time smoking in silence. </span>
<span sid='42824' title='42824'>'I fear that it may be the last investigation in which I shall have the chance of studying your methods. </span>
<span sid='42825' title='42825'>Miss Morstan has done me the honour to accept me as a husband in prospective.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42826' title='42826'>He gave a most dismal groan.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42827' title='42827'>'I feared as much,' said he. </span>
<span sid='42828' title='42828'>'I really cannot congratulate you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42829' title='42829'>I was a little hurt.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42830' title='42830'>'Have you any reason to be dissatisfied with my choice?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42831' title='42831'>'Not at all. </span>
<span sid='42832' title='42832'>I think she is one of the most charming young ladies I ever met, and might have been most useful in such work as we have been doing. </span>
<span sid='42833' title='42833'>She had a decided genius that way; witness the way in which she preserved that <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Agra&t=h'>Agra</a> plan from all the other papers of her father. </span>
<span sid='42834' title='42834'>But love is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional is opposed to that true, cold reason which I place above all things. </span>
<span sid='42835' title='42835'>I should never marry myself, lest I bias my judgment.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42836' title='42836'>'I trust,' said I, laughing, 'that my judgment may survive the ordeal. </span>
<span sid='42837' title='42837'>But you look weary.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42838' title='42838'>'Yes, the reaction is already upon me. </span>
<span sid='42839' title='42839'>I shall be as limp as a rag for a week.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42840' title='42840'>'Strange,' said I, 'how terms of what in another man I should call laziness alternate with your fits of splendid energy and vigour.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42841' title='42841'>'Yes,' he answered, 'there are in me the makings of a very fine loafer, and also of a pretty spry sort of a fellow. </span>
<span sid='42842' title='42842'>I often think of those lines of old Goethe:-</span>
<p>
<span sid='42843' title='42843'>Schade class die Natur nur einen Mensch aus dir schuf, Denn zum würdigen Mann war und zum Schelmen der Stoff.</span>
<p>
<span sid='42844' title='42844'>By the way, apropos of this <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a> business, you see that they had, as I surmised, a confederate in the house, who could be none other than Lal Rao, the butler: so Jones actually has the undivided honour of having caught one fish in his great haul.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42845' title='42845'>'The division seems rather unfair,' I remarked. </span>
<span sid='42846' title='42846'>'You have done all the work in this business. </span>
<span sid='42847' title='42847'>I get a wife out of it, Jones gets the credit; pray what remains for you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='42848' title='42848'>'For me,' said Sherlock Holmes, 'there still remains the cocaine-bottle.' </span>
<span sid='42849' title='42849'>And he stretched his long, white hand up for it.</span>
