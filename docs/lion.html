<p class="subtitle">Arthur Conan Doyle<label for="sn-meta-lion" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-meta-lion" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><!--googleoff: all--><b>Story Number</b>: 57<br><b>Published in</b>: The Liberty magazine, 27 November 1926 (US)<br><b>Collected in</b>: The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes<!--googleon: all--></span></p>
<p>
<span sid='17962' title='17962'>It is a most singular thing that a problem which was certainly as abstruse and unusual as any which I have faced in my long professional career should have come to me after my retirement, and be brought, as it were, to my very door. </span>
<span sid='17963' title='17963'>It occurred after my withdrawal to my little <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sussex&t=h'>Sussex</a> home, when I had given myself up entirely to that soothing life of Nature for which I had so often yearned during the long years spent amid the gloom of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='17964' title='17964'>At this period of my life the good Watson had passed almost beyond my ken. </span>
<span sid='17965' title='17965'>An occasional week-end visit was the most I ever saw of him. </span>
<span sid='17966' title='17966'>Thus I must act as my own chronicler. </span>
<span sid='17967' title='17967'>Ah! had he but been with me, how much he might have made of so wonderful a happening and of my eventual triumph against every difficulty! </span>
<span sid='17968' title='17968'>As it is, however, I must needs tell my tale in my own plain way, showing by my words each step upon the difficult road which lay before me as I searched for the mystery of the Lion's Mane.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17969' title='17969'>My villa is situated upon the southern slope of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Downs&t=h'>the Downs</a>, commanding a great view of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Channel&t=h'>the Channel</a>. </span>
<span sid='17970' title='17970'>At this point the coast line is entirely of chalk cliffs, which can only be descended by a single, long, tortuous path, which is steep and slippery. </span>
<span sid='17971' title='17971'>At the bottom of the path lie a hundred yards of pebbles and shingle, even when the tide is at full. </span>
<span sid='17972' title='17972'>Here and there, however, there are curves and hollows which make splendid swimming pools filled afresh with each flow. </span>
<span sid='17973' title='17973'>This admirable beach extends for some miles in each direction, save only at one point where the little cove and village of Fulworth break the line.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17974' title='17974'>My house is lonely. </span>
<span sid='17975' title='17975'>I, my old housekeeper, and my bees have the estate all to ourselves. </span>
<span sid='17976' title='17976'>Half a mile off, however, is Harold Stackhurst's well-known coaching establishment, The Gables - quite a large place, which contains some score of young fellows preparing for various professions, with a staff of several masters. </span>
<span sid='17977' title='17977'>Stackhurst himself was a wellknown rowing Blue in his day, and an excellent all-round scholar. </span>
<span sid='17978' title='17978'>He and I were always friendly from the day I came to the coast, and he was the one man who was on such terms with me that we could drop in on each other in the evenings without an invitation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17979' title='17979'>Towards the end of July 1907, there was a severe gale, the wind blowing up-Channel, heaping the seas to the base of the cliffs, and leaving a lagoon at the turn of the tide. </span>
<span sid='17980' title='17980'>On the morning of which I speak the wind had abated, and all Nature was newly washed and fresh. </span>
<span sid='17981' title='17981'>It was impossible to work upon so delightful a day, and I strolled out before breakfast to enjoy the exquisite air. </span>
<span sid='17982' title='17982'>I walked along the cliff path which led to the steep descent to the beach. </span>
<span sid='17983' title='17983'>As I walked I heard a shout behind me, and there was Harold Stackhurst waving his hand in cheery greeting.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17984' title='17984'>'What a morning, Mr Holmes! </span>
<span sid='17985' title='17985'>I thought I should see you out.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17986' title='17986'>'Going for a swim, I see.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17987' title='17987'>'At your old tricks again,' he laughed, patting his bulging pocket. </span>
<span sid='17988' title='17988'>'Yes, McPherson started early, and I expect I may find him there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='17989' title='17989'>Fitzroy McPherson was the science master, a fine upstanding young fellow whose life had been crippled by heart trouble following rheumatic fever. </span>
<span sid='17990' title='17990'>He was a natural athlete, however, and excelled in every game which did not throw too great a strain upon him. </span>
<span sid='17991' title='17991'>Summer and winter he went for his swim, and, as I am a swimmer myself, I have often joined him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='17992' title='17992'>At this moment we saw the man himself. </span>
<span sid='17993' title='17993'>His head showed above the edge of the cliff where the path ends. </span>
<span sid='17994' title='17994'>Then his whole figure appeared at the top, staggering like a drunken man. </span>
<span sid='17995' title='17995'>The next instant he threw up his hands, and, with a terrible cry, fell upon his face. </span>
<span sid='17996' title='17996'>Stackhurst and I rushed forward - it may have been fifty yards - and turned him on his back. </span>
<span sid='17997' title='17997'>He was obviously dying. </span>
<span sid='17998' title='17998'>Those glazed sunken eyes and dreadful livid cheeks could mean nothing else. </span>
<span sid='17999' title='17999'>One glimmer of life came into his face for an instant, and he uttered two or three words with an eager air of warning. </span>
<span sid='18000' title='18000'>They were slurred and indistinct, but to my ear the last of them, which burst in a shriek from his lips, were 'the lion's mane'. </span>
<span sid='18001' title='18001'>It was utterly irrelevant and unintelligible, and yet I could twist the sound into no other sense. </span>
<span sid='18002' title='18002'>Then he half raised himself from the ground, threw his arms into the air and fell forward on his side. </span>
<span sid='18003' title='18003'>He was dead.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18004' title='18004'>My companion was paralysed by the sudden horror of it, but I, as may well be imagined, had every sense on the alert. </span>
<span sid='18005' title='18005'>And I had need, for it was speedily evident that we were in the presence of an extraordinary case. </span>
<span sid='18006' title='18006'>The man was dressed only in his Burberry overcoat, his trousers, and an unlaced pair of canvas shoes. </span>
<span sid='18007' title='18007'>As he fell over, his Burberry, which had been simply thrown round his shoulders, slipped off, exposing his trunk. </span>
<span sid='18008' title='18008'>We stared at it in amazement. </span>
<span sid='18009' title='18009'>His back was covered with dark red lines as though he had been terribly flogged by a thin wire scourge. </span>
<span sid='18010' title='18010'>The instrument with which this punishment had been inflicted was clearly flexible, for the long, angry weals curved round his shoulders and ribs. </span>
<span sid='18011' title='18011'>There was blood dripping down his chin, for he had bitten through his lower lip in the paroxysm of his agony. </span>
<span sid='18012' title='18012'>His drawn and distorted face told how terrible that agony had been.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18013' title='18013'>I was kneeling and Stackhurst standing by the body when a shadow fell across us, and we found that Ian Murdoch was by our side. </span>
<span sid='18014' title='18014'>Murdoch was the mathematical coach at the establishment, a tall, dark, thin man, so taciturn and aloof that none can be said to have been his friend. </span>
<span sid='18015' title='18015'>He seemed to live in some high abstract region of surds and conic sections with little to connect him with ordinary life. </span>
<span sid='18016' title='18016'>He was looked upon as an oddity by the students, and would have been their butt, but there was some strange outlandish blood in the man which showed itself not only in his coal-black eyes and swarthy face, but also in occasional outbreaks of temper, which could only be described as ferocious. </span>
<span sid='18017' title='18017'>On one occasion, being plagued by a little dog belonging to McPherson, he had caught the creature up and hurled it through the plate-glass window - an action for which Stackhurst would certainly have given him his dismissal had he not been a very valuable teacher. </span>
<span sid='18018' title='18018'>Such was the strange, complex man who now appeared beside us. </span>
<span sid='18019' title='18019'>He seemed to be honestly shocked at the sight before him, though the incident of the dog may show that there was no great sympathy between the dead man and himself.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18020' title='18020'>'Poor fellow! </span>
<span sid='18021' title='18021'>Poor fellow! </span>
<span sid='18022' title='18022'>What can I do? </span>
<span sid='18023' title='18023'>How can I help?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18024' title='18024'>'Were you with him? </span>
<span sid='18025' title='18025'>Can you tell us what has happened?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18026' title='18026'>'No, no, I was late this morning. </span>
<span sid='18027' title='18027'>I was not on the beach at all. </span>
<span sid='18028' title='18028'>I have come straight from The Gables. </span>
<span sid='18029' title='18029'>What can I do?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18030' title='18030'>'You can hurry to the police station at Fulworth. </span>
<span sid='18031' title='18031'>Report the matter at once.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18032' title='18032'>Without a word he made off at top speed, and I proceeded to take the matter in hand, while Stackhurst, dazed at this tragedy, remained by the body. </span>
<span sid='18033' title='18033'>My first task naturally was to note who was on the beach. </span>
<span sid='18034' title='18034'>From the top of the path I could see the whole sweep of it, and it was absolutely deserted save that two or three dark figures could be seen far away moving towards the village of Fulworth. </span>
<span sid='18035' title='18035'>Having satisfied myself upon this point, I walked slowly down the path. </span>
<span sid='18036' title='18036'>There was clay or soft marl mixed with the chalk, and every here and there I saw the same footstep, both ascending and descending. </span>
<span sid='18037' title='18037'>No one else had gone down to the beach by this track that morning. </span>
<span sid='18038' title='18038'>At one place I observed the print of an open hand with the fingers towards the incline. </span>
<span sid='18039' title='18039'>This could only mean that poor McPherson had fallen as he ascended. </span>
<span sid='18040' title='18040'>There were rounded depressions, too, which suggested that he had come down upon his knees more than once. </span>
<span sid='18041' title='18041'>At the bottom of the path was the considerable lagoon left by the retreating tide. </span>
<span sid='18042' title='18042'>At the side of it McPherson had undressed, for there lay his towel on a rock. </span>
<span sid='18043' title='18043'>It was folded and dry, so that it would seem that after all he had never entered the water. </span>
<span sid='18044' title='18044'>Once or twice as I hunted round amid the hard shingle I came on little patches of sand where the print of his canvas shoe, and also of his naked foot, could be seen. </span>
<span sid='18045' title='18045'>The latter fact proved that he had made all ready to bathe, though the towel indicated that he had not actually done so.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18046' title='18046'>And here was the problem clearly defined - as strange a one as had ever confronted me. </span>
<span sid='18047' title='18047'>The man had not been on the beach more than a quarter of an hour at the most. </span>
<span sid='18048' title='18048'>Stackhurst had followed him from The Gables, so there could be no doubt about that. </span>
<span sid='18049' title='18049'>He had gone to bathe and had stripped, as the naked footsteps showed. </span>
<span sid='18050' title='18050'>Then he had suddenly huddled on his clothes again - they were all dishevelled and unfastened - and he had returned without bathing, or at any rate without drying himself. </span>
<span sid='18051' title='18051'>And the reason for his change of purpose had been that he had been scourged in some savage, inhuman fashion, tortured until he bit his lip through in his agony, and was left with only strength enough to crawl away and to die. </span>
<span sid='18052' title='18052'>Who had done this barbarous deed? </span>
<span sid='18053' title='18053'>There were, it is true, small grottoes and caves in the base of the cliffs, but the low sun shone directly into them, and there was no place for concealment. </span>
<span sid='18054' title='18054'>Then, again, there were those distant figures on the beach. </span>
<span sid='18055' title='18055'>They seemed too far away to have been connected with the crime, and the broad lagoon in which McPherson had intended to bathe lay between him and them, lapping up to the rocks. </span>
<span sid='18056' title='18056'>On the sea two or three fishing boats were at no great distance. </span>
<span sid='18057' title='18057'>Their occupants might be examined at our leisure. </span>
<span sid='18058' title='18058'>There were several roads for inquiry, but none which led to any very obvious goal.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18059' title='18059'>When I at last returned to the body I found that a little group of wandering folk had gathered round it. </span>
<span sid='18060' title='18060'>Stackhurst was, of course, still there, and Ian Murdoch had just arrived with Anderson, the village constable, a big, gingermoustached man of the slow solid <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sussex&t=h'>Sussex</a> breed - a breed which covers much good sense under a heavy, silent exterior. </span>
<span sid='18061' title='18061'>He listened to everything, took note of all we said, and finally drew me aside.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18062' title='18062'>'I'd be glad of your advice, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='18063' title='18063'>This is a big thing for me to handle, and I'll hear of it from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lewes&t=h'>Lewes</a> if I go wrong.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18064' title='18064'>I advised him to send for his immediate superior, and for a doctor, also to allow nothing to be removed, and as few fresh footmarks as possible to be made, until they came. </span>
<span sid='18065' title='18065'>In the mean time I searched the dead man's pockets. </span>
<span sid='18066' title='18066'>There were his handkerchief, a large knife, and a small folding card-case. </span>
<span sid='18067' title='18067'>From this projected a slip of paper, which I unfolded and handed to the constable. </span>
<span sid='18068' title='18068'>There was written on it in a scrawling feminine hand: </span>
<span sid='18069' title='18069'>'I will be there you may be sure. </span>
<span sid='18070' title='18070'>Maudie.' </span>
<span sid='18071' title='18071'>It read like a love affair, an assignation, though when and where were a blank. </span>
<span sid='18072' title='18072'>The constable replaced it in the card-case and returned it with the other things to the pockets of the Burberry. </span>
<span sid='18073' title='18073'>Then, as nothing more suggested itself, I walked back to my house for breakfast, having first arranged that the base of the cliffs should be thoroughly searched.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18074' title='18074'>Stackhurst was round in an hour or two to tell me that the body had been removed to The Gables, where the inquest would be held. </span>
<span sid='18075' title='18075'>He brought with him some serious and definite news. </span>
<span sid='18076' title='18076'>As I expected, nothing had been found in the small caves below the cliff, but he had examined the papers in McPherson's desk, and there were several which showed an intimate correspondence with a certain Miss Maud Bellamy, of Fulworth. </span>
<span sid='18077' title='18077'>We had then established the identity of the writer of the note.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18078' title='18078'>'The police have the letters,' he explained. </span>
<span sid='18079' title='18079'>'I could not bring them. </span>
<span sid='18080' title='18080'>But there is no doubt that it was a serious love affair. </span>
<span sid='18081' title='18081'>I see no reason, however, to connect it with that horrible happening save, indeed, that the lady had made an appointment with him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18082' title='18082'>'But hardly at a bathing-pool which all of you were in the habit of using,' I remarked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18083' title='18083'>'It is mere chance', said he, 'that several of the students were not with McPherson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18084' title='18084'>'Was it mere chance?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18085' title='18085'>Stackhurst knit his brows in thought.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18086' title='18086'>'Ian Murdoch held them back,' said he, 'he would insist upon some algebraic demonstration before breakfast. </span>
<span sid='18087' title='18087'>Poor chap, he is dreadfully cut up about it all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18088' title='18088'>'And yet I gather that they were not friends.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18089' title='18089'>'At one time they were not. </span>
<span sid='18090' title='18090'>But for a year or more Murdoch has been as near to McPherson as he ever could be to anyone. </span>
<span sid='18091' title='18091'>He is not of a very sympathetic disposition by nature.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18092' title='18092'>'So I understand. </span>
<span sid='18093' title='18093'>I seem to remember your telling me once about a quarrel over the ill-usage of a dog.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18094' title='18094'>'That blew over all right.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18095' title='18095'>'But left some vindictive feeling, perhaps.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18096' title='18096'>'No, no, I am sure they were real friends.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18097' title='18097'>'Well, then, we must explore the matter of the girl. </span>
<span sid='18098' title='18098'>Do you know her?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18099' title='18099'>'Everybody knows her. </span>
<span sid='18100' title='18100'>She is the beauty of the neighbourhood - a real beauty, Holmes, who would draw attention everywhere. </span>
<span sid='18101' title='18101'>I knew that McPherson was attracted by her, but I had no notion that it had gone so far as these letters would seem to indicate.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18102' title='18102'>'But who is she?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18103' title='18103'>'She is the daughter of old Tom Bellamy, who owns all the boats and bathing-cots at Fulworth. </span>
<span sid='18104' title='18104'>He was a fisherman to start with, but is now a man of some substance. </span>
<span sid='18105' title='18105'>He and his son William run the business.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18106' title='18106'>'Shall we walk into Fulworth and see them?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18107' title='18107'>'On what pretext?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18108' title='18108'>'Oh, we can easily find a pretext. </span>
<span sid='18109' title='18109'>After all, this poor man did not ill-use himself in this outrageous way. </span>
<span sid='18110' title='18110'>Some human hand was on the handle of that scourge, if indeed it was a scourge which inflicted the injuries. </span>
<span sid='18111' title='18111'>His circle of acquaintances in this lonely place was surely limited. </span>
<span sid='18112' title='18112'>Let us follow it up in every direction and we can hardly fail to come upon the motive, which in turn should lead us to the criminal.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18113' title='18113'>It would have been a pleasant walk across the thymescented downs had our minds not been poisoned by the tragedy we had witnessed. </span>
<span sid='18114' title='18114'>The village of Fulworth lies in a hollow curving in a semicircle round the bay. </span>
<span sid='18115' title='18115'>Behind the old-fashioned hamlet several modern houses have been built upon the rising ground. </span>
<span sid='18116' title='18116'>It was to one of these that Stackhurst guided me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18117' title='18117'>'That's The Haven, as Bellamy called it. </span>
<span sid='18118' title='18118'>The one with the corner tower and slate roof. </span>
<span sid='18119' title='18119'>Not bad for a man who started with nothing but - By Jove, look at that!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18120' title='18120'>The garden gate of The Haven had opened and a man had emerged. </span>
<span sid='18121' title='18121'>There was no mistaking that tall, angular, straggling figure. </span>
<span sid='18122' title='18122'>It was Ian Murdoch, the mathematician. </span>
<span sid='18123' title='18123'>A moment later we confronted him upon the road.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18124' title='18124'>'Hullo!' said Stackhurst. </span>
<span sid='18125' title='18125'>The man nodded, gave us a sideways glance from his curious dark eyes, and would have passed us, but his principal pulled him up.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18126' title='18126'>'What were you doing there?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18127' title='18127'>Murdoch's face flushed with anger. </span>
<span sid='18128' title='18128'>'I am your subordinate, sir, under your roof. </span>
<span sid='18129' title='18129'>I am not aware that I owe you any account of my private actions.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18130' title='18130'>Stackhurst's nerves were near the surface after all he had endured. </span>
<span sid='18131' title='18131'>Otherwise, perhaps, he would have waited. </span>
<span sid='18132' title='18132'>Now he lost his temper completely.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18133' title='18133'>'In the circumstances your answer is pure impertinence, Mr Murdoch.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18134' title='18134'>'Your own question might perhaps come under the same heading.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18135' title='18135'>'This is not the first time that I have had to overlook your insubordinate ways. </span>
<span sid='18136' title='18136'>It will certainly be the last. </span>
<span sid='18137' title='18137'>You will kindly make fresh arrangements for your future as speedily as you can.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18138' title='18138'>'I had intended to do so. </span>
<span sid='18139' title='18139'>I have lost to-day the only person who made The Gables habitable.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18140' title='18140'>He strode off upon his way, while Stackhurst, with angry eyes, stood glaring after him. </span>
<span sid='18141' title='18141'>'Is he not an impossible, intolerable man?' he cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18142' title='18142'>The one thing that impressed itself forcibly upon my mind was that Mr Ian Murdoch was taking the first chance to open a path of escape from the scene of the crime. </span>
<span sid='18143' title='18143'>Suspicion, vague and nebulous, was now beginning to take outline in my mind. </span>
<span sid='18144' title='18144'>Perhaps the visit to the Bellamys might throw some further light upon the matter. </span>
<span sid='18145' title='18145'>Stackhurst pulled himself together and we went forward to the house.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18146' title='18146'>Mr Bellamy proved to be a middle-aged man with a flaming red beard. </span>
<span sid='18147' title='18147'>He seemed to be in a very angry mood, and his face was soon as florid as his hair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18148' title='18148'>'No, sir, I do not desire any particulars. </span>
<span sid='18149' title='18149'>My son here' - indicating a powerful young man, with a heavy, sullen face, in the corner of the sitting-room - 'is of one mind with me that Mr McPherson's attentions to Maud were insulting. </span>
<span sid='18150' title='18150'>Yes, sir, the word "marriage" was never mentioned, and yet there were letters and meetings, and a great deal more of which neither of us could approve. </span>
<span sid='18151' title='18151'>She has no mother, and we are her only guardians. </span>
<span sid='18152' title='18152'>We are determined-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18153' title='18153'>But the words were taken from his mouth by the appearance of the lady herself. </span>
<span sid='18154' title='18154'>There was no gainsaying that she would have graced any assembly in the world. </span>
<span sid='18155' title='18155'>Who could have imagined that so rare a flower would grow from such a root and in such an atmosphere? </span>
<span sid='18156' title='18156'>Women have seldom been an attraction to me, for my brain has always governed my heart, but I could not look upon her perfect clear-cut face, with all the soft freshness of the Downlands in her delicate colouring, without realizing that no young man would cross her path unscathed. </span>
<span sid='18157' title='18157'>Such was the girl who had pushed open the door and stood now, wide-eyed and intense, in front of Harold Stackhurst.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18158' title='18158'>'I know already that Fitzroy is dead,' she said. </span>
<span sid='18159' title='18159'>'Do not be afraid to tell me the particulars.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18160' title='18160'>'This other gentleman of yours let us know the news,' explained the father.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18161' title='18161'>'There is no reason why my sister should be brought into the matter,' growled the younger man.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18162' title='18162'>The sister turned a sharp, fierce look upon him. </span>
<span sid='18163' title='18163'>'This is my business, William. </span>
<span sid='18164' title='18164'>Kindly leave me to manage it in my own way. </span>
<span sid='18165' title='18165'>By all accounts there has been a crime committed. </span>
<span sid='18166' title='18166'>If I can help to show who did it, it is the least I can do for him who is gone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18167' title='18167'>She listened to a short account from my companion, with a composed concentration which showed me that she possessed strong character as well as great beauty. </span>
<span sid='18168' title='18168'>Maud Bellamy will always remain in my memory as a most complete and remarkable woman. </span>
<span sid='18169' title='18169'>It seems that she already knew me by sight, for she turned to me at the end.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18170' title='18170'>'Bring them to justice, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='18171' title='18171'>You have my sympathy and my help, whoever they may be.' </span>
<span sid='18172' title='18172'>It seemed to me that she glanced defiantly at her father and brother as she spoke.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18173' title='18173'>'Thank you,' said I. </span>
<span sid='18174' title='18174'>'I value a woman's instinct in such matters. </span>
<span sid='18175' title='18175'>You use the word "they". </span>
<span sid='18176' title='18176'>You think that more than one person was concerned?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18177' title='18177'>'I knew Mr McPherson well enough to be aware that he was a brave and a strong man. </span>
<span sid='18178' title='18178'>No single person could ever have inflicted such an outrage upon him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18179' title='18179'>'Might I have one word with you alone?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18180' title='18180'>'I tell you, Maud, not to mix yourself up in the matter,' cried her father angrily.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18181' title='18181'>She looked at me helplessly. </span>
<span sid='18182' title='18182'>'What can I do?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18183' title='18183'>'The whole world will know the facts presently, so there can be no harm if I discuss them here,' said I. </span>
<span sid='18184' title='18184'>'I should have preferred privacy, but if your father will not allow it, he must share the deliberations.' </span>
<span sid='18185' title='18185'>Then I spoke of the note which had been found in the dead man's pocket. </span>
<span sid='18186' title='18186'>'It is sure to be produced at the inquest. </span>
<span sid='18187' title='18187'>May I ask you to throw any light upon it that you can?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18188' title='18188'>'I see no reason for mystery,' she answered. </span>
<span sid='18189' title='18189'>'We were engaged to be married, and we only kept it secret because Fitzroy's uncle, who is very old and said to be dying, might have disinherited him if he had married against his wish. </span>
<span sid='18190' title='18190'>There was no other reason.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18191' title='18191'>'You could have told us,' growled Mr Bellamy.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18192' title='18192'>'So I would, father, if you had ever shown sympathy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18193' title='18193'>'I object to my girl picking up with men outside her own station.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18194' title='18194'>'It was your prejudice against him which prevented us from telling you. </span>
<span sid='18195' title='18195'>As to this appointment' - she fumbled in her dress and produced a crumpled note - 'it was in answer to this.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18196' title='18196'>Dearest, [ran the message]</span>
<p>
<span sid='18197' title='18197'>The old place on the beach just after sunset on Tuesday. </span>
<span sid='18198' title='18198'>It is the only time I can get away. </span>
<span sid='18199' title='18199'>- F.M.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18200' title='18200'>'Tuesday was to-day, and I had meant to meet him tonight.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18201' title='18201'>I turned over the paper. </span>
<span sid='18202' title='18202'>'This never came by post. </span>
<span sid='18203' title='18203'>How did you get it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18204' title='18204'>'I would rather not answer that question. </span>
<span sid='18205' title='18205'>It has really nothing to do with the matter which you are investigating. </span>
<span sid='18206' title='18206'>But anything which bears upon that I will most freely answer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18207' title='18207'>She was as good as her word, but there was nothing which was helpful in our investigation. </span>
<span sid='18208' title='18208'>She had no reason to think that her fiancÃ© had any hidden enemy, but she admitted that she had had several warm admirers.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18209' title='18209'>'May I ask if Mr Ian Murdoch was one of them?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18210' title='18210'>She blushed and seemed confused.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18211' title='18211'>'There was a time when I thought he was. </span>
<span sid='18212' title='18212'>But that was all changed when he understood the relations between Fitzroy and myself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18213' title='18213'>Again the shadow round this strange man seemed to me to be taking more definite shape. </span>
<span sid='18214' title='18214'>His record must be examined. </span>
<span sid='18215' title='18215'>His rooms must be privately searched. </span>
<span sid='18216' title='18216'>Stackhurst was a willing collaborator, for in his mind also suspicions were forming. </span>
<span sid='18217' title='18217'>We returned from our visit to The Haven with the hope that one free end of this tangled skein was already in our hands.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18218' title='18218'>A week passed. </span>
<span sid='18219' title='18219'>The inquest had thrown no light upon the matter and had been adjourned for further evidence. </span>
<span sid='18220' title='18220'>Stackhurst had made discreet inquiry about his subordinate, and there had been a superficial search of his room, but without result. </span>
<span sid='18221' title='18221'>Personally, I had gone over the whole ground again, both physically and mentally, but with no new conclusions. </span>
<span sid='18222' title='18222'>In all my chronicles the reader will find no case which brought me so completely to the limit of my powers. </span>
<span sid='18223' title='18223'>Even my imagination could conceive no solution to the mystery. </span>
<span sid='18224' title='18224'>And then there came the incident of the dog.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18225' title='18225'>It was my old housekeeper who heard of it first by that strange wireless by which such people collect the news of the countryside.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18226' title='18226'>'Sad story this, sir, about Mr McPherson's dog,' said she one evening.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18227' title='18227'>I do not encourage such conversations, but the words arrested my attention.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18228' title='18228'>'What of Mr McPherson's dog?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18229' title='18229'>'Dead, sir. </span>
<span sid='18230' title='18230'>Died of grief for its master.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18231' title='18231'>'Who told you this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18232' title='18232'>'Why, sir, everyone is talking of it. </span>
<span sid='18233' title='18233'>It took on terrible, and has eaten nothing for a week. </span>
<span sid='18234' title='18234'>Then to-day two of the young gentlemen from The Gables found it dead - down on the beach, sir, at the very place where its master met his end.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18235' title='18235'>'At the very place.' </span>
<span sid='18236' title='18236'>The words stood out clear in my memory. </span>
<span sid='18237' title='18237'>Some dim perception that the matter was vital rose in my mind. </span>
<span sid='18238' title='18238'>That the dog should die was after the beautiful, faithful nature of dogs. </span>
<span sid='18239' title='18239'>But 'in the very place'! </span>
<span sid='18240' title='18240'>Why should this lonely beach be fatal to it? </span>
<span sid='18241' title='18241'>Was it possible that it also, had been sacrificed to some revengeful feud? </span>
<span sid='18242' title='18242'>Was it possible - Yes, the perception was dim, but already something was building up in my mind. </span>
<span sid='18243' title='18243'>In a few minutes I was on my way to The Gables, where I found Stackhurst in his study. </span>
<span sid='18244' title='18244'>At my request he sent for Sudbury and Blount, the two students who had found the dog.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18245' title='18245'>'Yes, it lay on the very edge of the pool,' said one of them. </span>
<span sid='18246' title='18246'>'It must have followed the trail of its dead master.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18247' title='18247'>I saw the faithful little creature, an Airedale terrier, laid out upon the mat in the hall. </span>
<span sid='18248' title='18248'>The body was stiff and rigid, the eyes projecting, and the limbs contorted. </span>
<span sid='18249' title='18249'>There was agony in every line of it. </span>
<span sid='18250' title='18250'>From The Gables I walked down to the bathing pool. </span>
<span sid='18251' title='18251'>The sun had sunk and the shadow of the great cliff lay black across the water, which glimmered dully like a sheet of lead. </span>
<span sid='18252' title='18252'>The place was deserted and there was no sign of life save for two sea-birds circling and screaming overhead. </span>
<span sid='18253' title='18253'>In the fading light I could dimly make out the little dog's spoor upon the sand round the very rock on which his master's towel had been laid. </span>
<span sid='18254' title='18254'>For a long time I stood in deep meditation while the shadows grew darker around me. </span>
<span sid='18255' title='18255'>My mind was filled with racing thoughts. </span>
<span sid='18256' title='18256'>You have known what it was to be in a nightmare in which you feel that there is some all-important thing for which you search and which you know is there, though it remains for ever just beyond your reach. </span>
<span sid='18257' title='18257'>That was how I felt that evening as I stood alone by that place of death. </span>
<span sid='18258' title='18258'>Then at last I turned and walked slowly homewards.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18259' title='18259'>I had just reached the top of the path when it came to me. </span>
<span sid='18260' title='18260'>Like a flash, I remembered the thing for which I had so eagerly and vainly grasped. </span>
<span sid='18261' title='18261'>You will know, or Watson has written in vain, that I hold a vast store of out-of-the-way knowledge, without scientific system, but very available for the needs of my work. </span>
<span sid='18262' title='18262'>My mind is like a crowded boxroom with packets of all sorts stowed away therein - so many that I may well have but a vague perception of what was there. </span>
<span sid='18263' title='18263'>I had known that there was something which might bear upon this matter. </span>
<span sid='18264' title='18264'>It was still vague, but at least I knew how I could make it clear. </span>
<span sid='18265' title='18265'>It was monstrous, incredible, and yet it was always a possibility. </span>
<span sid='18266' title='18266'>I would test it to the full.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18267' title='18267'>There is a great garret in my little house which is stuffed with books. </span>
<span sid='18268' title='18268'>It was into this that I plunged and rummaged for an hour. </span>
<span sid='18269' title='18269'>At the end of that time I emerged with a little chocolate and silver volume. </span>
<span sid='18270' title='18270'>Eagerly I turned up the chapter of which I had a dim remembrance. </span>
<span sid='18271' title='18271'>Yes, it was indeed a far-fetched and unlikely proposition, and yet I could not be at rest until I had made sure if it might, indeed, be so. </span>
<span sid='18272' title='18272'>It was late when I retired, with my mind eagerly awaiting the work of the morrow.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18273' title='18273'>But that work met with an annoying interruption. </span>
<span sid='18274' title='18274'>I had hardly swallowed my early cup of tea and was starting for the beach when I had a call from Inspector Bardle of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sussex&t=h'>Sussex</a> Constabulary - a steady, solid, bovine man with thoughtful eyes, which looked at me now with a very troubled expression.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18275' title='18275'>'I know your immense experience sir,' said he. </span>
<span sid='18276' title='18276'>'This is quite unofficial, of course, and need go no farther. </span>
<span sid='18277' title='18277'>But I am fairly up against it in this McPherson case. </span>
<span sid='18278' title='18278'>The question is, shall I make an arrest, or shall I not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18279' title='18279'>'Meaning Mr Ian Murdoch?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18280' title='18280'>'Yes, sir. </span>
<span sid='18281' title='18281'>There is really no one else when you come to think of it. </span>
<span sid='18282' title='18282'>That's the advantage of this solitude. </span>
<span sid='18283' title='18283'>We narrow it down to a very small compass. </span>
<span sid='18284' title='18284'>If he did not do it, then who did?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18285' title='18285'>'What have you against him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18286' title='18286'>He had gleaned along the same furrows as I had. </span>
<span sid='18287' title='18287'>There was Murdoch's character and the mystery which seemed to hang round the man. </span>
<span sid='18288' title='18288'>His furious bursts of temper, as shown in the incident of the dog. </span>
<span sid='18289' title='18289'>The fact that he had quarrelled with McPherson in the past, and that there was some reason to think that he might have resented his attentions to Miss Bellamy. </span>
<span sid='18290' title='18290'>He had all my points, but no fresh ones, save that Murdoch seemed to be making every preparation for departure.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18291' title='18291'>'What would my position be if I let him slip away with all this evidence against him?' </span>
<span sid='18292' title='18292'>The burly, phlegmatic man was sorely troubled in his mind.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18293' title='18293'>'Consider', I said, 'all the essential gaps in your case. </span>
<span sid='18294' title='18294'>On the morning of the crime he can surely prove an alibi. </span>
<span sid='18295' title='18295'>He had been with his scholars till the last moment, and within a few minutes of McPherson's appearance he came upon us from behind. </span>
<span sid='18296' title='18296'>Then bear in mind the absolute impossibility that he could single-handed have inflicted this outrage upon a man quite as strong as himself. </span>
<span sid='18297' title='18297'>Finally there is the question of the instrument with which these injuries were inflicted.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18298' title='18298'>'What could it be but a scourge or flexible whip of some sort?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18299' title='18299'>'Have you examined the marks?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18300' title='18300'>'I have seen them. </span>
<span sid='18301' title='18301'>So has the doctor.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18302' title='18302'>'But I have examined them very carefully with a lens. </span>
<span sid='18303' title='18303'>They have peculiarities.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18304' title='18304'>'What are they, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18305' title='18305'>I stepped to my bureau and brought out an enlarged photograph. </span>
<span sid='18306' title='18306'>'This is my method in such cases,' I explained.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18307' title='18307'>'You certainly do things thoroughly, Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18308' title='18308'>'I should hardly be what I am if I did not. </span>
<span sid='18309' title='18309'>Now let us consider this weal which extends round the right shoulder. </span>
<span sid='18310' title='18310'>Do you observe nothing remarkable?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18311' title='18311'>'I can't say I do.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18312' title='18312'>'Surely it is evident that it is unequal in its intensity. </span>
<span sid='18313' title='18313'>There is a dot of extravasated blood here, and another there. </span>
<span sid='18314' title='18314'>There are similar indications in this other weal down here. </span>
<span sid='18315' title='18315'>What can that mean?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18316' title='18316'>'I have no idea. </span>
<span sid='18317' title='18317'>Have you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18318' title='18318'>'Perhaps I have. </span>
<span sid='18319' title='18319'>Perhaps I haven't. </span>
<span sid='18320' title='18320'>I may be able to say more soon. </span>
<span sid='18321' title='18321'>Anything which will define what made that mark will bring us a long way towards the criminal.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18322' title='18322'>'It is, of course, an absurd idea,' said the policeman, 'but if a red-hot net of wire had been laid across the back, then these better-marked points would represent where the meshes crossed each other.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18323' title='18323'>'A most ingenious comparison. </span>
<span sid='18324' title='18324'>Or shall we say a very stiff cat-o'-nine-tails with small hard knots upon it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18325' title='18325'>'By jove, Mr Holmes, I think you have hit it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18326' title='18326'>'Or there may be some very different cause, Mr Bardle. </span>
<span sid='18327' title='18327'>But you case is far too weak for an arrest. </span>
<span sid='18328' title='18328'>Besides, we have those last words - "Lion's Mane".'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18329' title='18329'>'I have wondered whether Ian-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18330' title='18330'>'Yes, I have considered that. </span>
<span sid='18331' title='18331'>If the second word had any resemblance to Murdoch - but it did not. </span>
<span sid='18332' title='18332'>He gave it almost in a shriek. </span>
<span sid='18333' title='18333'>I am sure that it was "Mane".'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18334' title='18334'>'Have you no alternative, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18335' title='18335'>'Perhaps I have. </span>
<span sid='18336' title='18336'>But I do not care to discuss it until there is something solid to discuss.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18337' title='18337'>'And when will that be?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18338' title='18338'>'In an hour - possibly less.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18339' title='18339'>The Inspector rubbed his chin and looked at me with dubious eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18340' title='18340'>'I wish I could see what was in your mind, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='18341' title='18341'>Perhaps it's those fishing-boats.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18342' title='18342'>'No, no, they were too far out.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18343' title='18343'>'Well, then, is it Bellamy and that big son of his? </span>
<span sid='18344' title='18344'>They were not too sweet upon Mr McPherson. </span>
<span sid='18345' title='18345'>Could they have done him a mischief?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18346' title='18346'>'No, no, you won't draw me until I am ready,' said I with a smile. </span>
<span sid='18347' title='18347'>'Now, Inspector, we each have our own work to do. </span>
<span sid='18348' title='18348'>Perhaps if you were to meet me here at midday-?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18349' title='18349'>So far we had got when there came the tremendous interruption which was the beginning of the end.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18350' title='18350'>My outer door was flung open, there were blundering footsteps in the passage, and Ian Murdoch staggered into the room, pallid, dishevelled, his clothes in wild disorder, clawing with his bony hands at the furniture to hold himself erect. </span>
<span sid='18351' title='18351'>'Brandy! </span>
<span sid='18352' title='18352'>Brandy!' he gasped, and fell groaning upon the sofa.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18353' title='18353'>He was not alone. </span>
<span sid='18354' title='18354'>Behind him came Stackhurst, hatless and panting, almost as distrait as his companion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18355' title='18355'>'Yes, yes, brandy!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='18356' title='18356'>'The man is at his last gasp. </span>
<span sid='18357' title='18357'>It was all I could do to bring him here. </span>
<span sid='18358' title='18358'>He fainted twice upon the way.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18359' title='18359'>Half a tumbler of the raw spirit brought about a wondrous change. </span>
<span sid='18360' title='18360'>He pushed himself up on one arm and swung his coat off his shoulders. </span>
<span sid='18361' title='18361'>'For God's sake! oil, opium, morphia!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='18362' title='18362'>'Anything to ease this infernal agony!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18363' title='18363'>The Inspector and I cried out at the sight. </span>
<span sid='18364' title='18364'>There, criss-crossed upon the man's naked shoulder, was the same strange reticulated pattern of red, inflamed lines which had been the death-mark of Fitzroy McPherson.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18365' title='18365'>The pain was evidently terrible and was more than local, for the sufferer's breathing would stop for a time, his face would turn black, and then with loud gasps he would clap his hand to his heart, while his brow dropped beads of sweat. </span>
<span sid='18366' title='18366'>At any moment he might die. </span>
<span sid='18367' title='18367'>More and more brandy was poured down his throat, each fresh dose bringing him back to life. </span>
<span sid='18368' title='18368'>Pads of cotton wool soaked in salad oil seemed to take the agony from the strange wounds. </span>
<span sid='18369' title='18369'>At last his head fell heavily upon the cushion. </span>
<span sid='18370' title='18370'>Exhausted Nature had taken refuge in its last storehouse of vitality. </span>
<span sid='18371' title='18371'>It was half a sleep and half a faint, but at least it was ease from pain.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18372' title='18372'>To question him had been impossible, but the moment we were assured of his condition Stackhurst turned upon me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18373' title='18373'>'My God!' he cried, 'what is it, Holmes? </span>
<span sid='18374' title='18374'>What is it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18375' title='18375'>'Where did you find him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18376' title='18376'>'Down on the beach. </span>
<span sid='18377' title='18377'>Exactly where poor McPherson met his end. </span>
<span sid='18378' title='18378'>If this man's heart had been weak as McPherson's was, he would not be here now. </span>
<span sid='18379' title='18379'>More than once I thought he was gone as I brought him up. </span>
<span sid='18380' title='18380'>It was too far to The Gables, so I made for you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18381' title='18381'>'Did you see him on the beach?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18382' title='18382'>'I was walking on the cliff when I heard his cry. </span>
<span sid='18383' title='18383'>He was at the edge of the water, reeling about like a drunken man. </span>
<span sid='18384' title='18384'>I ran down, threw some clothes over him and brought him up. </span>
<span sid='18385' title='18385'>For heaven's sake, Holmes, use all the powers you have and spare no pains to lift the curse from this place, for life is becoming unendurable. </span>
<span sid='18386' title='18386'>Can you, with all your worldwide reputation, do nothing for us?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18387' title='18387'>'I think I can, Stackhurst. </span>
<span sid='18388' title='18388'>Come with me now! </span>
<span sid='18389' title='18389'>And you, Inspector, come along! </span>
<span sid='18390' title='18390'>We will see if we cannot deliver this murderer into your hands.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18391' title='18391'>Leaving the unconscious man in the charge of my housekeeper, we all three went down to the deadly lagoon. </span>
<span sid='18392' title='18392'>On the shingle there was piled a little heap of towels and clothes, left by the stricken man. </span>
<span sid='18393' title='18393'>Slowly I walked round the edge of the water, my comrades in Indian file behind me. </span>
<span sid='18394' title='18394'>Most of the pool was quite shallow, but under the cliff where the beach was hollowed out it was four or five feet deep. </span>
<span sid='18395' title='18395'>It was to this part that a swimmer would naturally go, for it formed a beautiful pellucid green pool as clear as crystal. </span>
<span sid='18396' title='18396'>A line of rocks lay above it at the base of the cliff, and along this I led the way, peering eagerly into the depths beneath me. </span>
<span sid='18397' title='18397'>I had reached the deepest and stillest pool when my eyes caught that for which they were searching, and I burst into a shout of triumph.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18398' title='18398'>'Cyanea!' I cried.'Cyanea! </span>
<span sid='18399' title='18399'>Behold the Lion's Mane!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18400' title='18400'>The strange object at which I pointed did indeed look like a tangled mass torn from the mane of a lion. </span>
<span sid='18401' title='18401'>It lay upon a rocky shelf some three feet under the water, a curious waving, vibrating, hairy creature with streaks of silver among its yellow tresses. </span>
<span sid='18402' title='18402'>It pulsated with a slow, heavy dilation and contraction.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18403' title='18403'>'It has done mischief enough. </span>
<span sid='18404' title='18404'>Its day is over!' I cried. </span>
<span sid='18405' title='18405'>'Help me, Stackhurst! </span>
<span sid='18406' title='18406'>Let us end the murderer for ever.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18407' title='18407'>There was a big boulder just above the ledge, and we pushed it until it fell with a tremendous splash into the water. </span>
<span sid='18408' title='18408'>When the ripples had cleared we saw that it had settled upon the ledge below. </span>
<span sid='18409' title='18409'>One flapping edge of yellow membrane showed that our victim was beneath it. </span>
<span sid='18410' title='18410'>A thick oily scum oozed out from below the stone and stained the water round, rising slowly to the surface.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18411' title='18411'>'Well, this gets me!' cried the Inspector. </span>
<span sid='18412' title='18412'>'What was it, Mr Holmes? </span>
<span sid='18413' title='18413'>I'm born and bred in these parts, but I never saw such a thing. </span>
<span sid='18414' title='18414'>It don't belong to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sussex&t=h'>Sussex</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18415' title='18415'>'Just as well for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sussex&t=h'>Sussex</a>,' I remarked. </span>
<span sid='18416' title='18416'>'It may have been the South-west gale that brought it up. </span>
<span sid='18417' title='18417'>Come back to my house, both of you, and I will give you the terrible experience of one who had good reason to remember his own meeting with the same peril of the seas.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18418' title='18418'>When we reached my study, we found that Murdoch was so far recovered that he could sit up. </span>
<span sid='18419' title='18419'>He was dazed in mind, and every now and then was shaken by a paroxysm of pain. </span>
<span sid='18420' title='18420'>In broken words he explained that he had no notion what had occurred to him, save that terrific pangs had suddenly shot through him, and that it had taken all his fortitude to reach the bank.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18421' title='18421'>'Here is a book,' I said, taking up the little volume, 'which first brought light into what might have been for ever dark. </span>
<span sid='18422' title='18422'>It is Out of Doors, by the famous observer J. G. Wood. </span>
<span sid='18423' title='18423'>Wood himself very nearly perished from contact with this vile creature, so he wrote with a very full knowledge. </span>
<span sid='18424' title='18424'>Cyanea capillata is the miscreant's full name, and he can be as dangerous to life as, and far more painful than, the bite of the cobra. </span>
<span sid='18425' title='18425'>Let me briefly give this extract.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18426' title='18426'>'"If the bather should see a loose roundish mass of tawny membranes and fibres, something like very large handfuls of lion's mane and silver paper, let him beware, for this is the fearful stinger, Cyanea capillata." </span>
<span sid='18427' title='18427'>Could our sinister acquaintance be more clearly described?</span>
<p>
<span sid='18428' title='18428'>'He goes on to tell his own encounter with one when swimming off the coast of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kent&t=h'>Kent</a>. </span>
<span sid='18429' title='18429'>He found that the creature radiated almost invisible filaments to the distance of fifty feet, and that anyone within that circumference from the deadly centre was in danger of death. </span>
<span sid='18430' title='18430'>Even at a distance the effect upon Wood was almost fatal. </span>
<span sid='18431' title='18431'>"The multitudinous threads caused light scarlet lines upon the skin which on closer examination resolved into minute dots or pustules, each dot charged as it were with a red-hot needle making its way through the nerves."</span>
<p>
<span sid='18432' title='18432'>'The local pain was, as he explains, the least part of the exquisite torment. </span>
<span sid='18433' title='18433'>"Pangs shot through the chest, causing me to fall if as struck by a bullet. </span>
<span sid='18434' title='18434'>The pulsation would cease, and then the heart would give six or seven leaps as if it would force its way through the chest."</span>
<p>
<span sid='18435' title='18435'>'It nearly killed him, although he had only been exposed to it in the disturbed ocean and not in the narrow calm waters of a bathing pool. </span>
<span sid='18436' title='18436'>He says that he could hardly recognize himself afterwards, so white, wrinkled and shrivelled was his face. </span>
<span sid='18437' title='18437'>He gulped down brandy, a whole bottleful, and it seems to have saved his life. </span>
<span sid='18438' title='18438'>There is the book, Inspector. </span>
<span sid='18439' title='18439'>I leave it with you, and you cannot doubt that it contains a full explanation of the tragedy of poor McPherson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18440' title='18440'>'And incidentally exonerates me,' remarked Ian Murdoch with a wry smile. </span>
<span sid='18441' title='18441'>'I do not blame you, Inspector, nor you, Mr Holmes, for your suspicions were natural. </span>
<span sid='18442' title='18442'>I feel that on the very eve of my arrest I have only cleared myself by sharing the fate of my poor friend.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18443' title='18443'>'No, Mr Murdoch. </span>
<span sid='18444' title='18444'>I was already upon the track, and had I been out as early as I intended I might well have saved you from this terrific experience.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18445' title='18445'>'But how did you know, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18446' title='18446'>'I am an omnivorous reader with a strangely retentive memory for trifles. </span>
<span sid='18447' title='18447'>That phrase "Lion's Mane" haunted my mind. </span>
<span sid='18448' title='18448'>I knew that I had seen it somewhere in an unexpected context. </span>
<span sid='18449' title='18449'>You have seen that it does describe the creature. </span>
<span sid='18450' title='18450'>I have no doubt that it was floating on the water when McPherson saw it, and that this phrase was the only one by which he could convey to us a warning as to the creature which had been his death.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18451' title='18451'>'Then I, at least, am cleared,' said Murdoch, rising slowly to his feet. </span>
<span sid='18452' title='18452'>'There are one or two words of explanation which I should give, for I know the direction in which your inquiries have run. </span>
<span sid='18453' title='18453'>It is true that I loved this lady, but from the day when she chose my friend McPherson my one desire was to help her to happiness. </span>
<span sid='18454' title='18454'>I was well content to stand aside and act as their go-between. </span>
<span sid='18455' title='18455'>Often I carried their messages, and it was because I was in their confidence and because she was so dear to me that I hastened to tell her of my friend's death, lest someone should forestall me in a more sudden and heartless manner. </span>
<span sid='18456' title='18456'>She would not tell you, sir, of our relations lest you would disapprove and I might suffer. </span>
<span sid='18457' title='18457'>But with your leave I must try to get back to The Gables, for my bed will be very welcome.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18458' title='18458'>Stackhurst held out his hand. </span>
<span sid='18459' title='18459'>'Our nerves have all been at concert pitch,' said he. </span>
<span sid='18460' title='18460'>'Forgive what is past, Murdoch. </span>
<span sid='18461' title='18461'>We shall understand each other better in the future.' </span>
<span sid='18462' title='18462'>They passed out together with their arms linked in friendly fashion. </span>
<span sid='18463' title='18463'>The Inspector remained, staring at me in silence with his ox-like eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18464' title='18464'>'Well, you've done it!' he cried at last. </span>
<span sid='18465' title='18465'>'I had read of you, but I never believed it. </span>
<span sid='18466' title='18466'>It's wonderful!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='18467' title='18467'>I was forced to shake my head. </span>
<span sid='18468' title='18468'>To accept such praise was to lower one's own standards.</span>
<p>
<span sid='18469' title='18469'>'I was slow at the outset - culpably slow. </span>
<span sid='18470' title='18470'>Had the body been found in the water I could hardly have missed it. </span>
<span sid='18471' title='18471'>It was the towel which misled me. </span>
<span sid='18472' title='18472'>The poor fellow had never thought to dry himself, and so I in turn was led to believe that he had never been in the water. </span>
<span sid='18473' title='18473'>Why, then, should the attack of any water creature suggest itself to me? </span>
<span sid='18474' title='18474'>That was where I went astray. </span>
<span sid='18475' title='18475'>Well, well, Inspector, I often ventured to chaff you gentlemen of the police force, but Cyanea capillata very nearly avenged <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>.'</span>
