<p>
<span sid='43498' title='43498'>Sherlock Holmes was in a melancholy and philosophic mood that morning. </span>
<span sid='43499' title='43499'>His alert practical nature was subject to such reactions.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43500' title='43500'>'Did you see him?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43501' title='43501'>'You mean the old fellow who has just gone out?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43502' title='43502'>'Precisely.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43503' title='43503'>'Yes, I met him at the door.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43504' title='43504'>'What did you think of him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43505' title='43505'>'A pathetic, futile, broken creature.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43506' title='43506'>'Exactly, Watson. </span>
<span sid='43507' title='43507'>Pathetic and futile. </span>
<span sid='43508' title='43508'>But is not all life pathetic and futile? </span>
<span sid='43509' title='43509'>Is not his story a microcosm of the whole? </span>
<span sid='43510' title='43510'>We reach. </span>
<span sid='43511' title='43511'>We grasp. </span>
<span sid='43512' title='43512'>And what is left in our hands at the end? </span>
<span sid='43513' title='43513'>A shadow. </span>
<span sid='43514' title='43514'>Or worse than a shadow - misery.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43515' title='43515'>'Is he one of your clients?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43516' title='43516'>'Well, I suppose I may call him so. </span>
<span sid='43517' title='43517'>He has been sent on by the Yard. </span>
<span sid='43518' title='43518'>Just as medical men occasionally send their incurables to a quack. </span>
<span sid='43519' title='43519'>They argue that they can do nothing more, and that whatever happens the patient can be no worse than he is.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43520' title='43520'>'What is the matter?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43521' title='43521'>Holmes took a rather soiled card from the table. </span>
<span sid='43522' title='43522'>'Josiah Amberley. </span>
<span sid='43523' title='43523'>He says he was junior partner of Brickfall and Amberley, who are manufacturers of artistic materials. </span>
<span sid='43524' title='43524'>You will see their names upon paint-boxes. </span>
<span sid='43525' title='43525'>He made his little pile, retired from business at the age of sixty-one, bought a house at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lewisham&t=h'>Lewisham</a> and settled down to rest after a life of ceaseless grind. </span>
<span sid='43526' title='43526'>One would think his future was tolerably assured.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43527' title='43527'>'Yes, indeed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43528' title='43528'>Holmes glanced over some notes which he had scribbled upon the back of an envelope.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43529' title='43529'>'Retired in 1896, Watson. </span>
<span sid='43530' title='43530'>Early in 1897 he married a woman twenty years younger than himself - a good-looking woman, too, if the photograph does not flatter. </span>
<span sid='43531' title='43531'>A competence, a wife, leisure - it seemed a straight road which lay before him. </span>
<span sid='43532' title='43532'>And yet within two years he is, as you have seen, as broken and miserable a creature as crawls beneath the sun.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43533' title='43533'>'But what has happened?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43534' title='43534'>'The old story, Watson. </span>
<span sid='43535' title='43535'>A treacherous friend and a fickle wife. </span>
<span sid='43536' title='43536'>It would appear that Amberley has one hobby in life, and it is chess. </span>
<span sid='43537' title='43537'>Not far from him at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lewisham&t=h'>Lewisham</a> there lives a young doctor who is also a chess-player. </span>
<span sid='43538' title='43538'>I have noted his name as Dr Ray Ernest. </span>
<span sid='43539' title='43539'>Ernest was frequently in the house, and an intimacy between him and Mrs Amberley was a natural sequence, for you must admit that our unfortunate client has few outward graces, whatever his inner virtues may be. </span>
<span sid='43540' title='43540'>The couple went off together last week - destination untraced. </span>
<span sid='43541' title='43541'>What is more, the faithless spouse carried off the old man's deed-box as her personal luggage with a good part of his life's savings within. </span>
<span sid='43542' title='43542'>Can we find the lady? </span>
<span sid='43543' title='43543'>Can we save the money? </span>
<span sid='43544' title='43544'>A commonplace problem so far as it has developed, and yet a vital one for Josiah Amberley.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43545' title='43545'>'What will you do about it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43546' title='43546'>'Well, the immediate question, my dear Watson, happens to be, What will you do? - if you will be good enough to understudy me. </span>
<span sid='43547' title='43547'>You know that I am preoccupied with this case of the two Coptic Patriarchs, which should come to a head to-day. </span>
<span sid='43548' title='43548'>I really have not time to go out to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lewisham&t=h'>Lewisham</a>, and yet evidence taken on the spot has a special value. </span>
<span sid='43549' title='43549'>The old fellow was quite insistent that I should go, but I explained my difficulty. </span>
<span sid='43550' title='43550'>He is prepared to meet a representative.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43551' title='43551'>'By all means.' I answered. </span>
<span sid='43552' title='43552'>'I confess I don't see that I can be of much service, but I am willing to do my best.' </span>
<span sid='43553' title='43553'>And so it was that on a summer afternoon I set forth to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lewisham&t=h'>Lewisham</a>, little dreaming that within a week the affair in which I was engaging would be the eager debate of all <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43554' title='43554'>It was late that evening before I returned to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> and gave an account of my mission. </span>
<span sid='43555' title='43555'>Holmes lay with his gaunt figure stretched in his deep chair, his pipe curling forth slow wreaths of acrid tobacco, while his eyelids drooped over his eyes so lazily that he might almost have been asleep were it not that at any halt or questionable passage of my narrative they half lifted, and two grey eyes, as bright and keen as rapiers, transfixed me with their searching glance.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43556' title='43556'>'The Haven is the name of Mr Josiah Amberley's house,' I explained. </span>
<span sid='43557' title='43557'>'I think it would interest you, Holmes. </span>
<span sid='43558' title='43558'>It is like some penurious patrician who has sunk into the company of his inferiors. </span>
<span sid='43559' title='43559'>You know that particular quarter, the monotonous brick streets, the weary suburban highways. </span>
<span sid='43560' title='43560'>Right in the middle of them, a little island of ancient culture and comfort, lies this old home, surrounded by a high sun-baked wall, mottled with lichens and topped with moss, the sort of wall-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43561' title='43561'>'Cut out the poetry, Watson,' said Holmes, severely. </span>
<span sid='43562' title='43562'>'I note that it was a high brick wall.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43563' title='43563'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='43564' title='43564'>I should not have known which was The Haven had I not asked a lounger who was smoking in the street. </span>
<span sid='43565' title='43565'>I have reason for mentioning him. </span>
<span sid='43566' title='43566'>He was a tall, dark, heavily-moustached, rather military-looking man. </span>
<span sid='43567' title='43567'>He nodded in answer to my inquiry and gave me a curiously questioning glance, which came back to my memory a little later.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43568' title='43568'>'I had hardly entered the gateway before I saw Mr Amberley coming down the drive. </span>
<span sid='43569' title='43569'>I only had a glimpse of him this morning, and he certainly gave me the impression of a strange creature, but when I saw him in full light his appearance was even more abnormal.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43570' title='43570'>'I have, of course, studied it, and yet I should be interested to have your impression,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43571' title='43571'>'He seemed to me like a man who was literally bowed down by care. </span>
<span sid='43572' title='43572'>His back was curved as though he carried a heavy burden. </span>
<span sid='43573' title='43573'>Yet he was not the weakling that I had at first imagined, for his shoulders and chest have the framework of a giant, though his figure tapers away into a pair of spindled legs.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43574' title='43574'>'Left shoe wrinkled, right one smooth.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43575' title='43575'>'I did not observe that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43576' title='43576'>'No, you wouldn't. </span>
<span sid='43577' title='43577'>I spotted his artificial limb. </span>
<span sid='43578' title='43578'>But proceed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43579' title='43579'>'I was struck by the snaky locks of grizzled hair which curled from under his old straw hat, and his face with its fierce, eager expression and the deeply-lined features.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43580' title='43580'>'Very good, Watson. </span>
<span sid='43581' title='43581'>What did he say?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43582' title='43582'>'He began pouring out the story of his grievances. </span>
<span sid='43583' title='43583'>We walked down the drive together, and of course I took a good look round. </span>
<span sid='43584' title='43584'>I have never seen a worse-kept place. </span>
<span sid='43585' title='43585'>The garden was all running to seed, giving me an impression of wild neglect in which the plants had been allowed to find the way of nature rather than of art. </span>
<span sid='43586' title='43586'>How any decent woman could have tolerated such a state of things, I don't know. </span>
<span sid='43587' title='43587'>The house, too, was slatternly to the last degree, but the poor man seemed himself to be aware of it and to be trying to remedy it, for a great pot of green paint stood in the centre of the hall and he was carrying a thick brush in his left hand. </span>
<span sid='43588' title='43588'>He had been working on the woodwork.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43589' title='43589'>'He took me into his dingy sanctum, and we had a long chat. </span>
<span sid='43590' title='43590'>Of course, he was disappointed that you had not come yourself. </span>
<span sid='43591' title='43591'>"I hardly expected," he said, "that so humble an individual as myself, especially after my heavy financial loss, could obtain the complete attention of so famous a man as Mr Sherlock Holmes."</span>
<p>
<span sid='43592' title='43592'>'I assured him that the financial question did not arise. </span>
<span sid='43593' title='43593'>"No, of course, it is art for art's sake with him," said he, "but even on the artistic side of crime he might have found something here to study. </span>
<span sid='43594' title='43594'>And human nature, Dr Watson-the black ingratitude of it all! </span>
<span sid='43595' title='43595'>When did I ever refuse one of her requests? </span>
<span sid='43596' title='43596'>Was ever a woman so pampered? </span>
<span sid='43597' title='43597'>And that young man - he might have been my own son. </span>
<span sid='43598' title='43598'>He had the run of my house. </span>
<span sid='43599' title='43599'>And yet see how they have treated me! </span>
<span sid='43600' title='43600'>Oh, Dr Watson, it is a dreadful, dreadful world!"</span>
<p>
<span sid='43601' title='43601'>'That was the burden of his song for an hour or more. </span>
<span sid='43602' title='43602'>He had, it seems, no suspicion of an intrigue. </span>
<span sid='43603' title='43603'>They lived alone save for a woman who comes in by the day and leaves every evening at six. </span>
<span sid='43604' title='43604'>On that particular evening old Amberley, wishing to give his wife a treat, had taken two upper circle seats at the Haymarket Theatre. </span>
<span sid='43605' title='43605'>At the last moment she had complained of a headache and had refused to go. </span>
<span sid='43606' title='43606'>He had gone alone. </span>
<span sid='43607' title='43607'>There seemed to be no doubt about the fact, for he produced the unused ticket which he had taken for his wife.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43608' title='43608'>'That is remarkable - most remarkable,' said Holmes, whose interest in the case seemed to be rising. </span>
<span sid='43609' title='43609'>'Pray continue, Watson. </span>
<span sid='43610' title='43610'>I find your narrative most arresting. </span>
<span sid='43611' title='43611'>Did you personally examine this ticket? </span>
<span sid='43612' title='43612'>You did not, perchance, take the number?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43613' title='43613'>'It so happens that I did,' I answered with some pride. </span>
<span sid='43614' title='43614'>'It chanced to be my old school number, thirty-one, and so it stuck in my head.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43615' title='43615'>'Excellent, Watson! </span>
<span sid='43616' title='43616'>His seat, then, was either thirty or thirty-two.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43617' title='43617'>'Quite so,' I answered, with some mystification. </span>
<span sid='43618' title='43618'>'And on B row.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43619' title='43619'>'That is most satisfactory. </span>
<span sid='43620' title='43620'>What else did he tell you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43621' title='43621'>'He showed me his strong-room, as he called it. </span>
<span sid='43622' title='43622'>It really is a strong-room - like a bank - with iron door and shutter-burglar-proof, as he claimed. </span>
<span sid='43623' title='43623'>However, the woman seems to have had a duplicate key, and between them they had carried off some seven thousand pounds' worth of cash and securities.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43624' title='43624'>'Securities! </span>
<span sid='43625' title='43625'>How could they dispose of those?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43626' title='43626'>'He said that he had given the police a list and that he hoped they would be unsaleable. </span>
<span sid='43627' title='43627'>He had got back from the theatre about midnight, and found the place plundered, the door and window open, and the fugitives gone. </span>
<span sid='43628' title='43628'>There was no letter or message, nor has he heard a word since. </span>
<span sid='43629' title='43629'>He at once gave the alarm to the police.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43630' title='43630'>Holmes brooded for some minutes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43631' title='43631'>'You say he was painting. </span>
<span sid='43632' title='43632'>What was he painting?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43633' title='43633'>'Well, he was painting the passage. </span>
<span sid='43634' title='43634'>But he had already painted the door and woodwork of this room I spoke of.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43635' title='43635'>'Does it strike you as a strange occupation in the circumstances?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43636' title='43636'>'"One must do something to ease an aching heart." </span>
<span sid='43637' title='43637'>That was his own explanation. </span>
<span sid='43638' title='43638'>It was eccentric, no doubt, but he is clearly an eccentric man. </span>
<span sid='43639' title='43639'>He tore up one of his wife's photographs in my presence - tore it up furiously in a tempest of passion. </span>
<span sid='43640' title='43640'>"I never wish to see her damned face again," he shrieked.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43641' title='43641'>'Anything more, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43642' title='43642'>'Yes, one thing which struck me more than anything else. </span>
<span sid='43643' title='43643'>I had driven to the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Blackheath&t=h'>Blackheath</a> Station and had caught my train there, when just as it was starting I saw a man dart into the carriage next to my own. </span>
<span sid='43644' title='43644'>You know that I have a quick eye for faces, Holmes. </span>
<span sid='43645' title='43645'>It was undoubtedly the tall, dark man whom I had addressed in the street. </span>
<span sid='43646' title='43646'>I saw him once more at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> Bridge, and then I lost him in the crowd. </span>
<span sid='43647' title='43647'>But I am convinced that he was following me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43648' title='43648'>'No doubt! </span>
<span sid='43649' title='43649'>No doubt!' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='43650' title='43650'>'A tall, dark, heavilymoustached man, you say, with grey-tinted sunglasses?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43651' title='43651'>'Holmes, you are a wizard. </span>
<span sid='43652' title='43652'>I did not say so, but he had grey-tinted sun-glasses.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43653' title='43653'>'And a Masonic tie-pin?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43654' title='43654'>'Holmes!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43655' title='43655'>'Quite simple, my dear Watson. </span>
<span sid='43656' title='43656'>But let us get down to what is practical. </span>
<span sid='43657' title='43657'>I must admit to you that the case, which seemed to me to be so absurdly simple as to be hardly worth my notice, is rapidly assuming a very different aspect. </span>
<span sid='43658' title='43658'>It is true that though in your mission you have missed everything of importance, yet even those things which have obtruded themselves upon your notice give rise to serious thought.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43659' title='43659'>'What have I missed?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43660' title='43660'>'Don't be hurt, my dear fellow. </span>
<span sid='43661' title='43661'>You know that I am quite impersonal. </span>
<span sid='43662' title='43662'>No one else would have done better. </span>
<span sid='43663' title='43663'>Some possibly not so well. </span>
<span sid='43664' title='43664'>But clearly you have missed some vital points. </span>
<span sid='43665' title='43665'>What is the opinion of the neighbours about this man Amberley and his wife? </span>
<span sid='43666' title='43666'>That surely is of importance. </span>
<span sid='43667' title='43667'>What of Dr Ernest? </span>
<span sid='43668' title='43668'>Was he the gay Lothario one would expect? </span>
<span sid='43669' title='43669'>With your natural advantages, Watson, every lady is your helper and accomplice. </span>
<span sid='43670' title='43670'>What about the girl at the post office, or the wife of the greengrocer? </span>
<span sid='43671' title='43671'>I can picture you whispering soft nothings with the young lady at the "Blue Anchor", and receiving hard somethings in exchange. </span>
<span sid='43672' title='43672'>All this you have left undone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43673' title='43673'>'It can still be done.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43674' title='43674'>'It has been done. </span>
<span sid='43675' title='43675'>Thanks to the telephone and the help of the Yard, I can usually get my essentials without leaving this room. </span>
<span sid='43676' title='43676'>As a matter of fact, my information confirms the man's story. </span>
<span sid='43677' title='43677'>He has the local repute of being a miser as well as a harsh and exacting husband. </span>
<span sid='43678' title='43678'>That he had a large sum of money in that strong-room of his is certain. </span>
<span sid='43679' title='43679'>So also is it that young Dr Ernest, an unmarried man, played chess with Amberley, and probably played the fool with his wife. </span>
<span sid='43680' title='43680'>All this seems plain sailing, and one would think that there was no more to be said - and yet! - and yet!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43681' title='43681'>'Where lies the difficulty?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43682' title='43682'>'In my imagination, perhaps. </span>
<span sid='43683' title='43683'>Well, leave it there, Watson. </span>
<span sid='43684' title='43684'>Let us escape from this weary workaday world by the side door of music. </span>
<span sid='43685' title='43685'>Carina sings to-night at the Albert Hall, and we still have time to dress, dine and enjoy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43686' title='43686'>In the morning I was up betimes, but some toast crumbs and two empty eggshells told me that my companion was earlier still. </span>
<span sid='43687' title='43687'>I found a scribbled note on the table.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43688' title='43688'>Dear Watson,</span>
<p>
<span sid='43689' title='43689'>There are one or two points of contact which I should wish to establish with Mr Josiah Amberley. </span>
<span sid='43690' title='43690'>When I have done so we can dismiss the case - or not. </span>
<span sid='43691' title='43691'>I would only ask you to be on hand about three o'clock, as I conceive it possible that I may want you.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43692' title='43692'>S. H.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43693' title='43693'>I saw nothing of Holmes all day, but at the hour named he returned, grave, preoccupied and aloof. </span>
<span sid='43694' title='43694'>At such times it was easier to leave him to himself.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43695' title='43695'>'Has Amberley been here yet?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43696' title='43696'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43697' title='43697'>'Ah! </span>
<span sid='43698' title='43698'>I am expecting him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43699' title='43699'>He was not disappointed, for presently the old fellow arrived with a very worried and puzzled expression upon his austere face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43700' title='43700'>'I've had a telegram, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='43701' title='43701'>I can make nothing of it.' </span>
<span sid='43702' title='43702'>He handed it over, and Holmes read it aloud.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43703' title='43703'>Come at once without fail. </span>
<span sid='43704' title='43704'>Can give you information as to your recent loss. </span>
<span sid='43705' title='43705'>- ELMAN. </span>
<span sid='43706' title='43706'>The Vicarage.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43707' title='43707'>'Dispatched at two-ten from Little Purlington,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='43708' title='43708'>'Little Purlington is in Essex, I believe, not far from Frinton. </span>
<span sid='43709' title='43709'>Well, of course you will start at once. </span>
<span sid='43710' title='43710'>This is evidently from a responsible person, the vicar of the place. </span>
<span sid='43711' title='43711'>Where is my Crockford? </span>
<span sid='43712' title='43712'>Yes, here we have him. </span>
<span sid='43713' title='43713'>J. C. Elman, MA, Living of Mossmoor cum Little Purlington. </span>
<span sid='43714' title='43714'>Look up the trains, Watson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43715' title='43715'>'There is one at five-twenty from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Liverpool&t=h'>Liverpool</a> Street.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43716' title='43716'>'Excellent. </span>
<span sid='43717' title='43717'>You had best go with him, Watson. </span>
<span sid='43718' title='43718'>He may need help or advice. </span>
<span sid='43719' title='43719'>Clearly we have come to a crisis in this affair.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43720' title='43720'>But our client seemed by no means eager to start.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43721' title='43721'>'It's perfectly absurd, Mr Holmes,' he said. </span>
<span sid='43722' title='43722'>'What can this man possibly know of what has occurred? </span>
<span sid='43723' title='43723'>It is waste of time and money.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43724' title='43724'>'He would not have telegraphed to you if he did not know something. </span>
<span sid='43725' title='43725'>Wire at once that you are coming.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43726' title='43726'>'I don't think I shall go.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43727' title='43727'>Holmes assumed his sternest aspect.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43728' title='43728'>'It would make the worst possible impression both on the police and upon myself, Mr Amberley, if when so obvious a clue arose you should refuse to follow it up. </span>
<span sid='43729' title='43729'>We should feel that you were not really in earnest in this investigation.' </span>
<span sid='43730' title='43730'>Our client seemed horrified at the suggestion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43731' title='43731'>'Why, of course I shall go if you look at it in that way,' said he. </span>
<span sid='43732' title='43732'>'On the face of it, it seems absurd to suppose that this parson knows anything, but if you think-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43733' title='43733'>'I do think,' said Holmes, with emphasis, and so we were launched upon our journey. </span>
<span sid='43734' title='43734'>Holmes took me aside before we left the room and gave me one word of counsel which showed that he considered the matter to be of importance. </span>
<span sid='43735' title='43735'>'Whatever you do, see that he really does go,' said he. </span>
<span sid='43736' title='43736'>'Should he break away or return, get to the nearest telephone exchange and send the single word "Bolted". </span>
<span sid='43737' title='43737'>I will arrange here that it shall reach me wherever I am.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43738' title='43738'>Little Purlington is not an easy place to reach, for it is on a branch line. </span>
<span sid='43739' title='43739'>My remembrance of the journey is not a pleasant one, for the weather was hot, the train slow, and my companion sullen and silent, hardly talking at all, save to make an occasional sardonic remark as to the futility of our proceedings. </span>
<span sid='43740' title='43740'>When we at last reached the little station it was a two-mile drive before we came to the Vicarage, where a big, solemn, rather pompous clergyman received us in his study. </span>
<span sid='43741' title='43741'>Our telegram lay before him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43742' title='43742'>'Well, gentlemen,' he asked, 'what can I do for you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43743' title='43743'>'We came,' I explained, 'in answer to your wire.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43744' title='43744'>'My wire! </span>
<span sid='43745' title='43745'>I sent no wire.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43746' title='43746'>'I mean the wire which you sent to Mr Josiah Amberley about his wife and his money.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43747' title='43747'>'If this is a joke, sir, it is a very questionable one,' said the vicar angrily. </span>
<span sid='43748' title='43748'>'I have never heard of the gentleman you name, and I have not sent a wire to anyone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43749' title='43749'>Our client and I looked at each other in amazement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43750' title='43750'>'Perhaps there is some mistake,' said I, 'are there perhaps two vicarages? </span>
<span sid='43751' title='43751'>Here is the wire itself, signed Elman, and dated from the Vicarage.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43752' title='43752'>'There is only one vicarage, sir, and only one vicar, and this wire is a scandalous forgery, the origin of which shall certainly be investigated by the police. </span>
<span sid='43753' title='43753'>Meanwhile, I can see no possible object in prolonging this interview.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43754' title='43754'>So Mr Amberley and I found ourselves on the roadside in what seemed to me to be the most primitive village in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>. </span>
<span sid='43755' title='43755'>We made for the telegraph office, but it was already closed. </span>
<span sid='43756' title='43756'>There was a telephone, however, at the little 'Railway Arms', and by it I got into touch with Holmes, who shared in our amazement at the result of our journey.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43757' title='43757'>'Most singular!' said the distant voice. </span>
<span sid='43758' title='43758'>'Most remarkable! </span>
<span sid='43759' title='43759'>I much fear, my dear Watson, that there is no return train tonight. </span>
<span sid='43760' title='43760'>I have unwittingly condemned you to the horrors of a country inn. </span>
<span sid='43761' title='43761'>However, there is always Nature, Watson - Nature and Josiah Amberley - you can be in close commune with both.' </span>
<span sid='43762' title='43762'>I heard his dry chuckle as he turned away.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43763' title='43763'>It was soon apparent to me that my companion's reputation as a miser was not undeserved. </span>
<span sid='43764' title='43764'>He had grumbled at the expense of the journey, had insisted upon travelling thirdclass, and was now clamorous in his objections to the hotel bill. </span>
<span sid='43765' title='43765'>Next morning, when we did at last arrive in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, it was hard to say which of us was in the worse humour.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43766' title='43766'>'You had best take <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> as we pass,' said I. </span>
<span sid='43767' title='43767'>'Mr Holmes may have some fresh instructions.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43768' title='43768'>'If they are not worth more than the last ones they are not of much use,' said Amberley, with a malevolent scowl. </span>
<span sid='43769' title='43769'>None the less, he kept me company. </span>
<span sid='43770' title='43770'>I had already warned Holmes by telegram of the hour of our arrival, but we found a message waiting that he was at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lewisham&t=h'>Lewisham</a>, and would expect us there. </span>
<span sid='43771' title='43771'>That was a surprise, but an even greater one was to find that he was not alone in the sitting-room of our client. </span>
<span sid='43772' title='43772'>A stern-looking, impassive man sat beside him, a dark man with grey-tinted glasses and a large Masonic pin projecting from his tie.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43773' title='43773'>'This is my friend Mr Barker,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='43774' title='43774'>'He has been interesting himself also in your business, Mr Josiah Amberley, though we have been working independently. </span>
<span sid='43775' title='43775'>But we have both the same question to ask you!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43776' title='43776'>Mr Amberley sat down heavily. </span>
<span sid='43777' title='43777'>He sensed impending danger. </span>
<span sid='43778' title='43778'>I read it in his straining eyes and his twitching features.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43779' title='43779'>'What is the question, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43780' title='43780'>'Only this: </span>
<span sid='43781' title='43781'>What did you do with the bodies?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43782' title='43782'>The man sprang to his feet with a hoarse scream. </span>
<span sid='43783' title='43783'>He clawed into the air with his bony hands. </span>
<span sid='43784' title='43784'>His mouth was open and for the instant he looked like some horrible bird of prey. </span>
<span sid='43785' title='43785'>In a flash we got a glimpse of the real Josiah Amberley, a misshapen demon with a soul as distorted as his body. </span>
<span sid='43786' title='43786'>As he fell back into his chair he clapped his hand to his lips as if to stifle a cough. </span>
<span sid='43787' title='43787'>Holmes sprang at his throat like a tiger, and twisted his face towards the ground. </span>
<span sid='43788' title='43788'>A white pellet fell from between his gasping lips.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43789' title='43789'>'No short cuts, Josiah Amberley. </span>
<span sid='43790' title='43790'>Things must be done decently and in order. </span>
<span sid='43791' title='43791'>What about it, Barker?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43792' title='43792'>'I have a cab at the door,' said our taciturn companion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43793' title='43793'>'It is only a few hundred yards to the station. </span>
<span sid='43794' title='43794'>We will go together. </span>
<span sid='43795' title='43795'>You can stay here, Watson. </span>
<span sid='43796' title='43796'>I shall be back within half an hour.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43797' title='43797'>The old colourman had the strength of a lion in that great trunk of his, but he was helpless in the hands of the two experienced man-handlers. </span>
<span sid='43798' title='43798'>Wriggling and twisting, he was dragged to the waiting cab, and I was left to my solitary vigil in the ill-omened house. </span>
<span sid='43799' title='43799'>In less time than he had named, however, Holmes was back, in company with a smart young police inspector.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43800' title='43800'>'I've left Barker to look after the formalities,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='43801' title='43801'>'You had not met Barker, Watson. </span>
<span sid='43802' title='43802'>He is my hated rival upon the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Surrey&t=h'>Surrey</a> shore. </span>
<span sid='43803' title='43803'>When you said a tall dark man it was not difficult for me to complete the picture. </span>
<span sid='43804' title='43804'>He has several good cases to his credit, has he not, Inspector?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43805' title='43805'>'He has certainly interfered several times,' the Inspector answered with reserve.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43806' title='43806'>'His methods are irregular, no doubt, like my own. </span>
<span sid='43807' title='43807'>The irregulars are useful sometimes, you know. </span>
<span sid='43808' title='43808'>You, for example, with your compulsory warning about whatever he said being used against him, could never have bluffed this rascal into what is virtually a confession.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43809' title='43809'>'Perhaps not. </span>
<span sid='43810' title='43810'>But we get there all the same, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='43811' title='43811'>Don't imagine that we had not formed our own views of this case, and that we would not have laid our hands on our man. </span>
<span sid='43812' title='43812'>You will excuse us for feeling sore when you jump in with methods which we cannot use, and so rob us of the credit.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43813' title='43813'>'There shall be no such robbery, MacKinnon. </span>
<span sid='43814' title='43814'>I assure you that I efface myself from now onwards, and as to Barker, he had done nothing save what I told him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43815' title='43815'>The Inspector seemed considerably relieved.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43816' title='43816'>'That is very handsome of you, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='43817' title='43817'>Praise or blame can matter little to you, but it is very different to us when the newspapers begin to ask questions.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43818' title='43818'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='43819' title='43819'>But they are pretty sure to ask questions anyhow, so it would be as well to have answers. </span>
<span sid='43820' title='43820'>What will you say, for example, when the intelligent and enterprising reporter asks you what the exact points were which aroused your suspicion, and finally gave you a certain conviction as to the real facts?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43821' title='43821'>The Inspector looked puzzled.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43822' title='43822'>'We don't seem to have got any real facts yet, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='43823' title='43823'>You say that the prisoner, in the presence of three witnesses, practically confessed, by trying to commit suicide, that he had murdered his wife and her lover. </span>
<span sid='43824' title='43824'>What other facts have you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43825' title='43825'>'Have you arranged for a search?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43826' title='43826'>'There are three constables on their way.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43827' title='43827'>'Then you will soon get the clearest fact of all. </span>
<span sid='43828' title='43828'>The bodies cannot be far away. </span>
<span sid='43829' title='43829'>Try the cellars and the garden. </span>
<span sid='43830' title='43830'>It should not take long to dig up the likely places. </span>
<span sid='43831' title='43831'>This house is older than the water-pipes. </span>
<span sid='43832' title='43832'>There must be a disused well somewhere. </span>
<span sid='43833' title='43833'>Try your luck there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43834' title='43834'>'But how did you know of it, and how was it done?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43835' title='43835'>'I'll show you first how it was done, and then I will give the explanation which is due to you, and even more to my long-suffering friend here, who has been invaluable throughout. </span>
<span sid='43836' title='43836'>But, first, I would give you an insight into this man's mentality. </span>
<span sid='43837' title='43837'>It is a very unusual one - so much so that I think his destination is more likely to be Broadmoor than the scaffold. </span>
<span sid='43838' title='43838'>He has, to a high degree, the sort of mind which one associates with the medieval Italian nature rather than with the modern Briton. </span>
<span sid='43839' title='43839'>He was a miserable miser who made his wife so wretched by his niggardly ways that she was a ready prey for any adventurer. </span>
<span sid='43840' title='43840'>Such a one came upon the scene in the person of this chess-playing doctor. </span>
<span sid='43841' title='43841'>Amberley excelled at chess - one mark, Watson, of a scheming mind. </span>
<span sid='43842' title='43842'>Like all misers, he was a jealous man, and his jealousy became a frantic mania. </span>
<span sid='43843' title='43843'>Rightly or wrongly, he suspected an intrigue. </span>
<span sid='43844' title='43844'>He determined to have his revenge, and he planned it with diabolical cleverness. </span>
<span sid='43845' title='43845'>Come here!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43846' title='43846'>Holmes led us along the passage with as much certainty as if he had lived in the house, and halted at the open door of the strong-room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43847' title='43847'>'Pooh! </span>
<span sid='43848' title='43848'>What an awful smell of paint!' cried the Inspector.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43849' title='43849'>'That was our first clue,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='43850' title='43850'>'You can thank Dr Watson's observation for that, though he failed to draw the inference. </span>
<span sid='43851' title='43851'>It set my foot upon the trail. </span>
<span sid='43852' title='43852'>Why should this man at such a time be filling his house with strong odours? </span>
<span sid='43853' title='43853'>Obviously, to cover some other smell which he wished to conceal - some guilty smell which would suggest suspicions. </span>
<span sid='43854' title='43854'>Then came the idea of a room such as you see here with the iron door and shutter - a hermetically sealed room. </span>
<span sid='43855' title='43855'>Put those two facts together, and whither do they lead? </span>
<span sid='43856' title='43856'>I could only determine that by examining the house myself. </span>
<span sid='43857' title='43857'>I was already certain that the case was serious, for I had examined the box-office chart at the Haymarket Theatre - another of Dr Watson's bull's-eyes - and ascertained that neither B thirty nor thirty-two of the upper circle had been occupied that night. </span>
<span sid='43858' title='43858'>Therefore, Amberley had not been to the theatre, and his alibi fell to the ground. </span>
<span sid='43859' title='43859'>He made a bad slip when he allowed my astute friend to notice the number of the seat taken for his wife. </span>
<span sid='43860' title='43860'>The question now arose how I might be able to examine the house. </span>
<span sid='43861' title='43861'>I sent an agent to the most impossible village I could think of, and summoned my man to it at such an hour that he could not possibly get back. </span>
<span sid='43862' title='43862'>To prevent any miscarriage, Dr Watson accompanied him. </span>
<span sid='43863' title='43863'>The good vicar's name I took, of course, out of my Crockford. </span>
<span sid='43864' title='43864'>Do I make it all clear to you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43865' title='43865'>'It is masterly,' said the Inspector, in an awed voice.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43866' title='43866'>'There being no fear of interruption I proceeded to burgle the house. </span>
<span sid='43867' title='43867'>Burglary has always been an alternative profession, had I cared to adopt it, and I have little doubt that I should have come to the front. </span>
<span sid='43868' title='43868'>Observe what I found. </span>
<span sid='43869' title='43869'>You see the gas-pipe along the skirting here. </span>
<span sid='43870' title='43870'>Very good. </span>
<span sid='43871' title='43871'>It rises in the angle of the wall, and there is a tap here in the corner. </span>
<span sid='43872' title='43872'>The pipe runs out into the strong-room, as you can see, and ends in that plastered rose in the centre of the ceiling, where it is concealed by the ornamentation. </span>
<span sid='43873' title='43873'>That end is wide open. </span>
<span sid='43874' title='43874'>At any moment by turning the outside tap the room could be flooded with gas. </span>
<span sid='43875' title='43875'>With door and shutter closed and the tap full on I would not give two minutes of conscious sensation to anyone shut up in that little chamber. </span>
<span sid='43876' title='43876'>By what devilish device he decoyed them there I do not know, but once inside the door they were at his mercy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43877' title='43877'>The Inspector examined the pipe with interest. </span>
<span sid='43878' title='43878'>'One of our officers mentioned the smell of gas,' said he, 'but, of course, the window and door were open then, and the paint - or some of it - was already about. </span>
<span sid='43879' title='43879'>He had begun the work of painting the day before, according to his story. </span>
<span sid='43880' title='43880'>But what next, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43881' title='43881'>'Well, then came an incident which was rather unexpected to myself. </span>
<span sid='43882' title='43882'>I was slipping through the pantry window in the early dawn when I felt a hand inside my collar, and a voice said: </span>
<span sid='43883' title='43883'>"Now, you rascal, what are you doing in there?" </span>
<span sid='43884' title='43884'>When I could twist my head round I looked into the tinted spectacles of my friend and rival, Mr Barker. </span>
<span sid='43885' title='43885'>It was curious foregathering, and set us both smiling. </span>
<span sid='43886' title='43886'>It seems that he had been engaged by Dr Ray Ernest's family to make some investigations, and had come to the same conclusion as to foul play. </span>
<span sid='43887' title='43887'>He had watched the house for some days, and had spotted Dr Watson as one of the obviously suspicious characters who had called there. </span>
<span sid='43888' title='43888'>He could hardly arrest Watson, but when he saw a man actually climbing out of the pantry window there came a limit to his restraint. </span>
<span sid='43889' title='43889'>Of course, I told him how matters stood and we continued the case together.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43890' title='43890'>'Why him? </span>
<span sid='43891' title='43891'>Why not us?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43892' title='43892'>'Because it was in my mind to put that little test which answered so admirably. </span>
<span sid='43893' title='43893'>I fear you would not have gone so far.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43894' title='43894'>The Inspector smiled.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43895' title='43895'>'Well, maybe not. </span>
<span sid='43896' title='43896'>I understand that I have your word, Mr Holmes, that you step right out of the case now and that you turn all your results over to us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43897' title='43897'>'Certainly, that is always my custom.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43898' title='43898'>'Well, in the name of the Force I thank you. </span>
<span sid='43899' title='43899'>It seems a clear case, as you put it, and there can't be much difficulty over the bodies.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43900' title='43900'>'I'll show you a grim little bit of evidence,' said Holmes, and I am sure Amberley himself never observed it. </span>
<span sid='43901' title='43901'>You'll get results, Inspector, by always putting yourself in the other fellow's place, and thinking what you would do yourself. </span>
<span sid='43902' title='43902'>It takes some imagination, but it pays. </span>
<span sid='43903' title='43903'>Now, we will suppose that you were shut up in this little room, had not two minutes to live, but wanted to get even with the fiend who was probably mocking at you from the other side of the door. </span>
<span sid='43904' title='43904'>What would you do?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43905' title='43905'>'Write a message.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43906' title='43906'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='43907' title='43907'>You would like to tell people how you died. </span>
<span sid='43908' title='43908'>No use writing on paper. </span>
<span sid='43909' title='43909'>That would be seen. </span>
<span sid='43910' title='43910'>If you wrote on the wall some eye might rest upon it. </span>
<span sid='43911' title='43911'>Now, look here! </span>
<span sid='43912' title='43912'>Just above the skirting is scribbled with a purple indelible pencil: </span>
<span sid='43913' title='43913'>"We we-" That's all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43914' title='43914'>'What do you make of that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43915' title='43915'>'Well, it's only a foot above the ground. </span>
<span sid='43916' title='43916'>The poor devil was on the floor and dying when he wrote it. </span>
<span sid='43917' title='43917'>He lost his senses before he could finish.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43918' title='43918'>'He was writing, "We were murdered."'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43919' title='43919'>'That's how I read it. </span>
<span sid='43920' title='43920'>If you find an indelible pencil on the body-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43921' title='43921'>'We'll look out for it, you may be sure. </span>
<span sid='43922' title='43922'>But those securities? </span>
<span sid='43923' title='43923'>Clearly there was no robbery at all. </span>
<span sid='43924' title='43924'>And yet he did possess those bonds. </span>
<span sid='43925' title='43925'>We verified that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43926' title='43926'>'You may be sure he has them hidden in a safe place. </span>
<span sid='43927' title='43927'>When the whole elopement had passed into history he would suddenly discover them, and announce that the guilty couple had relented and sent back the plunder or had dropped it on the way.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43928' title='43928'>'You certainly seem to have met every difficulty,' said the Inspector. </span>
<span sid='43929' title='43929'>'Of course, he was bound to call us in, but why he should have gone to you I can't understand.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43930' title='43930'>'Pure swank!' Holmes answered. </span>
<span sid='43931' title='43931'>'He felt so clever and so sure of himself that he imagined no one could touch him. </span>
<span sid='43932' title='43932'>He could say to any suspicious neighbour, "Look at the steps I have taken. </span>
<span sid='43933' title='43933'>I have consulted not only the police, but even Sherlock Holmes."'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43934' title='43934'>The Inspector laughed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43935' title='43935'>'We must forgive you your "even", Mr Holmes,' said he, 'it's as workmanlike a job as I can remember.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='43936' title='43936'>A couple of days later my friend tossed across to me a copy of the bi-weekly North <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Surrey&t=h'>Surrey</a> Observer. </span>
<span sid='43937' title='43937'>Under a series of flaming headlines, which began with 'The Haven Horror' and ended with 'Brilliant Police Investigation', there was a packed column of print which gave the first consecutive account of the affair. </span>
<span sid='43938' title='43938'>The concluding paragraph is typical of the whole. </span>
<span sid='43939' title='43939'>It ran thus:</span>
<p>
<span sid='43940' title='43940'>The remarkable acumen by which Inspector MacKinnon deduced from the smell of paint that some other smell, that of gas, for example, might be concealed, the bold deduction that the strong-room might also be the death-chamber, and the subsequent inquiry which led to the discovery of the bodies in a disused well, cleverly concealed by a dog-kennel, should live in the history of crime as a standing example of the intelligence of our professional detectives.</span>
<p>
<span sid='43941' title='43941'>'Well, well, MacKinnon is a good fellow,' said Holmes, with a tolerant smile. </span>
<span sid='43942' title='43942'>'You can file it in our archives, Watson. </span>
<span sid='43943' title='43943'>Some day the true story may be told.'</span>
