<p>
<p>
<span sid='10001' title='10001'>On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic.</span>
<span sid='10002' title='10002; s=103;''>Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well-known <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Surrey&t=h'>Surrey</a> family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran.</span>
<span sid='10003' title='10003; s=104;''>The events in question occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>.</span>
<span sid='10004' title='10004; s=105;''>It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given.</span>
<span sid='10005' title='10005; s=106;''>It is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10006' title='10006'>It was early in April in the year '83 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed.</span>
<span sid='10007' title='10007; s=108;''>He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10008' title='10008'>"Very sorry to knock you up, Watson," said he, "but it's the common lot this morning.</span>
<span sid='10009' title='10009; s=110;''>Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10010' title='10010'>"What is it, then--a fire?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10011' title='10011'>"No; a client.</span>
<span sid='10012' title='10012; s=113;''>It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me.</span>
<span sid='10013' title='10013; s=114;''>She is waiting now in the sitting-room.</span>
<span sid='10014' title='10014; s=115;''>Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate.</span>
<span sid='10015' title='10015; s=116;''>Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the outset.</span>
<span sid='10016' title='10016; s=117;''>I thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you the chance."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10017' title='10017'>"My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10018' title='10018'>I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him.</span>
<span sid='10019' title='10019; s=120;''>I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room.</span>
<span sid='10020' title='10020; s=121;''>A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10021' title='10021'>"Good-morning, madam," said Holmes cheerily.</span>
<span sid='10022' title='10022; s=123;''>"My name is Sherlock Holmes.</span>
<span sid='10023' title='10023; s=124;''>This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself.</span>
<span sid='10024' title='10024; s=125;''>Ha!</span>
<span sid='10025' title='10025; s=126;''>I am glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire.</span>
<span sid='10026' title='10026; s=127;''>Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10027' title='10027'>"It is not cold which makes me shiver," said the woman in a low voice, changing her seat as requested.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10028' title='10028'>"What, then?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10029' title='10029'>"It is fear, Mr. Holmes.</span>
<span sid='10030' title='10030; s=131;''>It is terror."</span>
<span sid='10031' title='10031; s=132;''>She raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal.</span>
<span sid='10032' title='10032; s=133;''>Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard.</span>
<span sid='10033' title='10033; s=134;''>Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10034' title='10034'>"You must not fear," said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm.</span>
<span sid='10035' title='10035; s=136;''>"We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt.</span>
<span sid='10036' title='10036; s=137;''>You have come in by train this morning, I see."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10037' title='10037'>"You know me, then?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10038' title='10038'>"No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove.</span>
<span sid='10039' title='10039; s=140;''>You must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10040' title='10040'>The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10041' title='10041'>"There is no mystery, my dear madam," said he, smiling.</span>
<span sid='10042' title='10042; s=143;''>"The left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places.</span>
<span sid='10043' title='10043; s=144;''>The marks are perfectly fresh.</span>
<span sid='10044' title='10044; s=145;''>There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10045' title='10045'>"Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct," said she.</span>
<span sid='10046' title='10046; s=147;''>"I started from home before six, reached <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Leatherhead&t=h'>Leatherhead</a> at twenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo.</span>
<span sid='10047' title='10047; s=148;''>Sir, I can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues.</span>
<span sid='10048' title='10048; s=149;''>I have no one to turn to--none, save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid.</span>
<span sid='10049' title='10049; s=150;''>I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need.</span>
<span sid='10050' title='10050; s=151;''>It was from her that I had your address.</span>
<span sid='10051' title='10051; s=152;''>Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me?</span>
<span sid='10052' title='10052; s=153;''>At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10053' title='10053'>Holmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, which he consulted.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10054' title='10054'>"Farintosh," said he.</span>
<span sid='10055' title='10055; s=156;''>"Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara.</span>
<span sid='10056' title='10056; s=157;''>I think it was before your time, Watson.</span>
<span sid='10057' title='10057; s=158;''>I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend.</span>
<span sid='10058' title='10058; s=159;''>As to reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which suits you best.</span>
<span sid='10059' title='10059; s=160;''>And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10060' title='10060'>"Alas!" replied our visitor, "the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman.</span>
<span sid='10061' title='10061; s=162;''>He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes.</span>
<span sid='10062' title='10062; s=163;''>But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart.</span>
<span sid='10063' title='10063; s=164;''>You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10064' title='10064'>"I am all attention, madam."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10065' title='10065'>"My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Surrey&t=h'>Surrey</a>."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10066' title='10066'>Holmes nodded his head.</span>
<span sid='10067' title='10067; s=168;''>"The name is familiar to me," said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10068' title='10068'>"The family was at one time among the richest in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, and the estates extended over the borders into <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Berkshire&t=h'>Berkshire</a> in the north, and <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Hampshire&t=h'>Hampshire</a> in the west.</span>
<span sid='10069' title='10069; s=170;''>In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency.</span>
<span sid='10070' title='10070; s=171;''>Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage.</span>
<span sid='10071' title='10071; s=172;''>The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Calcutta&t=h'>Calcutta</a>, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he established a large practice.</span>
<span sid='10072' title='10072; s=173;''>In a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence.</span>
<span sid='10073' title='10073; s=174;''>As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> a morose and disappointed man."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10074' title='10074'>"When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bengal&t=h'>Bengal</a> Artillery.</span>
<span sid='10075' title='10075; s=176;''>My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my mother's re-marriage.</span>
<span sid='10076' title='10076; s=177;''>She had a considerable sum of money--not less than 1000 pounds a year--and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage.</span>
<span sid='10077' title='10077; s=178;''>Shortly after our return to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> my mother died--she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Crewe&t=h'>Crewe</a>.</span>
<span sid='10078' title='10078; s=179;''>Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran.</span>
<span sid='10079' title='10079; s=180;''>The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10080' title='10080'>"But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time.</span>
<span sid='10081' title='10081; s=182;''>Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path.</span>
<span sid='10082' title='10082; s=183;''>Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my stepfather's case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence in the tropics.</span>
<span sid='10083' title='10083; s=184;''>A series of disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10084' title='10084'>"Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure.</span>
<span sid='10085' title='10085; s=186;''>He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end.</span>
<span sid='10086' title='10086; s=187;''>He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10087' title='10087'>"You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no great pleasure in our lives.</span>
<span sid='10088' title='10088; s=189;''>No servant would stay with us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house.</span>
<span sid='10089' title='10089; s=190;''>She was but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10090' title='10090'>"Your sister is dead, then?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10091' title='10091'>"She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to speak to you.</span>
<span sid='10092' title='10092; s=193;''>You can understand that, living the life which I have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position.</span>
<span sid='10093' title='10093; s=194;''>We had, however, an aunt, my mother's maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Harrow&t=h'>Harrow</a>, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady's house.</span>
<span sid='10094' title='10094; s=195;''>Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged.</span>
<span sid='10095' title='10095; s=196;''>My stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10096' title='10096'>Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10097' title='10097'>"Pray be precise as to details," said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10098' title='10098'>"It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory.</span>
<span sid='10099' title='10099; s=200;''>The manor-house is, as I have already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited.</span>
<span sid='10100' title='10100; s=201;''>The bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings.</span>
<span sid='10101' title='10101; s=202;''>Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott's, the second my sister's, and the third my own.</span>
<span sid='10102' title='10102; s=203;''>There is no communication between them, but they all open out into the same corridor.</span>
<span sid='10103' title='10103; s=204;''>Do I make myself plain?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10104' title='10104'>"Perfectly so."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10105' title='10105'>"The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn.</span>
<span sid='10106' title='10106; s=207;''>That fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke.</span>
<span sid='10107' title='10107; s=208;''>She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding.</span>
<span sid='10108' title='10108; s=209;''>At eleven o'clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10109' title='10109'>"'Tell me, Helen,' said she, 'have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='10110' title='10110'>"'Never,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10111' title='10111'>"'I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='10112' title='10112'>"'Certainly not.</span>
<span sid='10113' title='10113; s=214;''>But why?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='10114' title='10114'>"'Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle.</span>
<span sid='10115' title='10115; s=216;''>I am a light sleeper, and it has awakened me.</span>
<span sid='10116' title='10116; s=217;''>I cannot tell where it came from--perhaps from the next room, perhaps from the lawn.</span>
<span sid='10117' title='10117; s=218;''>I thought that I would just ask you whether you had heard it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='10118' title='10118'>"'No, I have not.</span>
<span sid='10119' title='10119; s=220;''>It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='10120' title='10120'>"'Very likely.</span>
<span sid='10121' title='10121; s=222;''>And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did not hear it also.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='10122' title='10122'>"'Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='10123' title='10123'>"'Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.'</span>
<span sid='10124' title='10124; s=225;''>She smiled back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10125' title='10125'>"Indeed," said Holmes.</span>
<span sid='10126' title='10126; s=227;''>"Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10127' title='10127'>"Always."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10128' title='10128'>"And why?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10129' title='10129'>"I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon.</span>
<span sid='10130' title='10130; s=231;''>We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10131' title='10131'>"Quite so.</span>
<span sid='10132' title='10132; s=233;''>Pray proceed with your statement."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10133' title='10133'>"I could not sleep that night.</span>
<span sid='10134' title='10134; s=235;''>A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me.</span>
<span sid='10135' title='10135; s=236;''>My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied.</span>
<span sid='10136' title='10136; s=237;''>It was a wild night.</span>
<span sid='10137' title='10137; s=238;''>The wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows.</span>
<span sid='10138' title='10138; s=239;''>Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman.</span>
<span sid='10139' title='10139; s=240;''>I knew that it was my sister's voice.</span>
<span sid='10140' title='10140; s=241;''>I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor.</span>
<span sid='10141' title='10141; s=242;''>As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen.</span>
<span sid='10142' title='10142; s=243;''>As I ran down the passage, my sister's door was unlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges.</span>
<span sid='10143' title='10143; s=244;''>I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it.</span>
<span sid='10144' title='10144; s=245;''>By the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard.</span>
<span sid='10145' title='10145; s=246;''>I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground.</span>
<span sid='10146' title='10146; s=247;''>She writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed.</span>
<span sid='10147' title='10147; s=248;''>At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget, 'Oh, my God!</span>
<span sid='10148' title='10148; s=249;''>Helen!</span>
<span sid='10149' title='10149; s=250;''>It was the band!</span>
<span sid='10150' title='10150; s=251;''>The speckled band!'</span>
<span sid='10151' title='10151; s=252;''>There was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor's room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words.</span>
<span sid='10152' title='10152; s=253;''>I rushed out, calling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown.</span>
<span sid='10153' title='10153; s=254;''>When he reached my sister's side she was unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness.</span>
<span sid='10154' title='10154; s=255;''>Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10155' title='10155'>"One moment," said Holmes, "are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound?</span>
<span sid='10156' title='10156; s=257;''>Could you swear to it?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10157' title='10157'>"That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry.</span>
<span sid='10158' title='10158; s=259;''>It is my strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10159' title='10159'>"Was your sister dressed?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10160' title='10160'>"No, she was in her night-dress.</span>
<span sid='10161' title='10161; s=262;''>In her right hand was found the charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10162' title='10162'>"Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place.</span>
<span sid='10163' title='10163; s=264;''>That is important.</span>
<span sid='10164' title='10164; s=265;''>And what conclusions did the coroner come to?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10165' title='10165'>"He investigated the case with great care, for Dr.  Roylott's conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death.</span>
<span sid='10166' title='10166; s=267;''>My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every night.</span>
<span sid='10167' title='10167; s=268;''>The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with the same result.</span>
<span sid='10168' title='10168; s=269;''>The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large staples.</span>
<span sid='10169' title='10169; s=270;''>It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end.</span>
<span sid='10170' title='10170; s=271;''>Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10171' title='10171'>"How about poison?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10172' title='10172'>"The doctors examined her for it, but without success."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10173' title='10173'>"What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10174' title='10174'>"It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10175' title='10175'>"Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10176' title='10176'>"Yes, there are nearly always some there."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10177' title='10177'>"Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band--a speckled band?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10178' title='10178'>"Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation.</span>
<span sid='10179' title='10179; s=280;''>I do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10180' title='10180'>Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10181' title='10181'>"These are very deep waters," said he, "pray go on with your narrative."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10182' title='10182'>"Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever.</span>
<span sid='10183' title='10183; s=284;''>A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage.</span>
<span sid='10184' title='10184; s=285;''>His name is Armitage--Percy Armitage--the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Reading&t=h'>Reading</a>.</span>
<span sid='10185' title='10185; s=286;''>My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring.</span>
<span sid='10186' title='10186; s=287;''>Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept.</span>
<span sid='10187' title='10187; s=288;''>Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death.</span>
<span sid='10188' title='10188; s=289;''>I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room.</span>
<span sid='10189' title='10189; s=290;''>I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Leatherhead&t=h'>Leatherhead</a>, from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10190' title='10190'>"You have done wisely," said my friend.</span>
<span sid='10191' title='10191; s=292;''>"But have you told me all?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10192' title='10192'>"Yes, all."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10193' title='10193'>"Miss Roylott, you have not.</span>
<span sid='10194' title='10194; s=295;''>You are screening your stepfather."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10195' title='10195'>"Why, what do you mean?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10196' title='10196'>For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor's knee.</span>
<span sid='10197' title='10197; s=298;''>Five little livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10198' title='10198'>"You have been cruelly used," said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10199' title='10199'>The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist.</span>
<span sid='10200' title='10200; s=301;''>"He is a hard man," she said, "and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10201' title='10201'>There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10202' title='10202'>"This is a very deep business," he said at last.</span>
<span sid='10203' title='10203; s=304;''>"There are a thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action.</span>
<span sid='10204' title='10204; s=305;''>Yet we have not a moment to lose.</span>
<span sid='10205' title='10205; s=306;''>If we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10206' title='10206'>"As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business.</span>
<span sid='10207' title='10207; s=308;''>It is probable that he will be away all day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you.</span>
<span sid='10208' title='10208; s=309;''>We have a housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10209' title='10209'>"Excellent.</span>
<span sid='10210' title='10210; s=311;''>You are not averse to this trip, Watson?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10211' title='10211'>"By no means."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10212' title='10212'>"Then we shall both come.</span>
<span sid='10213' title='10213; s=314;''>What are you going to do yourself?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10214' title='10214'>"I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town.</span>
<span sid='10215' title='10215; s=316;''>But I shall return by the twelve o'clock train, so as to be there in time for your coming."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10216' title='10216'>"And you may expect us early in the afternoon.</span>
<span sid='10217' title='10217; s=318;''>I have myself some small business matters to attend to.</span>
<span sid='10218' title='10218; s=319;''>Will you not wait and breakfast?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10219' title='10219'>"No, I must go.</span>
<span sid='10220' title='10220; s=321;''>My heart is lightened already since I have confided my trouble to you.</span>
<span sid='10221' title='10221; s=322;''>I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon."</span>
<span sid='10222' title='10222; s=323;''>She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10223' title='10223'>"And what do you think of it all, Watson?" asked Sherlock Holmes, leaning back in his chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10224' title='10224'>"It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10225' title='10225'>"Dark enough and sinister enough."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10226' title='10226'>"Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10227' title='10227'>"What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10228' title='10228'>"I cannot think."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10229' title='10229'>"When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter's marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10230' title='10230'>"But what, then, did the gipsies do?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10231' title='10231'>"I cannot imagine."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10232' title='10232'>"I see many objections to any such theory."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10233' title='10233'>"And so do I.</span>
<span sid='10234' title='10234; s=335;''>It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day.</span>
<span sid='10235' title='10235; s=336;''>I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away.</span>
<span sid='10236' title='10236; s=337;''>But what in the name of the devil!"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10237' title='10237'>The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture.</span>
<span sid='10238' title='10238; s=339;''>His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand.</span>
<span sid='10239' title='10239; s=340;''>So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side.</span>
<span sid='10240' title='10240; s=341;''>A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10241' title='10241'>"Which of you is Holmes?" asked this apparition.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10242' title='10242'>"My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me," said my companion quietly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10243' title='10243'>"I am Dr.  Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10244' title='10244'>"Indeed, Doctor," said Holmes blandly.</span>
<span sid='10245' title='10245; s=346;''>"Pray take a seat."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10246' title='10246'>"I will do nothing of the kind.</span>
<span sid='10247' title='10247; s=348;''>My stepdaughter has been here.</span>
<span sid='10248' title='10248; s=349;''>I have traced her.</span>
<span sid='10249' title='10249; s=350;''>What has she been saying to you?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10250' title='10250'>"It is a little cold for the time of the year," said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10251' title='10251'>"What has she been saying to you?" screamed the old man furiously.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10252' title='10252'>"But I have heard that the crocuses promise well," continued my companion imperturbably.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10253' title='10253'>"Ha!</span>
<span sid='10254' title='10254; s=355;''>You put me off, do you?" said our new visitor, taking a step forward and shaking his hunting-crop.</span>
<span sid='10255' title='10255; s=356;''>"I know you, you scoundrel!</span>
<span sid='10256' title='10256; s=357;''>I have heard of you before.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10257' title='10257'>My friend smiled.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10258' title='10258'>"Holmes, the busybody!"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10259' title='10259'>His smile broadened.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10260' title='10260'>"Holmes, the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a> Jack-in-office!"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10261' title='10261'>Holmes chuckled heartily.</span>
<span sid='10262' title='10262; s=364;''>"Your conversation is most entertaining," said he.</span>
<span sid='10263' title='10263; s=365;''>"When you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10264' title='10264'>"I will go when I have said my say.</span>
<span sid='10265' title='10265; s=367;''>Don't you dare to meddle with my affairs.</span>
<span sid='10266' title='10266; s=368;''>I know that Miss Stoner has been here.</span>
<span sid='10267' title='10267; s=369;''>I traced her!</span>
<span sid='10268' title='10268; s=370;''>I am a dangerous man to fall foul of!</span>
<span sid='10269' title='10269; s=371;''>See here."</span>
<span sid='10270' title='10270; s=372;''>He stepped swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10271' title='10271'>"See that you keep yourself out of my grip," he snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10272' title='10272'>"He seems a very amiable person," said Holmes, laughing.</span>
<span sid='10273' title='10273; s=375;''>"I am not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own."</span>
<span sid='10274' title='10274; s=376;''>As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10275' title='10275'>"Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force!</span>
<span sid='10276' title='10276; s=378;''>This incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her.</span>
<span sid='10277' title='10277; s=379;''>And now, Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Doctors' Commons&t=h'>Doctors' Commons</a>, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this matter."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10278' title='10278'>It was nearly one o'clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion.</span>
<span sid='10279' title='10279; s=381;''>He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10280' title='10280'>"I have seen the will of the deceased wife," said he.</span>
<span sid='10281' title='10281; s=383;''>"To determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned.</span>
<span sid='10282' title='10282; s=384;''>The total income, which at the time of the wife's death was little short of 1100 pounds, is now, through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than 750 pounds.</span>
<span sid='10283' title='10283; s=385;''>Each daughter can claim an income of 250 pounds, in case of marriage.</span>
<span sid='10284' title='10284; s=386;''>It is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent.</span>
<span sid='10285' title='10285; s=387;''>My morning's work has not been wasted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort.</span>
<span sid='10286' title='10286; s=388;''>And now, Watson, this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo.</span>
<span sid='10287' title='10287; s=389;''>I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket.</span>
<span sid='10288' title='10288; s=390;''>An Eley's No.2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots.</span>
<span sid='10289' title='10289; s=391;''>That and a tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10290' title='10290'>At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Leatherhead&t=h'>Leatherhead</a>, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Surrey&t=h'>Surrey</a> lanes.</span>
<span sid='10291' title='10291; s=393;''>It was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens.</span>
<span sid='10292' title='10292; s=394;''>The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth.</span>
<span sid='10293' title='10293; s=395;''>To me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged.</span>
<span sid='10294' title='10294; s=396;''>My companion sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought.</span>
<span sid='10295' title='10295; s=397;''>Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10296' title='10296'>"Look there!" said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10297' title='10297'>A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove at the highest point.</span>
<span sid='10298' title='10298; s=400;''>From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10299' title='10299'>"Stoke Moran?" said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10300' title='10300'>"Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr.  Grimesby Roylott," remarked the driver.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10301' title='10301'>"There is some building going on there," said Holmes, "that is where we are going."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10302' title='10302'>"There's the village," said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left; "but if you want to get to the house, you'll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the foot-path over the fields.</span>
<span sid='10303' title='10303; s=405;''>There it is, where the lady is walking."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10304' title='10304'>"And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner," observed Holmes, shading his eyes.</span>
<span sid='10305' title='10305; s=407;''>"Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10306' title='10306'>We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Leatherhead&t=h'>Leatherhead</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10307' title='10307'>"I thought it as well," said Holmes as we climbed the stile, "that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business.</span>
<span sid='10308' title='10308; s=410;''>It may stop his gossip.</span>
<span sid='10309' title='10309; s=411;''>Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner.</span>
<span sid='10310' title='10310; s=412;''>You see that we have been as good as our word."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10311' title='10311'>Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy.</span>
<span sid='10312' title='10312; s=414;''>"I have been waiting so eagerly for you," she cried, shaking hands with us warmly.</span>
<span sid='10313' title='10313; s=415;''>"All has turned out splendidly.</span>
<span sid='10314' title='10314; s=416;''>Dr.  Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10315' title='10315'>"We have had the pleasure of making the doctor's acquaintance," said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred.</span>
<span sid='10316' title='10316; s=418;''>Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10317' title='10317'>"Good heavens!" she cried, "he has followed me, then."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10318' title='10318'>"So it appears."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10319' title='10319'>"He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him.</span>
<span sid='10320' title='10320; s=422;''>What will he say when he returns?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10321' title='10321'>"He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track.</span>
<span sid='10322' title='10322; s=424;''>You must lock yourself up from him to-night.</span>
<span sid='10323' title='10323; s=425;''>If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt's at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Harrow&t=h'>Harrow</a>.</span>
<span sid='10324' title='10324; s=426;''>Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10325' title='10325'>The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side.</span>
<span sid='10326' title='10326; s=428;''>In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin.</span>
<span sid='10327' title='10327; s=429;''>The central portion was in little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided.</span>
<span sid='10328' title='10328; s=430;''>Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit.</span>
<span sid='10329' title='10329; s=431;''>Holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10330' title='10330'>"This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one to your sister's, and the one next to the main building to Dr.  Roylott's chamber?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10331' title='10331'>"Exactly so.</span>
<span sid='10332' title='10332; s=434;''>But I am now sleeping in the middle one."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10333' title='10333'>"Pending the alterations, as I understand.</span>
<span sid='10334' title='10334; s=436;''>By the way, there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10335' title='10335'>"There were none.</span>
<span sid='10336' title='10336; s=438;''>I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10337' title='10337'>"Ah!</span>
<span sid='10338' title='10338; s=440;''>That is suggestive.</span>
<span sid='10339' title='10339; s=441;''>Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open.</span>
<span sid='10340' title='10340; s=442;''>There are windows in it, of course?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10341' title='10341'>"Yes, but very small ones.</span>
<span sid='10342' title='10342; s=444;''>Too narrow for anyone to pass through."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10343' title='10343'>"As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side.</span>
<span sid='10344' title='10344; s=446;''>Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10345' title='10345'>Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but without success.</span>
<span sid='10346' title='10346; s=448;''>There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar.</span>
<span sid='10347' title='10347; s=449;''>Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry.</span>
<span sid='10348' title='10348; s=450;''>"Hum!" said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, "my theory certainly presents some difficulties.</span>
<span sid='10349' title='10349; s=451;''>No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted.</span>
<span sid='10350' title='10350; s=452;''>Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10351' title='10351'>A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened.</span>
<span sid='10352' title='10352; s=454;''>Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate.</span>
<span sid='10353' title='10353; s=455;''>It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses.</span>
<span sid='10354' title='10354; s=456;''>A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window.</span>
<span sid='10355' title='10355; s=457;''>These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre.</span>
<span sid='10356' title='10356; s=458;''>The boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house.</span>
<span sid='10357' title='10357; s=459;''>Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10358' title='10358'>"Where does that bell communicate with?" he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying upon the pillow.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10359' title='10359'>"It goes to the housekeeper's room."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10360' title='10360'>"It looks newer than the other things?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10361' title='10361'>"Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10362' title='10362'>"Your sister asked for it, I suppose?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10363' title='10363'>"No, I never heard of her using it.</span>
<span sid='10364' title='10364; s=466;''>We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10365' title='10365'>"Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there.</span>
<span sid='10366' title='10366; s=468;''>You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor."</span>
<span sid='10367' title='10367; s=469;''>He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards.</span>
<span sid='10368' title='10368; s=470;''>Then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled.</span>
<span sid='10369' title='10369; s=471;''>Finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall.</span>
<span sid='10370' title='10370; s=472;''>Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10371' title='10371'>"Why, it's a dummy," said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10372' title='10372'>"Won't it ring?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10373' title='10373'>"No, it is not even attached to a wire.</span>
<span sid='10374' title='10374; s=476;''>This is very interesting.</span>
<span sid='10375' title='10375; s=477;''>You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10376' title='10376'>"How very absurd!</span>
<span sid='10377' title='10377; s=479;''>I never noticed that before."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10378' title='10378'>"Very strange!" muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope.</span>
<span sid='10379' title='10379; s=481;''>"There are one or two very singular points about this room.</span>
<span sid='10380' title='10380; s=482;''>For example, what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10381' title='10381'>"That is also quite modern," said the lady.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10382' title='10382'>"Done about the same time as the bell-rope?" remarked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10383' title='10383'>"Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10384' title='10384'>"They seem to have been of a most interesting character--dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate.</span>
<span sid='10385' title='10385; s=487;''>With your permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10386' title='10386'>Dr.  Grimesby Roylott's chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished.</span>
<span sid='10387' title='10387; s=489;''>A camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye.</span>
<span sid='10388' title='10388; s=490;''>Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10389' title='10389'>"What's in here?" he asked, tapping the safe.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10390' title='10390'>"My stepfather's business papers."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10391' title='10391'>"Oh!</span>
<span sid='10392' title='10392; s=494; 
Capitalization of "You".''>You have seen inside, then?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10393' title='10393'>"Only once, some years ago.</span>
<span sid='10394' title='10394; s=496;''>I remember that it was full of papers."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10395' title='10395'>"There isn't a cat in it, for example?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10396' title='10396'>"No.</span>
<span sid='10397' title='10397; s=499;''>What a strange idea!"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10398' title='10398'>"Well, look at this!"</span>
<span sid='10399' title='10399; s=501;''>He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10400' title='10400'>"No, we don't keep a cat.</span>
<span sid='10401' title='10401; s=503;''>But there is a cheetah and a baboon."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10402' title='10402'>"Ah, yes, of course!</span>
<span sid='10403' title='10403; s=505;''>Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay.</span>
<span sid='10404' title='10404; s=506;''>There is one point which I should wish to determine."</span>
<span sid='10405' title='10405; s=507;''>He squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10406' title='10406'>"Thank you.</span>
<span sid='10407' title='10407; s=509;''>That is quite settled," said he, rising and putting his lens in his pocket.</span>
<span sid='10408' title='10408; s=510;''>"Hullo!</span>
<span sid='10409' title='10409; s=511;''>Here is something interesting!"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10410' title='10410'>The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed.</span>
<span sid='10411' title='10411; s=513;''>The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10412' title='10412'>"What do you make of that, Watson?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10413' title='10413'>"It's a common enough lash.</span>
<span sid='10414' title='10414; s=516;''>But I don't know why it should be tied."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10415' title='10415'>"That is not quite so common, is it?</span>
<span sid='10416' title='10416; s=518;''>Ah, me!</span>
<span sid='10417' title='10417; s=519;''>It's a wicked world, and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all.</span>
<span sid='10418' title='10418; s=520;''>I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10419' title='10419'>I had never seen my friend's face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation.</span>
<span sid='10420' title='10420; s=522;''>We had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10421' title='10421'>"It is very essential, Miss Stoner," said he, "that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10422' title='10422'>"I shall most certainly do so."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10423' title='10423'>"The matter is too serious for any hesitation.</span>
<span sid='10424' title='10424; s=526;''>Your life may depend upon your compliance."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10425' title='10425'>"I assure you that I am in your hands."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10426' title='10426'>"In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your room."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10427' title='10427'>Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10428' title='10428'>"Yes, it must be so.</span>
<span sid='10429' title='10429; s=531;''>Let me explain.</span>
<span sid='10430' title='10430; s=532;''>I believe that that is the village inn over there?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10431' title='10431'>"Yes, that is the Crown."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10432' title='10432'>"Very good.</span>
<span sid='10433' title='10433; s=535;''>Your windows would be visible from there?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10434' title='10434'>"Certainly."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10435' title='10435'>"You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when your stepfather comes back.</span>
<span sid='10436' title='10436; s=538;''>Then when you hear him retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy.</span>
<span sid='10437' title='10437; s=539;''>I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10438' title='10438'>"Oh, yes, easily."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10439' title='10439'>"The rest you will leave in our hands."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10440' title='10440'>"But what will you do?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10441' title='10441'>"We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10442' title='10442'>"I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind," said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion's sleeve.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10443' title='10443'>"Perhaps I have."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10444' title='10444'>"Then, for pity's sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister's death."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10445' title='10445'>"I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10446' title='10446'>"You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she died from some sudden fright."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10447' title='10447'>"No, I do not think so.</span>
<span sid='10448' title='10448; s=550;''>I think that there was probably some more tangible cause.</span>
<span sid='10449' title='10449; s=551;''>And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr.  Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain.</span>
<span sid='10450' title='10450; s=552;''>Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10451' title='10451'>Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the Crown Inn.</span>
<span sid='10452' title='10452; s=554;''>They were on the upper floor, and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House.</span>
<span sid='10453' title='10453; s=555;''>At dusk we saw Dr.  Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him.</span>
<span sid='10454' title='10454; s=556;''>The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor's voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him.</span>
<span sid='10455' title='10455; s=557;''>The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10456' title='10456'>"Do you know, Watson," said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness, "I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night.</span>
<span sid='10457' title='10457; s=559;''>There is a distinct element of danger."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10458' title='10458'>"Can I be of assistance?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10459' title='10459'>"Your presence might be invaluable."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10460' title='10460'>"Then I shall certainly come."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10461' title='10461'>"It is very kind of you."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10462' title='10462'>"You speak of danger.</span>
<span sid='10463' title='10463; s=565;''>You have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10464' title='10464'>"No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more.</span>
<span sid='10465' title='10465; s=567;''>I imagine that you saw all that I did."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10466' title='10466'>"I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10467' title='10467'>"You saw the ventilator, too?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10468' title='10468'>"Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms.</span>
<span sid='10469' title='10469; s=571;''>It was so small that a rat could hardly pass through."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10470' title='10470'>"I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10471' title='10471'>"My dear Holmes!"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10472' title='10472'>"Oh, yes, I did.</span>
<span sid='10473' title='10473; s=575;''>You remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell Dr.  Roylott's cigar.</span>
<span sid='10474' title='10474; s=576;''>Now, of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms.</span>
<span sid='10475' title='10475; s=577;''>It could only be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner's inquiry.</span>
<span sid='10476' title='10476; s=578;''>I deduced a ventilator."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10477' title='10477'>"But what harm can there be in that?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10478' title='10478'>"Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates.</span>
<span sid='10479' title='10479; s=581;''>A ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies.</span>
<span sid='10480' title='10480; s=582;''>Does not that strike you?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10481' title='10481'>"I cannot as yet see any connection."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10482' title='10482'>"Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10483' title='10483'>"No."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10484' title='10484'>"It was clamped to the floor.</span>
<span sid='10485' title='10485; s=587;''>Did you ever see a bed fastened like that before?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10486' title='10486'>"I cannot say that I have."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10487' title='10487'>"The lady could not move her bed.</span>
<span sid='10488' title='10488; s=590;''>It must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope--or so we may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10489' title='10489'>"Holmes," I cried, "I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at.</span>
<span sid='10490' title='10490; s=592;''>We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10491' title='10491'>"Subtle enough and horrible enough.</span>
<span sid='10492' title='10492; s=594;''>When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals.</span>
<span sid='10493' title='10493; s=595;''>He has nerve and he has knowledge.</span>
<span sid='10494' title='10494; s=596;''>Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession.</span>
<span sid='10495' title='10495; s=597;''>This man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still.</span>
<span sid='10496' title='10496; s=598;''>But we shall have horrors enough before the night is over; for goodness' sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10497' title='10497'>About nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House.</span>
<span sid='10498' title='10498; s=600;''>Two hours passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10499' title='10499'>"That is our signal," said Holmes, springing to his feet; "it comes from the middle window."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10500' title='10500'>As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that we might spend the night there.</span>
<span sid='10501' title='10501; s=603;''>A moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10502' title='10502'>There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall.</span>
<span sid='10503' title='10503; s=605;''>Making our way among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10504' title='10504'>"My God!" I whispered; "did you see it?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10505' title='10505'>Holmes was for the moment as startled as I.</span>
<span sid='10506' title='10506; s=608;''>His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation.</span>
<span sid='10507' title='10507; s=609;''>Then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10508' title='10508'>"It is a nice household," he murmured.</span>
<span sid='10509' title='10509; s=611;''>"That is the baboon."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10510' title='10510'>I had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected.</span>
<span sid='10511' title='10511; s=613;''>There was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment.</span>
<span sid='10512' title='10512; s=614;''>I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes' example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom.</span>
<span sid='10513' title='10513; s=615;''>My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room.</span>
<span sid='10514' title='10514; s=616;''>All was as we had seen it in the daytime.</span>
<span sid='10515' title='10515; s=617;new paragraph? colon not seperated''>Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words:  "The least sound would be fatal to our plans."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10516' title='10516'>I nodded to show that I had heard.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10517' title='10517'>"We must sit without light.</span>
<span sid='10518' title='10518; s=620;''>He would see it through the ventilator."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10519' title='10519'>I nodded again.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10520' title='10520'>"Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it.</span>
<span sid='10521' title='10521; s=623;''>Have your pistol ready in case we should need it.</span>
<span sid='10522' title='10522; s=624;''>I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in that chair."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10523' title='10523'>I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10524' title='10524'>Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed beside him.</span>
<span sid='10525' title='10525; s=627;''>By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle.</span>
<span sid='10526' title='10526; s=628;''>Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10527' title='10527'>How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil?</span>
<span sid='10528' title='10528; s=630;''>I could not hear a sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which I was myself.</span>
<span sid='10529' title='10529; s=631;''>The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.</span>
<span sid='10530' title='10530; s=632;''>From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty.</span>
<span sid='10531' title='10531; s=633;''>Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour.</span>
<span sid='10532' title='10532; s=634;''>How long they seemed, those quarters!</span>
<span sid='10533' title='10533; s=635;''>Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10534' title='10534'>Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal.</span>
<span sid='10535' title='10535; s=637;''>Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern.</span>
<span sid='10536' title='10536; s=638;''>I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger.</span>
<span sid='10537' title='10537; s=639;''>For half an hour I sat with straining ears.</span>
<span sid='10538' title='10538; s=640;''>Then suddenly another sound became audible--a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle.</span>
<span sid='10539' title='10539; s=641;''>The instant that we heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10540' title='10540'>"You see it, Watson?" he yelled.</span>
<span sid='10541' title='10541; s=643;''>"You see it?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='10542' title='10542'>But I saw nothing.</span>
<span sid='10543' title='10543; s=645;''>At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely.</span>
<span sid='10544' title='10544; s=646;''>I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10545' title='10545'>He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened.</span>
<span sid='10546' title='10546; s=648;''>It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek.</span>
<span sid='10547' title='10547; s=649;''>They say that away down in the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds.</span>
<span sid='10548' title='10548; s=650;''>It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10549' title='10549'>"What can it mean?" I gasped.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10550' title='10550'>"It means that it is all over," Holmes answered.</span>
<span sid='10551' title='10551; s=653;''>"And perhaps, after all, it is for the best.</span>
<span sid='10552' title='10552; s=654;''>Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr.  Roylott's room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10553' title='10553'>"With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor.</span>
<span sid='10554' title='10554; s=656;''>Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within.</span>
<span sid='10555' title='10555; s=657;''>Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10556' title='10556'>It was a singular sight which met our eyes.</span>
<span sid='10557' title='10557; s=659;''>On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar.</span>
<span sid='10558' title='10558; s=661;''>Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr.  Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers.</span>
<span sid='10559' title='10559; s=662;''>Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day.</span>
<span sid='10560' title='10560; s=663;''>His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling.</span>
<span sid='10561' title='10561; s=664;''>Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his head.</span>
<span sid='10562' title='10562; s=665;''>As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10563' title='10563'>"The band!</span>
<span sid='10564' title='10564; s=667;''>The speckled band!" whispered Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10565' title='10565'>I took a step forward.</span>
<span sid='10566' title='10566; s=669;''>In an instant his strange headgear began to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10567' title='10567'>"It is a swamp adder!" cried Holmes; "the deadliest snake in India.</span>
<span sid='10568' title='10568; s=671;''>He has died within ten seconds of being bitten.</span>
<span sid='10569' title='10569; s=672;''>Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another.</span>
<span sid='10570' title='10570; s=673;''>Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10571' title='10571'>As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man's lap, and throwing the noose round the reptile's neck he drew it from its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm's length, threw it into the iron safe, which he closed upon it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10572' title='10572'>Such are the true facts of the death of Dr.  Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.</span>
<span sid='10573' title='10573; s=676;''>It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Harrow&t=h'>Harrow</a>, of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet.</span>
<span sid='10574' title='10574; s=677;''>The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10575' title='10575'>"I had," said he, "come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data.</span>
<span sid='10576' title='10576; s=679;''>The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word 'band', which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent.</span>
<span sid='10577' title='10577; s=680;''>I can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door.</span>
<span sid='10578' title='10578; s=681;''>My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed.</span>
<span sid='10579' title='10579; s=682;''>The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed.</span>
<span sid='10580' title='10580; s=683;''>The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track.</span>
<span sid='10581' title='10581; s=684;''>The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training.</span>
<span sid='10582' title='10582; s=685;''>The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be an advantage.</span>
<span sid='10583' title='10583; s=686;''>It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work.</span>
<span sid='10584' title='10584; s=687;''>Then I thought of the whistle.</span>
<span sid='10585' title='10585; s=688;''>Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim.</span>
<span sid='10586' title='10586; s=689;''>He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned.</span>
<span sid='10587' title='10587; s=690;''>He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed.</span>
<span sid='10588' title='10588; s=691;''>It might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.</span>
<p>
<span sid='10589' title='10589'>"I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room.</span>
<span sid='10590' title='10590; s=693;''>An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator.</span>
<span sid='10591' title='10591; s=694;''>The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained.</span>
<span sid='10592' title='10592; s=695;''>The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant.</span>
<span sid='10593' title='10593; s=696;''>Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof.</span>
<span sid='10594' title='10594; s=697;''>I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10595' title='10595'>"With the result of driving it through the ventilator."</span>
<p>
<span sid='10596' title='10596'>"And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side.</span>
<span sid='10597' title='10597; s=700;''>Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw.</span>
<span sid='10598' title='10598; s=701;''>In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr.  Grimesby Roylott's death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience."</span>
