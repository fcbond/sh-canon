<p>
<span sid='36563' title='36563'>One summer night, a few months after my marriage, I was seated by my own hearth smoking a last pipe and nodding over a novel, for my day's work had been an exhausting one. </span>
<span sid='36564' title='36564'>My wife had already gone up stairs, and the sound of the locking of the hall door some time before told me that the servants had also retired. </span>
<span sid='36565' title='36565'>I had risen from my seat and was knocking out the ashes of my pipe, when I suddenly heard the clang of the bell.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36566' title='36566'>I looked at the clock. </span>
<span sid='36567' title='36567'>It was a quarter to twelve. </span>
<span sid='36568' title='36568'>This could not be a visitor at so late an hour. </span>
<span sid='36569' title='36569'>A patient, evidently, and possibly an all-night sitting. </span>
<span sid='36570' title='36570'>With a wry face I went out into the hall and opened the door. </span>
<span sid='36571' title='36571'>To my astonishment, it was Sherlock Holmes who stood upon my step.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36572' title='36572'>'Ah, Watson,' said he, 'I hoped that I might not be too late to catch you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36573' title='36573'>'My dear fellow, pray come in.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36574' title='36574'>'You look surprised, and no wonder! </span>
<span sid='36575' title='36575'>Relieved, too, I fancy! </span>
<span sid='36576' title='36576'>Hum! you still smoke the Arcadia mixture of your bachelor days, then! </span>
<span sid='36577' title='36577'>There's no mistaking that fluffy ash upon your coat. </span>
<span sid='36578' title='36578'>It's easy to tell that you've been accustomed to wear a uniform, Watson; you'll never pass as a purebred civilian as long as you keep that habit of carrying your handkerchief in your sleeve. </span>
<span sid='36579' title='36579'>Could you put me up to-night?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36580' title='36580'>'With pleasure.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36581' title='36581'>'You told me that you had bachelor quarters for one, and I see that you have no gentleman visitor at present. </span>
<span sid='36582' title='36582'>Your hat-stand proclaims as much.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36583' title='36583'>'I shall be delighted if you will stay.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36584' title='36584'>'Thank you. </span>
<span sid='36585' title='36585'>I'll fill a vacant peg, then. </span>
<span sid='36586' title='36586'>Sorry to see that you've had the British workman in the house. </span>
<span sid='36587' title='36587'>He's a token of evil. </span>
<span sid='36588' title='36588'>Not the drains, I hope?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36589' title='36589'>'No, the gas.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36590' title='36590'>'Ah! </span>
<span sid='36591' title='36591'>He has left two nail marks from his boot upon your linoleum just where the light strikes it. </span>
<span sid='36592' title='36592'>No, thank you, I had some supper at Waterloo, but I'll smoke a pipe with you with pleasure.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36593' title='36593'>I handed him my pouch, and he seated himself opposite to me, and smoked for some time in silence. </span>
<span sid='36594' title='36594'>I was well aware that nothing but business of importance could have brought him to me at such an hour, so I waited patiently until he should come round to it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36595' title='36595'>'I see that you are professionally rather busy just now,' said he, glancing very keenly across at me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36596' title='36596'>'Yes, I've had a busy day,' I answered. </span>
<span sid='36597' title='36597'>'It may seem very foolish in your eyes,' I added, 'but really I don't know how you deduced it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36598' title='36598'>Holmes chuckled to himself.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36599' title='36599'>'I have the advantage of knowing your habits, my dear Watson,' said he. </span>
<span sid='36600' title='36600'>'When your round is a short one you walk, and when it is a long one you use a hansom. </span>
<span sid='36601' title='36601'>As I perceive that your boots, although used, are by no means dirty, I cannot doubt that you are at present busy enough to justify the hansom.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36602' title='36602'>'Excellent!' I cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36603' title='36603'>'Elementary,' said he. </span>
<span sid='36604' title='36604'>'It is one of those instances where the reasoner can produce an effect which seems remarkable to his neighbour, because the latter has missed the one little point which is the basis of the deduction. </span>
<span sid='36605' title='36605'>The same may be said, my dear fellow, for the effect of some of these little sketches of yours, which is entirely meretricious, depending as it does upon your retaining in your own hands some factors in the problem which are never imparted to the reader. </span>
<span sid='36606' title='36606'>Now, at present I am in the position of these same readers, for I hold in this hand several threads of one of the strangest cases which ever perplexed a man's brain, and yet I lack the one or two which are needful to complete my theory. </span>
<span sid='36607' title='36607'>But I'll have them, Watson, I'll have them!' </span>
<span sid='36608' title='36608'>His eyes kindled and a slight flush sprang into his thin cheeks. </span>
<span sid='36609' title='36609'>For an instant the veil had lifted upon his keen, intense nature, but for an instant only. </span>
<span sid='36610' title='36610'>When I glanced again his face had resumed that Red Indian composure which had made so many regard him as a machine rather than a man.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36611' title='36611'>'The problem presents features of interest,' said he; 'I may even say very exceptional features of interest. </span>
<span sid='36612' title='36612'>I have already looked into the matter, and have come, as I think, within sight of my solution. </span>
<span sid='36613' title='36613'>If you could accompany me in that last step, you might be of considerable service to me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36614' title='36614'>'I should be delighted.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36615' title='36615'>'Could you go as far as <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Aldershot&t=h'>Aldershot</a> to-morrow?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36616' title='36616'>'I have no doubt Jackson would take my practice.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36617' title='36617'>'Very good. </span>
<span sid='36618' title='36618'>I want to start by the 11.10 from Waterloo.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36619' title='36619'>'That would give me time.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36620' title='36620'>'Then, if you are not too sleepy, I will give you a sketch of what has happened and of what remains to be done.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36621' title='36621'>'I was sleepy before you came. </span>
<span sid='36622' title='36622'>I am quite wakeful now.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36623' title='36623'>'I will compress the story as far as may be done without omitting anything vital to the case. </span>
<span sid='36624' title='36624'>It is conceivable that you may even have read some account of the matter. </span>
<span sid='36625' title='36625'>It is the supposed murder of Colonel Barclay, of the Royal Mallows, at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Aldershot&t=h'>Aldershot</a>, which I am investigating.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36626' title='36626'>'I have heard nothing of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36627' title='36627'>'It has not excited much attention yet, except locally. </span>
<span sid='36628' title='36628'>The facts are only two days old. </span>
<span sid='36629' title='36629'>Briefly they are these:</span>
<p>
<span sid='36630' title='36630'>'The Royal Mallows is, as you know, one of the most famous Irish regiments in the British Army. </span>
<span sid='36631' title='36631'>It did wonders both in the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Crimea&t=h'>Crimea</a> and the Mutiny, and has since that time distinguished itself upon every possible occasion. </span>
<span sid='36632' title='36632'>It was commanded up to Monday night by James Barclay, a gallant veteran, who started as a full private, was raised to commissioned rank for his bravery at the time of the Mutiny, and so lived to command the regiment in which he had once carried a musket.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36633' title='36633'>'Colonel Barclay had married at the time when he was a sergeant, and his wife, whose maiden name was Miss Nancy Devoy, was the daughter of a former colour-sergeant in the same corps. </span>
<span sid='36634' title='36634'>There was, therefore, as can be imagined, some little social friction when the young couple (for they were still young) found themselves in their new surroundings. </span>
<span sid='36635' title='36635'>They appear, however, to have quickly adapted themselves, and Mrs Barclay has always, I understand, been as popular with the ladies of the regiment as her husband was with his brother officers. </span>
<span sid='36636' title='36636'>I may add that she was a woman of great beauty, and that even now, when she has been married for upwards of thirty years, she is still of a striking appearance.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36637' title='36637'>'Colonel Barclay's family life appears to have been a uniformly happy one. </span>
<span sid='36638' title='36638'>Major Murphy, to whom I owe most of my facts, assures me that he has never heard of any misunderstanding between the pair. </span>
<span sid='36639' title='36639'>On the whole he thinks that Barclay's devotion to his wife was greater than his wife's to Barclay. </span>
<span sid='36640' title='36640'>He was acutely uneasy if he were absent from her for a day. </span>
<span sid='36641' title='36641'>She, on the other hand, though devoted and faithful, was less obtrusively affectionate. </span>
<span sid='36642' title='36642'>But they were regarded in the regiment as the very model of a middle-aged couple. </span>
<span sid='36643' title='36643'>There was absolutely nothing in their mutual relations to prepare people for the tragedy which was to follow.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36644' title='36644'>'Colonel Barclay himself seems to have had some singular traits in his character. </span>
<span sid='36645' title='36645'>He was a dashing, jovial old soldier in his usual mood, but there were occasions on which he seemed to show himself capable of considerable violence and vindictiveness. </span>
<span sid='36646' title='36646'>This side of his nature, however, appears never to have been turned towards his wife. </span>
<span sid='36647' title='36647'>Another fact which had struck Major Murphy, and three out of five of the other officers with whom I conversed, was the singular sort of depression which came upon him at times. </span>
<span sid='36648' title='36648'>As the Major expressed it, the smile had often been struck from his mouth, as if by some invisible hand, when he has been joining in the gaieties and chaff of the mess table. </span>
<span sid='36649' title='36649'>For days on end, when the mood was on him, he had been sunk in the deepest gloom. </span>
<span sid='36650' title='36650'>This and a certain tinge of superstition were the only unusual traits in his character which his brother officers had observed. </span>
<span sid='36651' title='36651'>The latter peculiarity took the form of a dislike to being left alone, especially after dark. </span>
<span sid='36652' title='36652'>This puerile feature in a nature which was conspicuously manly had often given rise to comment and conjecture.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36653' title='36653'>'The first battalion of the Royal Mallows (which is the old 117th) has been stationed at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Aldershot&t=h'>Aldershot</a> for some years. </span>
<span sid='36654' title='36654'>The married officers live out of barracks, and the Colonel has during all this time occupied a villa called Lachine, about half a mile from the North Camp. </span>
<span sid='36655' title='36655'>The house stands in its own grounds, but the west side of it is not more than thirty yards from the high road. </span>
<span sid='36656' title='36656'>A coachman and two maids form the staff of servants. </span>
<span sid='36657' title='36657'>These, with their master and mistress, were the sole occupants of Lachine, for the Barclays had no children, nor was it usual for them to have resident visitors.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36658' title='36658'>'Now for the events at Lachine between nine and ten on the evening of last Monday.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36659' title='36659'>'Mrs Barclay was, it appears, a member of the Roman Catholic Church, and had interested herself very much in the establishment of the Guild of St George, which was formed in connection with the Watt Street Chapel for the purpose of supplying the poor with cast-off clothing. </span>
<span sid='36660' title='36660'>A meeting of the Guild had been held that evening at eight, and Mrs Barclay had hurried over her dinner in order to be present at it. </span>
<span sid='36661' title='36661'>When leaving the house, she was heard by the coachman to make some commonplace remark to her husband, and to assure him that she would be back before long. </span>
<span sid='36662' title='36662'>She then called for Miss Morrison, a young lady who lives in the next villa, and the two went off together to their meeting. </span>
<span sid='36663' title='36663'>It lasted forty minutes, and at a quarter-past nine Mrs Barclay returned home, having left Miss Morrison at her door as she passed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36664' title='36664'>'There is a room which is used as a morning-room at Lachine. </span>
<span sid='36665' title='36665'>This faces the road, and opens by a large glass folding door on to the lawn. </span>
<span sid='36666' title='36666'>The lawn is thirty yards across, and is only divided from the highway by a low wall with an iron rail above it. </span>
<span sid='36667' title='36667'>It was into this room that Mrs Barclay went upon her return. </span>
<span sid='36668' title='36668'>The blinds were not down, for the room was seldom used in the evening, but Mrs Barclay herself lit the lamp and then rang the bell, asking Jane Stewart, the housemaid, to bring her a cup of tea, which was quite contrary to her usual habits. </span>
<span sid='36669' title='36669'>The Colonel had been sitting in the dining-room, but hearing that his wife had returned, he joined her in the morning-room. </span>
<span sid='36670' title='36670'>The coachman saw him cross the hall, and enter it. </span>
<span sid='36671' title='36671'>He was never seen again alive.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36672' title='36672'>'The tea which had been ordered was brought up at the end of ten minutes, but the maid, as she approached the door, was surprised to hear the voices of her master and mistress in furious altercation. </span>
<span sid='36673' title='36673'>She knocked without receiving any answer, and even turned the handle, but only to find that the door was locked upon the inside. </span>
<span sid='36674' title='36674'>Naturally enough, she ran down to tell the cook, and the two women with the coachman came up into the hall and listened to the dispute which was still raging. </span>
<span sid='36675' title='36675'>They all agree that only two voices were to be heard, those of Barclay and his wife. </span>
<span sid='36676' title='36676'>Barclay's remarks were subdued and abrupt, so that none of them were audible to the listeners. </span>
<span sid='36677' title='36677'>The lady's, on the other hand, were most bitter, and, when she raised her voice, could be plainly heard. </span>
<span sid='36678' title='36678'>"You coward!" she repeated over and over again. </span>
<span sid='36679' title='36679'>"What can be done now? </span>
<span sid='36680' title='36680'>Give me back my life. </span>
<span sid='36681' title='36681'>I will never so much as breathe the same air as you again! </span>
<span sid='36682' title='36682'>You coward! </span>
<span sid='36683' title='36683'>You coward!" </span>
<span sid='36684' title='36684'>Those were scraps of her conversation, ending in a sudden dreadful cry in the man's voice, with a crash, and a piercing scream from the woman. </span>
<span sid='36685' title='36685'>Convinced that some tragedy had occurred, the coachman rushed to the door and strove to force it, while scream after scream issued from within. </span>
<span sid='36686' title='36686'>He was unable, however, to make his way in, and the maids were too distracted with fear to be of any assistance to him. </span>
<span sid='36687' title='36687'>A sudden thought struck him, however, and he ran through the hall door and round to the lawn, upon which the long french windows opened. </span>
<span sid='36688' title='36688'>One side of the window was open, which I understand was quite usual in the summer-time, and he passed without difficulty into the room. </span>
<span sid='36689' title='36689'>His mistress had ceased to scream, and was stretched insensible upon a couch, while with his feet tilted over the side of an armchair, and his head upon the ground near the corner of the fender, was lying the unfortunate soldier, stone dead, in a pool of his own blood.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36690' title='36690'>'Naturally the coachman's first thought, on finding that he could do nothing for his master, was to open the door. </span>
<span sid='36691' title='36691'>But here an unexpected and singular difficulty presented itself. </span>
<span sid='36692' title='36692'>The key was not on the inner side of the door, nor could he find it anywhere in the room. </span>
<span sid='36693' title='36693'>He went out again, therefore, through the window, and having obtained the help of a policeman and of a medical man, he returned. </span>
<span sid='36694' title='36694'>The lady, against whom naturally the strongest suspicion rested, was removed to her room, still in a state of insensibility. </span>
<span sid='36695' title='36695'>The Colonel's body was then placed upon the sofa, and a careful examination made of the scene of the tragedy.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36696' title='36696'>'The injury from which the unfortunate veteran was suffering was found to be a ragged cut, some two inches long, at the back part of his head, which had evidently been caused by a violent blow from a blunt weapon. </span>
<span sid='36697' title='36697'>Nor was it difficult to guess what that weapon may have been. </span>
<span sid='36698' title='36698'>Upon the floor, close to the body, was lying a singular club of hard carved wood with a bone handle. </span>
<span sid='36699' title='36699'>The Colonel possessed a varied collection of weapons brought from the different countries in which he had fought, and it is conjectured by the police that this club was among his trophies. </span>
<span sid='36700' title='36700'>The servants deny having seen it before, but among the numerous curiosities in the house it is possible that it may have been overlooked. </span>
<span sid='36701' title='36701'>Nothing else of importance was discovered in the room by the police, save the inexplicable fact that neither upon Mrs Barclay's person, nor upon that of the victim, nor in any part of the room was the missing key to be found. </span>
<span sid='36702' title='36702'>The door had eventually to be opened by a locksmith from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Aldershot&t=h'>Aldershot</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36703' title='36703'>'That was the state of things, Watson, when upon the Tuesday morning I, at the request of Major Murphy, went down to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Aldershot&t=h'>Aldershot</a> to supplement the efforts of the police. </span>
<span sid='36704' title='36704'>I think you will acknowledge that the problem was already one of interest, but my observations soon made me realize that it was in truth much more extraordinary than would at first sight appear.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36705' title='36705'>'Before examining the room I cross-questioned the servants, but only succeeded in eliciting the facts which I have already stated. </span>
<span sid='36706' title='36706'>One other detail of interest was remembered by Jane Stewart, the housemaid. </span>
<span sid='36707' title='36707'>You will remember that on hearing the sound of the quarrel she descended and returned with the other servants. </span>
<span sid='36708' title='36708'>On that first occasion, when she was alone, she says that the voices of her master and mistress were sunk so low that she could hear hardly anything, and judged by their tones, rather than their words, that they had fallen out. </span>
<span sid='36709' title='36709'>On my pressing her, however, she remembered that she heard the word "David" uttered twice by the lady. </span>
<span sid='36710' title='36710'>The point is of the utmost importance as guiding us towards the reason of the sudden quarrel. </span>
<span sid='36711' title='36711'>The Colonel's name, you remember, was James.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36712' title='36712'>'There was one thing in the case which had made the deepest impression both upon the servants and the police. </span>
<span sid='36713' title='36713'>This was the contortion of the Colonel's face. </span>
<span sid='36714' title='36714'>It had set, according to their account, into the most dreadful expression of fear and horror which a human countenance is capable of assuming. </span>
<span sid='36715' title='36715'>More than one person fainted at the mere sight of him, so terrible was the effect. </span>
<span sid='36716' title='36716'>It was quite certain that he had foreseen his fate, and that it had caused him the utmost horror. </span>
<span sid='36717' title='36717'>This, of course, fitted in well enough with the police theory, if the Colonel could have seen his wife making a murderous attack upon him. </span>
<span sid='36718' title='36718'>Nor was the fact of the wound being on the back of his head a fatal objection to this, as he might have turned to avoid the blow. </span>
<span sid='36719' title='36719'>No information could be got from the lady herself, who was temporarily insane from an acute attack of brain fever.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36720' title='36720'>'From the police I learned that Miss Morrison, who, you remember, went out that evening with Mrs Barclay, denied having any knowledge of what it was which had caused the ill-humour in which her companion had returned.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36721' title='36721'>'Having gathered these facts, Watson, I smoked several pipes over them, trying to separate those which were crucial from others which were merely incidental. </span>
<span sid='36722' title='36722'>There could be no question that the most distinctive and suggestive point in the case was the singular disappearance of the door key. </span>
<span sid='36723' title='36723'>A most careful search had failed to discover it in the room. </span>
<span sid='36724' title='36724'>Therefore, it must have been taken from it. </span>
<span sid='36725' title='36725'>But neither the Colonel nor the Colonel's wife could have taken it. </span>
<span sid='36726' title='36726'>That was perfectly clear. </span>
<span sid='36727' title='36727'>Therefore a third person must have entered the room. </span>
<span sid='36728' title='36728'>And that third person could only have come in through the window. </span>
<span sid='36729' title='36729'>It seemed to me that a careful examination of the room and the lawn might possibly reveal some traces of this mysterious individual. </span>
<span sid='36730' title='36730'>You know my methods, Watson. </span>
<span sid='36731' title='36731'>There was not one of them which I did not apply to the inquiry. </span>
<span sid='36732' title='36732'>And it ended by my discovering traces, but very different ones from those which I had, expected. </span>
<span sid='36733' title='36733'>There had been a man in the room, and he had crossed the lawn coming from the road. </span>
<span sid='36734' title='36734'>I was able to obtain five very clear impressions of his footmarks - one on the roadway itself, at the point where he had climbed the low wall, two on the lawn, and two very faint ones upon the stained boards near the window where he had entered. </span>
<span sid='36735' title='36735'>He had apparently rushed across the lawn, for his toe marks were much deeper that his heels. </span>
<span sid='36736' title='36736'>But it was not the man who surprised me. </span>
<span sid='36737' title='36737'>It was his companion.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36738' title='36738'>'His companion!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36739' title='36739'>Holmes pulled a large sheet of tissue paper out of his pocket and carefully unfolded it upon his knee.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36740' title='36740'>'What do you make of that?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36741' title='36741'>The paper was covered with tracings of the footmarks of some small animal. </span>
<span sid='36742' title='36742'>It had five well-marked footpads, an indication of long nails, and the whole print might be nearly as large as a dessert spoon.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36743' title='36743'>'It's a dog,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36744' title='36744'>'Did you ever hear of a dog running up a curtain? </span>
<span sid='36745' title='36745'>I found distinct traces that this creature had done so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36746' title='36746'>'A monkey, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36747' title='36747'>'But it is not the print of a monkey.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36748' title='36748'>'What can it be, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36749' title='36749'>'Neither dog, nor cat, nor monkey, nor any creature that we are familiar with. </span>
<span sid='36750' title='36750'>I have tried to reconstruct it from the measurements. </span>
<span sid='36751' title='36751'>Here are four prints where the beast has been standing motionless. </span>
<span sid='36752' title='36752'>You see that it is no less than fifteen inches from fore foot to hind. </span>
<span sid='36753' title='36753'>Add to that the length of neck and head, and you get a creature not much less than two feet long - probably more if there is any tail. </span>
<span sid='36754' title='36754'>But now observe this other measurement. </span>
<span sid='36755' title='36755'>The animal has been moving, and we have the length of its stride. </span>
<span sid='36756' title='36756'>In each case it is only about three inches. </span>
<span sid='36757' title='36757'>You have an indication, you see, of a long body with very short legs attached to it. </span>
<span sid='36758' title='36758'>It has not been considerate enough to leave any of its hair behind it. </span>
<span sid='36759' title='36759'>But its general shape must be what I have indicated, and it can run up a curtain and is carnivorous.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36760' title='36760'>'How do you deduce that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36761' title='36761'>'Because it ran up the curtain. </span>
<span sid='36762' title='36762'>A canary's cage was hanging in the window, and its aim seems to have been to get at the bird.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36763' title='36763'>'Then what was the beast?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36764' title='36764'>'Ah, if I could give it a name it might go a long way towards solving the case. </span>
<span sid='36765' title='36765'>On the whole it was probably some creature of the weasel or stoat tribe - and yet it is larger than any of these that I have seen.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36766' title='36766'>'But what had it to do with the crime?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36767' title='36767'>'That also is still obscure. </span>
<span sid='36768' title='36768'>But we have learned a good deal, you perceive. </span>
<span sid='36769' title='36769'>We know that a man stood in the road looking at the quarrel between the Barclays - the blinds were up and the room lighted. </span>
<span sid='36770' title='36770'>We know also that he ran across the lawn, entered the room, accompanied by a strange animal, and that he either struck the Colonel, or, as is equally possible, that the Colonel fell down from sheer fright at the sight of him, and cut his head on the corner of the fender. </span>
<span sid='36771' title='36771'>Finally, we have the curious fact that the intruder carried away the key with him when he left.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36772' title='36772'>'Your discoveries seem to have left the business more obscure than it was before,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36773' title='36773'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='36774' title='36774'>They undoubtedly showed that the affair was much deeper than was at first conjectured. </span>
<span sid='36775' title='36775'>I thought the matter over, and I came to the conclusion that I must approach the case from another aspect. </span>
<span sid='36776' title='36776'>But really, Watson, I am keeping you up, and I might just as well tell you all this on our way to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Aldershot&t=h'>Aldershot</a> to-morrow.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36777' title='36777'>'Thank you, you've gone rather too far to stop.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36778' title='36778'>'It was quite certain that when Mrs Barclay left the house at half-past seven she was on good terms with her husband. </span>
<span sid='36779' title='36779'>She was never, as I think I have said, ostentatiously affectionate, but she was heard by the coachman chatting with the Colonel in a friendly fashion. </span>
<span sid='36780' title='36780'>Now, it was equally certain that immediately on her return she had gone to the room in which she was least likely to see her husband, had flown to tea, as an agitated woman will, and, finally, on his coming in to her, had broken into violent recriminations. </span>
<span sid='36781' title='36781'>Therefore, something had occurred between seven-thirty and nine o'clock which had completely altered her feelings towards him. </span>
<span sid='36782' title='36782'>But Miss Morrison had been with her during the whole of that hour and a half. </span>
<span sid='36783' title='36783'>It was absolutely certain, therefore, in spite of her denial, that she must know something of the matter.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36784' title='36784'>'My first conjecture was that possibly there had been some passages between this young woman and the old soldier, which the former had now confessed to the wife. </span>
<span sid='36785' title='36785'>That would account for the angry return and also for the girl's denial that anything had occurred. </span>
<span sid='36786' title='36786'>Nor would it be entirely incompatible with most of the words overheard. </span>
<span sid='36787' title='36787'>But there was the reference to David, and there was the known affection of the Colonel for his wife to weigh against it, to say nothing of the tragic intrusion of this other man, which might, of course, be entirely disconnected with what had gone before. </span>
<span sid='36788' title='36788'>It was not easy to pick one's steps, but on the whole I was inclined to dismiss the idea that there had been anything between the Colonel and Miss Morrison, but more than ever convinced that the young lady held the clue as to what it was which had turned Mrs Barclay to hatred of her husband. </span>
<span sid='36789' title='36789'>I took the obvious course, therefore, of calling upon Miss Morrison, of explaining to her that I was perfectly certain that she held the 'facts in her possession, and of assuring her that her friend, Mrs Barclay, might find herself in the dock upon a capital charge unless the matter were cleared up.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36790' title='36790'>'Miss Morrison is a little, ethereal slip of a girl, with timid eyes and blonde hair, but I found her by no means wanting in shrewdness and common sense. </span>
<span sid='36791' title='36791'>She sat thinking for some time after I had spoken, and then turning to me with a brisk air of resolution, she broke into a remarkable statement, which I will condense for your benefit.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36792' title='36792'>'"I promised my friend that I would say nothing of the matter, and a promise is a promise," said she. </span>
<span sid='36793' title='36793'>"But if I can really help her when so serious a charge is made against her, and when her own mouth, poor darling, is closed by illness, then I think I am absolved from my promise. </span>
<span sid='36794' title='36794'>I will tell you exactly what happened on Monday evening.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36795' title='36795'>'"We were returning from the Watt Street Mission, about a quarter to nine o'clock. </span>
<span sid='36796' title='36796'>On our way we had to pass through Hudson Street, which is a very quiet thoroughfare. </span>
<span sid='36797' title='36797'>There is only one lamp in it upon the left-hand side, and as we approached this lamp I saw a man coming towards us with his back very bent, and something like a box slung over one of his shoulders. </span>
<span sid='36798' title='36798'>He appeared to be deformed, for he carried his head low, and walked with his knees bent. </span>
<span sid='36799' title='36799'>We were passing him when he raised his face to look at us in the circle of light thrown by the lamp, and as he did so he stopped and screamed out in a dreadful voice, 'My God, it's Nancy!' </span>
<span sid='36800' title='36800'>Mrs Barclay turned as white as death, and would have fallen down had the dreadful-looking creature not caught hold of her. </span>
<span sid='36801' title='36801'>I was going to call for the police, but she, to my surprise, spoke quite civilly to the fellow. </span>
<span sid='36802' title='36802'>'"'I thought you had been dead this thirty years, Henry,' said she, in a shaking voice.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36803' title='36803'>'"'So I have,' said he, and it was awful to hear the tones that he said it in. </span>
<span sid='36804' title='36804'>He had a very dark, fearsome face, and a gleam in his eyes that comes back to me in my dreams. </span>
<span sid='36805' title='36805'>His hair and whiskers were shot with grey, and his face was all crinkled and puckered like a withered apple.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36806' title='36806'>'"'Just walk on a little way, dear,' said Mrs Barclay. </span>
<span sid='36807' title='36807'>'I want to have a word with this man. </span>
<span sid='36808' title='36808'>There is nothing to be afraid of.' </span>
<span sid='36809' title='36809'>She tried to speak boldly, but she was still deadly pale, and could hardly get her words out for the trembling of her lips.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36810' title='36810'>'"I did as she asked me, and they talked together for a few minutes. </span>
<span sid='36811' title='36811'>Then she came down the street with her eyes blazing, and I saw the crippled wretch standing by the lamp-post and shaking his clenched fists in the air, as if he were mad with rage. </span>
<span sid='36812' title='36812'>She never said a word until we were at the door here, when she took me by the hand and begged me to tell no one what had happened. </span>
<span sid='36813' title='36813'>'It is an old acquaintance of mine who has come down in the world,' said she. </span>
<span sid='36814' title='36814'>When I promised her that I would say nothing she kissed me, and I have never seen her since. </span>
<span sid='36815' title='36815'>I have told you now the whole truth, and if I withheld it from the police it is because I did not realize then the danger in which my dear friend stood. </span>
<span sid='36816' title='36816'>I know that it can only be to her advantage that everything should be known."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36817' title='36817'>'There was her statement, Watson, and to me, as you can imagine, it was like a light on a dark night. </span>
<span sid='36818' title='36818'>Everything which had been disconnected before began at once to assume its true place, and I had a shadowy presentiment of the whole sequence of events. </span>
<span sid='36819' title='36819'>My next step obviously was to find the man who had produced such a remarkable impression upon Mrs Barclay. </span>
<span sid='36820' title='36820'>If he were still in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Aldershot&t=h'>Aldershot</a> it should not be a very difficult matter. </span>
<span sid='36821' title='36821'>There are not such a very great number of civilians, and a deformed man was sure to have attracted attention. </span>
<span sid='36822' title='36822'>I spent a day in the search, and by evening - this very evening, Watson - I had run him down. </span>
<span sid='36823' title='36823'>The man's name is Henry Wood, and he lives in lodgings in the same street in which the ladies met him. </span>
<span sid='36824' title='36824'>He has only been five days in the place. </span>
<span sid='36825' title='36825'>In the character of a registration agent I had a most interesting gossip with his landlady. </span>
<span sid='36826' title='36826'>The man is by trade a conjurer and performer, going round the canteens, after nightfall, and giving a little entertainment at each. </span>
<span sid='36827' title='36827'>He carries some creature about with him in his box, about which the landlady seemed to be in considerable trepidation, for she had never seen an animal like it. </span>
<span sid='36828' title='36828'>He uses it in some of his tricks, according to her account. </span>
<span sid='36829' title='36829'>So much the woman was able to tell me, and also that it was a wonder the man lived, seeing how twisted he was, and that he spoke in a strange tongue sometimes, and that for the last two nights she had heard him groaning and weeping in his bedroom. </span>
<span sid='36830' title='36830'>He was all right as far as money went, but in his deposit he had given her what looked like a bad florin. </span>
<span sid='36831' title='36831'>She showed it to me, Watson, and it was an Indian rupee.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36832' title='36832'>'So now, my dear fellow, you see exactly how we stand and why it is I want you. </span>
<span sid='36833' title='36833'>It is perfectly plain that after the ladies parted from this than he followed them at a distance, that he saw the quarrel between husband and wife through the window, that he rushed in, and that the creature which he carried in his box got loose. </span>
<span sid='36834' title='36834'>That is all very certain. </span>
<span sid='36835' title='36835'>But he is the only person in this world who can tell us exactly what happened in that room.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36836' title='36836'>'And you intend to ask him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36837' title='36837'>'Most certainly - but in the presence of a witness.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36838' title='36838'>'And I am the witness?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36839' title='36839'>'If you will be so good. </span>
<span sid='36840' title='36840'>If he can clear the matter up, well and good. </span>
<span sid='36841' title='36841'>If he refuses, we have no alternative but to apply for a warrant.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36842' title='36842'>'But how do you know he will be there when we return?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36843' title='36843'>'You may be sure that I took some precautions. </span>
<span sid='36844' title='36844'>I have one of my <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> boys mounting guard over him who would stick to him like a burr, go where he might. </span>
<span sid='36845' title='36845'>We shall find him in Hudson Street to-morrow, Watson; and meanwhile I should be the criminal myself if I kept you out of bed any longer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36846' title='36846'>It was midday when we found ourselves at the scene of the tragedy, and, under my companion's guidance, we made our way at once to Hudson Street. </span>
<span sid='36847' title='36847'>In spite of his capacity for concealing his emotions I could easily see that Holmes was in a state of suppressed excitement, while I was myself tingling with that half-sporting, half-intellectual pleasure which I invariably experienced when I associated myself with him in his investigations.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36848' title='36848'>'This is the street,' said he, as he turned into a short thoroughfare lined with plain, two-storied brick houses - 'Ah! here is Simpson to report.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36849' title='36849'>'He's in all right, Mr Holmes,' cried a small street Arab, running up to us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36850' title='36850'>'Good, Simpson!' said Holmes, patting him on the head. </span>
<span sid='36851' title='36851'>'Come along, Watson. </span>
<span sid='36852' title='36852'>This is the house.' </span>
<span sid='36853' title='36853'>He sent in his card with a message that he had come on important business, and a moment later we were face to face with the man whom we had come to see. </span>
<span sid='36854' title='36854'>In spite of the warm weather he was crouching over a fire, and the little room was like an oven. </span>
<span sid='36855' title='36855'>The man sat all twisted and huddled in his chair in a way which gave an indescribable impression of deformity, but the face which he turned towards us, though worn and swarthy, must at some time have been remarkable for its beauty. </span>
<span sid='36856' title='36856'>He looked suspiciously at us now out of yellow-shot bilious eyes, and, without speaking or rising, he waved towards two chairs.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36857' title='36857'>'Mr Henry Wood, late of India, I believe?' said Holmes, affably. </span>
<span sid='36858' title='36858'>'I've come over this little matter of Colonel Barclay's death.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36859' title='36859'>'What should I know about that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36860' title='36860'>'That's what I wanted to ascertain. </span>
<span sid='36861' title='36861'>You know, I suppose, that unless the matter is cleared up, Mrs Barclay, who is an old friend of yours, will in all probability be tried for murder?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36862' title='36862'>The man gave a violent start.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36863' title='36863'>'I don't know who you are,' he cried, 'nor how you come to know what you do know; but will you swear that this is true that you tell me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36864' title='36864'>'Why, they are only waiting for her to come to her senses to arrest her.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36865' title='36865'>'My God! </span>
<span sid='36866' title='36866'>Are you in the police yourself?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36867' title='36867'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36868' title='36868'>'What business is it of yours, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36869' title='36869'>'It's every man's business to see justice done.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36870' title='36870'>'You can take my word that she is innocent.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36871' title='36871'>'Then you are guilty?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36872' title='36872'>'No, I am not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36873' title='36873'>'Who killed Colonel James Barclay, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36874' title='36874'>'It was a just Providence that killed him. </span>
<span sid='36875' title='36875'>But mind you this, that if I had knocked his brains out, as it was in my heart to do, he would have had no more than his due from my hands. </span>
<span sid='36876' title='36876'>If his own guilty conscience had not struck him down, it is likely enough that I might have had his blood upon my soul. </span>
<span sid='36877' title='36877'>You want me to tell the story? </span>
<span sid='36878' title='36878'>Well, I don't know why I shouldn't, for there's no cause for me to be ashamed of it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36879' title='36879'>'It was in this way, sir. </span>
<span sid='36880' title='36880'>You see me now with my back like a camel and my ribs all awry, but there was a time when Corporal Henry Wood was the smartest man in the 117th Foot. </span>
<span sid='36881' title='36881'>We were in India then, in cantonments, at a place we'll call Bhurtee. </span>
<span sid='36882' title='36882'>Barclay, who died the other day, was sergeant in the same company as myself, and the belle of the regiment - aye, and the finest girl that ever had the breath of life between her lips - was Nancy Devoy, the daughter of the colour-sergeant. </span>
<span sid='36883' title='36883'>There were two men who loved her, and one whom she loved; and you'll smile when you look at this poor thing huddled before the fire, and hear me say that it was for my good looks that she loved me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36884' title='36884'>'Well, though I had her heart her father was set upon her marrying Barclay. </span>
<span sid='36885' title='36885'>I was a harum-scarum, reckless lad, and he had had an education, and was already marked for the sword-belt. </span>
<span sid='36886' title='36886'>But the girl held true to me, and it seemed that I would have had her, when the Mutiny broke out, and all Hell was loose in the country.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36887' title='36887'>'We were shut up in Bhurtee, the regiment of us, with half a battery of artillery, a company of Sikhs, and a lot of civilians and women-folk. </span>
<span sid='36888' title='36888'>There were ten thousand rebels round us, and they were as keen as a set of terriers round a rat-cage. </span>
<span sid='36889' title='36889'>About the second week of it our water gave out, and it was a question whether we could communicate with General Neill's column, which was moving up country. </span>
<span sid='36890' title='36890'>It was our only chance, for we could not hope to fight our way out with all the women and children, so I volunteered to go out and warn General Neill of our danger. </span>
<span sid='36891' title='36891'>My offer was accepted, and I talked it over with Sergeant Barclay, who was supposed to know the ground better than any other man, and who drew up a route by which I might get through the rebel lines. </span>
<span sid='36892' title='36892'>At ten o'clock the same night I started off upon my journey. </span>
<span sid='36893' title='36893'>There were a thousand lives to save, but it was of only one that I was thinking when I dropped over the wall that night.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36894' title='36894'>'My way ran down a dried-up watercourse, which we hoped would screen me from the enemy's sentries, but as I crept round the corner of it I walked right into six of them, who were crouching down in the dark waiting for me. </span>
<span sid='36895' title='36895'>In an instant I was stunned with a blow, and bound hand and foot. </span>
<span sid='36896' title='36896'>But the real blow was to my heart and not to my head, for as I came to and listened to as much as I could understand of their talk, I heard enough to tell me that my comrade, the very man who had arranged the way I was to take, had betrayed me by means of a native servant into the hands of the enemy.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36897' title='36897'>'Well, there's no need for me to dwell on that part of it. </span>
<span sid='36898' title='36898'>You know now what James Barclay was capable of. </span>
<span sid='36899' title='36899'>Bhurtee was relieved by Neill next day, but the rebels took me away with them in their retreat, and it was many a long year before ever I saw a white face again. </span>
<span sid='36900' title='36900'>I was tortured, and tried to get away, and was captured and tortured again. </span>
<span sid='36901' title='36901'>You can see for yourselves the state in which I was left. </span>
<span sid='36902' title='36902'>Some of them that fled into <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Nepal&t=h'>Nepal</a> took me with them, and then afterwards I was up past <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Darjeeling&t=h'>Darjeeling</a>. </span>
<span sid='36903' title='36903'>The hill-folk up there murdered the rebels who had me, and I became their slave for a time until I escaped, but instead of going south I had to go north, until I found myself among the Afghans. </span>
<span sid='36904' title='36904'>There I wandered about for many a year, and at last came back to the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Punjab&t=h'>Punjab</a>, where I lived mostly among the natives, and picked up a living by the conjuring tricks that I had learned. </span>
<span sid='36905' title='36905'>What use was it for me, a wretched cripple, to go back to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, or to make myself known to my old comrades? </span>
<span sid='36906' title='36906'>Even my wish for revenge would not make me do that. </span>
<span sid='36907' title='36907'>I had rather that Nancy and my old pals should think of Harry Wood as having died with a straight back, than see him living and crawling with a stick like a chimpanzee. </span>
<span sid='36908' title='36908'>They never doubted that I was dead, and I meant that they never should. </span>
<span sid='36909' title='36909'>I heard that Barclay had married Nancy, and that he was rapidly rising in the regiment, but even that did not make me speak.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36910' title='36910'>'But when one gets old, one has a longing for home. </span>
<span sid='36911' title='36911'>For years I've been dreaming of the bright green fields and the hedges of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>. </span>
<span sid='36912' title='36912'>At last I determined to see them before I died. </span>
<span sid='36913' title='36913'>I saved enough to bring me across, and then I came here where the soldiers are, for I know their ways, and how to amuse them, and so earn enough to keep me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36914' title='36914'>'Your narrative is most interesting,' said Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='36915' title='36915'>'I have already heard of your meeting with Mrs Barclay and your mutual recognition. </span>
<span sid='36916' title='36916'>You then, as I understand, followed her home and saw through the window an altercation between her husband and her, in which she doubtless cast his conduct to you in his teeth. </span>
<span sid='36917' title='36917'>Your own feelings overcame you, and you ran across the lawn, and broke in upon them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36918' title='36918'>'I did, sir, and at the sight of me he looked as I have never seen a man look before, and over he went with his head on the fender. </span>
<span sid='36919' title='36919'>But he was dead before he fell. </span>
<span sid='36920' title='36920'>I read death on his face as plain as I can read that text over the fire. </span>
<span sid='36921' title='36921'>The bare sight of me was like a bullet through his guilty heart.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36922' title='36922'>'And then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36923' title='36923'>'Then Nancy fainted, and I caught up the key of the door from her hand, intending to unlock it and get help. </span>
<span sid='36924' title='36924'>But as I was doing it it seemed to me better to leave it alone and get away, for the thing might look black against me, and any way my secret would be out if I were taken. </span>
<span sid='36925' title='36925'>In my haste I thrust the key into my pocket, and dropped my stick while I was chasing Teddy, who had run up the curtain. </span>
<span sid='36926' title='36926'>When I got him into his box, from which he had slipped, I was off as fast as I could run.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36927' title='36927'>'Who's Teddy?' asked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36928' title='36928'>The man leaned over and pulled up the front of a kind of hutch in the corner. </span>
<span sid='36929' title='36929'>In an instant out there slipped a beautiful reddish-brown creature, thin, and lithe, with the legs of a stoat, a long thin nose, and a pair of the finest red eyes that ever I saw in an animal's head.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36930' title='36930'>'It's a mongoose!' I cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36931' title='36931'>'Well, some call them that, and some call them ichneumon,' said the man. </span>
<span sid='36932' title='36932'>'Snake-catcher is what I call them, and Teddy is amazing quick on cobras. </span>
<span sid='36933' title='36933'>I have one here without the fangs, and Teddy catches it every night to please the folk in the canteen. </span>
<span sid='36934' title='36934'>Any other point, sir?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36935' title='36935'>'Well, we may have to apply to you again if Mrs Barclay should prove to be in serious trouble.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36936' title='36936'>'In that case, of course, I'd come forward.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36937' title='36937'>'But if not, there is no object in raking up this scandal against a dead man, foully as he has acted. </span>
<span sid='36938' title='36938'>You have, at least, the satisfaction of knowing that for thirty years of his life his conscience bitterly reproached him for his wicked deed. </span>
<span sid='36939' title='36939'>Ah, there goes Major Murphy on the other side of the street. </span>
<span sid='36940' title='36940'>Good-bye, Wood; I want to learn if anything has happened since yesterday.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36941' title='36941'>We were in time to overtake the Major before he reached the corner.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36942' title='36942'>'Ah, Holmes,' he said, 'I suppose you have heard that all this fuss has come to nothing?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36943' title='36943'>'What, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36944' title='36944'>'The inquest is just over. </span>
<span sid='36945' title='36945'>The medical evidence showed conclusively that death was due to apoplexy. </span>
<span sid='36946' title='36946'>You see, it was quite a simple case after all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36947' title='36947'>'Oh, remarkably superficial,' said Holmes, smiling. </span>
<span sid='36948' title='36948'>'Come, Watson, I don't think we shall be wanted in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Aldershot&t=h'>Aldershot</a> any more.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36949' title='36949'>'There's one thing,' said I, as we walked down to the station; 'if the husband's name was James, and the other was Henry, what was this talk about David?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36950' title='36950'>'That one word, my dear Watson, should have told me the whole story had I been the ideal reasoner which you are so fond of depicting. </span>
<span sid='36951' title='36951'>It was evidently a term of reproach.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36952' title='36952'>'Of reproach?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36953' title='36953'>'Yes, David strayed a little now and then, you know, and on one occasion in the same direction as Sergeant James Barclay. </span>
<span sid='36954' title='36954'>You remember the small affair of Uriah and Bathsheba? </span>
<span sid='36955' title='36955'>My Biblical knowledge is a trifle rusty, I fear, but you will find the story in the first or second of Samuel.'</span>
