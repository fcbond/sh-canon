<p class="subtitle">Arthur Conan Doyle<label for="sn-meta-copp" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-meta-copp" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><!--googleoff: all--><b>Story Number</b>: 14<br><b>Published in</b>: The Strand Magazine in June 1892<br><b>Collected in</b>: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes<!--googleon: all--></span></p>
<p>
<span sid='32818' title='32818'>'To the man who loves art for its own sake,' remarked Sherlock Holmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily Telegraph, 'it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. </span>
<span sid='32819' title='32819'>It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much to the many causes celebres and sensational trials in which I have figured, but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special province.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32820' title='32820'>'And yet,' said I, smiling, 'I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32821' title='32821'>'You have erred, perhaps,' he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs, and lighting with it the long cherrywood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood -  'you have erred, perhaps, in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements, instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32822' title='32822'>'It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,' I remarked, with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend's singular character.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32823' title='32823'>'No, it is not selfishness or conceit,' said he, answering, as was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. </span>
<span sid='32824' title='32824'>'If I claim full justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing - a thing beyond myself. </span>
<span sid='32825' title='32825'>Crime is common. </span>
<span sid='32826' title='32826'>Logic is rare. </span>
<span sid='32827' title='32827'>Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell. </span>
<span sid='32828' title='32828'>You have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32829' title='32829'>It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='32830' title='32830'>A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs, through the heavy yellow wreaths. </span>
<span sid='32831' title='32831'>Our gas was lit, and shone on the white cloth, and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet. </span>
<span sid='32832' title='32832'>Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers, until at last, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32833' title='32833'>'At the same time,' he remarked, after a pause, during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down Into the fire, 'you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all. </span>
<span sid='32834' title='32834'>The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bohemia&t=h'>Bohemia</a>, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are outside the pale of the law. </span>
<span sid='32835' title='32835'>But in avoiding the sensational, I fear that you may have bordered on the trivial.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32836' title='32836'>'The end may have been so,' I answered, 'but the methods I hold to have been novel and of interest.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32837' title='32837'>'Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction! </span>
<span sid='32838' title='32838'>But, indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot blame you, for the days of the great cases are past. </span>
<span sid='32839' title='32839'>Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. </span>
<span sid='32840' title='32840'>As to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. </span>
<span sid='32841' title='32841'>I think that I have touched bottom at last, however. </span>
<span sid='32842' title='32842'>This note I had this morning marks my zero point, I fancy. </span>
<span sid='32843' title='32843'>Read it!' </span>
<span sid='32844' title='32844'>He tossed a crumpled letter across to me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32845' title='32845'>It was dated from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Montague Place&t=h'>Montague Place</a> upon the preceding evening, and ran thus:</span>
<p>
<span sid='32846' title='32846'>DEAR MR HOLMES - I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess. </span>
<span sid='32847' title='32847'>I shall call at half past ten tomorrow, if I do not inconvenience you.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32848' title='32848'>Yours faithfully,</span>
<p>
<span sid='32849' title='32849'>VIOLET HUNTER.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32850' title='32850'>'Do you know the young lady?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32851' title='32851'>'Not I.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32852' title='32852'>'It is half-past ten now.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32853' title='32853'>'Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32854' title='32854'>'It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. </span>
<span sid='32855' title='32855'>You remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation. </span>
<span sid='32856' title='32856'>It may be so in this case also.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32857' title='32857'>'Well, let us hope so! </span>
<span sid='32858' title='32858'>But our doubts will very soon be solved, for here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32859' title='32859'>As he spoke the door opened, and a young lady entered the room. </span>
<span sid='32860' title='32860'>She was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover's egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32861' title='32861'>'You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,' said she, as my companion rose to greet her; 'but I have had a very strange experience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should do.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32862' title='32862'>'Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. </span>
<span sid='32863' title='32863'>I shall be happy to do anything that I can to serve you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32864' title='32864'>I could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client. </span>
<span sid='32865' title='32865'>He looked her over in his searching fashion, and then composed himself with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together to listen to her story.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32866' title='32866'>'I have been a governess for five years,' said she, 'in the family of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the Colonel received an appointment at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Halifax&t=h'>Halifax</a>, in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Nova Scotia&t=h'>Nova Scotia</a>, and took his children over to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a> with him, so that I found myself without a situation. </span>
<span sid='32867' title='32867'>I advertised and I answered advertisements, but without success. </span>
<span sid='32868' title='32868'>At last the little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my wits' end as to what I should do.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32869' title='32869'>'There is a well-known agency for governesses in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the West&t=h'>the West</a> End called Westaway's, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me. </span>
<span sid='32870' title='32870'>Westaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss Stoper. </span>
<span sid='32871' title='32871'>She sits in her own little office, and the lathes who are seeking employment wait in an ante-room, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers, and sees whether she has anything which would suit them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32872' title='32872'>'Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. </span>
<span sid='32873' title='32873'>A prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face, and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat, sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the lathes who entered. </span>
<span sid='32874' title='32874'>As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair, and turned quickly to Miss Stoper:</span>
<p>
<span sid='32875' title='32875'>'"That will do," said he; "I could not ask for anything better. </span>
<span sid='32876' title='32876'>Capital! capital!" </span>
<span sid='32877' title='32877'>He seemed quite enthusiastic, and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion. </span>
<span sid='32878' title='32878'>He was such a comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32879' title='32879'>'"You are looking for a situation, miss?" he asked. </span>
<span sid='32880' title='32880'>"Yes, sir."</span>
<p>
<span sid='32881' title='32881'>'"As governess?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='32882' title='32882'>'"Yes, sir."</span>
<p>
<span sid='32883' title='32883'>'"And what salary do you ask?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='32884' title='32884'>'"I had four pounds a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro."</span>
<p>
<span sid='32885' title='32885'>'"Oh, tut, tut! sweating - rank sweating!" he cried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. </span>
<span sid='32886' title='32886'>"How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='32887' title='32887'>'"My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine," said I. </span>
<span sid='32888' title='32888'>"A little French, a little German, music and drawing - "</span>
<p>
<span sid='32889' title='32889'>'"Tut, tut!" he cried. </span>
<span sid='32890' title='32890'>"This is all quite beside the question. </span>
<span sid='32891' title='32891'>The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady? </span>
<span sid='32892' title='32892'>There it is in a nutshell. </span>
<span sid='32893' title='32893'>If you have not, you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country. </span>
<span sid='32894' title='32894'>But if you have, why, then how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures? </span>
<span sid='32895' title='32895'>Your salary with me, madam, would commence at a hundred pounds a year."</span>
<p>
<span sid='32896' title='32896'>'You may imagine, Mr Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer seemed almost too good to be true. </span>
<span sid='32897' title='32897'>The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a note.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32898' title='32898'>'"It is also my custom," said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two shining slits, amid the white creases of his face, "to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe."</span>
<p>
<span sid='32899' title='32899'>'It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man. </span>
<span sid='32900' title='32900'>As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed myself.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32901' title='32901'>'"May I ask where you live, sir?" said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32902' title='32902'>'"<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Hampshire&t=h'>Hampshire</a>. </span>
<span sid='32903' title='32903'>Charming rural place. </span>
<span sid='32904' title='32904'>The Copper Beeches, five miles on the far side of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Winchester&t=h'>Winchester</a>. </span>
<span sid='32905' title='32905'>It is the most lovely country, my dear young lady, and the dearest old country house."</span>
<p>
<span sid='32906' title='32906'>'"And my duties, sir? </span>
<span sid='32907' title='32907'>I should be glad to know what they would be."</span>
<p>
<span sid='32908' title='32908'>'"One child - one dear little romper just six years old. </span>
<span sid='32909' title='32909'>Oh, if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! </span>
<span sid='32910' title='32910'>Smack! smack! smack! </span>
<span sid='32911' title='32911'>Three gone before you could wink!" </span>
<span sid='32912' title='32912'>He leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32913' title='32913'>'I was a little startled at the nature of the child's amusement, but the father's laughter made me think that perhaps lie was joking.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32914' title='32914'>'"My sole duties, then," I asked, "are to take charge of a single child?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='32915' title='32915'>'"No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady," he cried. </span>
<span sid='32916' title='32916'>"Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any little commands which my wife might give, provided always that they were such commands is a lady might with propriety obey. </span>
<span sid='32917' title='32917'>You see no difficulty, heh?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='32918' title='32918'>'"I should be happy to make myself useful."</span>
<p>
<span sid='32919' title='32919'>'"Quite so. </span>
<span sid='32920' title='32920'>In dress now, for example! </span>
<span sid='32921' title='32921'>We are faddy people, you know - faddy, but kind-hearted. </span>
<span sid='32922' title='32922'>If you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim. </span>
<span sid='32923' title='32923'>Heh?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='32924' title='32924'>'"No," said I, considerably astonished at his words.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32925' title='32925'>'"Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='32926' title='32926'>'"Oh, no."</span>
<p>
<span sid='32927' title='32927'>'"Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='32928' title='32928'>'I could hardly believe my ears. </span>
<span sid='32929' title='32929'>As you may observe, Mr Holmes, my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut. </span>
<span sid='32930' title='32930'>It has been considered artistic. </span>
<span sid='32931' title='32931'>I could not dream of sacrificing it in this off-hand fashion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32932' title='32932'>'"I am afraid that that is quite impossible," said I. </span>
<span sid='32933' title='32933'>He had I em watching me eagerly out of his small eyes and I could et' a shadow pass over his face as I spoke.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32934' title='32934'>'"I am afraid that it is quite essential," said he. </span>
<span sid='32935' title='32935'>"It is a little fancy of my wife's, and ladies' fancies, you know, madam, ladies' fancies must be consulted. </span>
<span sid='32936' title='32936'>And so you won't la your hair?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='32937' title='32937'>'"No, sir, I really could not," I answered firmly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32938' title='32938'>'"Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. </span>
<span sid='32939' title='32939'>It is a pity, because in other respects you would really have done very nicely. </span>
<span sid='32940' title='32940'>In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies."</span>
<p>
<span sid='32941' title='32941'>'The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32942' title='32942'>'"Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?" she asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32943' title='32943'>'"If you please, Miss Stoper."</span>
<p>
<span sid='32944' title='32944'>'"Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion," said she sharply. </span>
<span sid='32945' title='32945'>"You can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you. </span>
<span sid='32946' title='32946'>Good-day to you, Miss Hunter." </span>
<span sid='32947' title='32947'>She struck a gong upon the table, and I was shown out by the page.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32948' title='32948'>'Well, Mr Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table, I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing. </span>
<span sid='32949' title='32949'>After all, if these people had strange fads, and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. </span>
<span sid='32950' title='32950'>Very few governesses in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> are getting a hundred a year. </span>
<span sid='32951' title='32951'>Besides, what use was my hair to me? </span>
<span sid='32952' title='32952'>Many people are improved by wearing it short, and perhaps I should be among the number. </span>
<span sid='32953' title='32953'>Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after I was sure of it. </span>
<span sid='32954' title='32954'>I had almost overcome my pride, so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open, when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. </span>
<span sid='32955' title='32955'>I have it here, and I will read it to you:</span>
<p>
<span sid='32956' title='32956'>The Copper Beeches, near <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Winchester&t=h'>Winchester</a></span>
<p>
<span sid='32957' title='32957'>DEAR MISS HUNTER,</span>
<p>
<span sid='32958' title='32958'>Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision. </span>
<span sid='32959' title='32959'>My wife is very anxious that you should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you. </span>
<span sid='32960' title='32960'>We are willing to give thirty pounds a quarter, or £120 a year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you. </span>
<span sid='32961' title='32961'>They are not very exacting after all. </span>
<span sid='32962' title='32962'>My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue, and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. </span>
<span sid='32963' title='32963'>You need not, however, go to the expense of purchasing new, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Philadelphia&t=h'>Philadelphia</a>) which would, I should think, fit you very well. </span>
<span sid='32964' title='32964'>Then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no inconvenience. </span>
<span sid='32965' title='32965'>As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss. </span>
<span sid='32966' title='32966'>Your duties, as far as the child is concerned, are very light. </span>
<span sid='32967' title='32967'>Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the dogcart at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Winchester&t=h'>Winchester</a>. </span>
<span sid='32968' title='32968'>Let me know your train.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32969' title='32969'>Yours faithfully,</span>
<p>
<span sid='32970' title='32970'>JEPHRO RUCASTLE.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32971' title='32971'>'That is the letter which I have just received, Mr Holmes, and my mind is made up that I will accept it. </span>
<span sid='32972' title='32972'>I thought, however, that before taking the final step, I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32973' title='32973'>'Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the question,' said Holmes, smiling.</span>
<p>
<span sid='32974' title='32974'>'But you would not advise me to refuse?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32975' title='32975'>'I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a sister of mine apply for.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32976' title='32976'>'What is the meaning of it all, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32977' title='32977'>'Ah, I have no data. </span>
<span sid='32978' title='32978'>I cannot tell. </span>
<span sid='32979' title='32979'>Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32980' title='32980'>'Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. </span>
<span sid='32981' title='32981'>Mr Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. </span>
<span sid='32982' title='32982'>Is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32983' title='32983'>'That is a possible solution - in fact, as matters stand, it is the most probable one. </span>
<span sid='32984' title='32984'>But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32985' title='32985'>'But the money, Mr Holmes, the money!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32986' title='32986'>'Well, yes, of course, the pay is good - too good. </span>
<span sid='32987' title='32987'>That is what makes me uneasy. </span>
<span sid='32988' title='32988'>Why should they give you £120 a year, when they could have their pick for £40? </span>
<span sid='32989' title='32989'>There must be some strong reason behind.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32990' title='32990'>'I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if I wanted your help. </span>
<span sid='32991' title='32991'>I should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32992' title='32992'>'Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. </span>
<span sid='32993' title='32993'>I assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months. </span>
<span sid='32994' title='32994'>There is something distinctly novel about some of the features. </span>
<span sid='32995' title='32995'>If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger - '</span>
<p>
<span sid='32996' title='32996'>'Danger! </span>
<span sid='32997' title='32997'>What danger do you foresee?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='32998' title='32998'>Holmes shook his head gravely. </span>
<span sid='32999' title='32999'>'It would cease to be a danger if we could define it,' said he. </span>
<span sid='33000' title='33000'>'But at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33001' title='33001'>'That is enough.' </span>
<span sid='33002' title='33002'>She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face. </span>
<span sid='33003' title='33003'>'I shall go down to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Hampshire&t=h'>Hampshire</a> quite easy in my mind now. </span>
<span sid='33004' title='33004'>I shall write to Mr Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair tonight, and start for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Winchester&t=h'>Winchester</a> to-morrow.' </span>
<span sid='33005' title='33005'>With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both good-night, and bustled off upon her way.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33006' title='33006'>'At least,' said I, as we heard her quick, firm step descending the stairs, 'she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33007' title='33007'>'And she would need to be,' said Holmes, gravely; 'I am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33008' title='33008'>It was not very long before my friend's prediction was fulfilled. </span>
<span sid='33009' title='33009'>A fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction, and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into. </span>
<span sid='33010' title='33010'>The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to determine. </span>
<span sid='33011' title='33011'>As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. </span>
<span sid='33012' title='33012'>'Data! data! data!' he cried impatiently. </span>
<span sid='33013' title='33013'>'I can't make bricks without clay.' </span>
<span sid='33014' title='33014'>And yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33015' title='33015'>The telegram which we eventually received came late one night, just as I was thinking of turning in, and Holmes was settling down to one of those all-night researches which he frequently indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night, and find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the morning. </span>
<span sid='33016' title='33016'>He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33017' title='33017'>'Just look up the trains in Bradshaw; said he, and turned back to his chemical studies.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33018' title='33018'>The summons was a brief and urgent one.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33019' title='33019'>Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Winchester&t=h'>Winchester</a> at midday tomorrow (it said). </span>
<span sid='33020' title='33020'>Do come! </span>
<span sid='33021' title='33021'>I am at my wits' end.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33022' title='33022'>HUNTER.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33023' title='33023'>'Will you come with me?' asked Holmes, glancing up. </span>
<span sid='33024' title='33024'>'I should wish to.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33025' title='33025'>'Just look it up, then.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33026' title='33026'>'There is a train at half-past nine,' said I, glancing over my Bradshaw. </span>
<span sid='33027' title='33027'>'It is due at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Winchester&t=h'>Winchester</a> at 11.30.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33028' title='33028'>'That will do very nicely. </span>
<span sid='33029' title='33029'>Then perhaps I had better postpone my analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33030' title='33030'>By eleven o'clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old English capital. </span>
<span sid='33031' title='33031'>Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down, but after we had passed We <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Hampshire&t=h'>Hampshire</a> border he threw them down, and began to admire the scenery. </span>
<span sid='33032' title='33032'>It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east. </span>
<span sid='33033' title='33033'>The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man's energy. </span>
<span sid='33034' title='33034'>All over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Aldershot&t=h'>Aldershot</a>, the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amidst the light green of the new foliage.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33035' title='33035'>'Are they not fresh and beautiful?' I cried, with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='33036' title='33036'>But Holmes shook his head gravely.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33037' title='33037'>'Do you know, Watson,' said he, 'that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject. </span>
<span sid='33038' title='33038'>You look at these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. </span>
<span sid='33039' title='33039'>I look at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation, and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33040' title='33040'>'Good heavens!' I cried. </span>
<span sid='33041' title='33041'>'Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33042' title='33042'>'They always fill me with a certain horror. </span>
<span sid='33043' title='33043'>It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33044' title='33044'>'You horrify me!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33045' title='33045'>'But the reason is very obvious. </span>
<span sid='33046' title='33046'>The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. </span>
<span sid='33047' title='33047'>There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard's blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. </span>
<span sid='33048' title='33048'>But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. </span>
<span sid='33049' title='33049'>Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. </span>
<span sid='33050' title='33050'>Had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Winchester&t=h'>Winchester</a>, I should never have had a fear for her. </span>
<span sid='33051' title='33051'>It is the five miles of country which makes the danger. </span>
<span sid='33052' title='33052'>Still, it is clear that she is not personally threatened.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33053' title='33053'>'No. </span>
<span sid='33054' title='33054'>If she can come to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Winchester&t=h'>Winchester</a> to meet us she can get away.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33055' title='33055'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='33056' title='33056'>She has her freedom.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33057' title='33057'>'What can be the matter, then? </span>
<span sid='33058' title='33058'>Can you suggest no explanation?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33059' title='33059'>'I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them. </span>
<span sid='33060' title='33060'>But which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us. </span>
<span sid='33061' title='33061'>Well, there is the tower of the Cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33062' title='33062'>The 'Black Swan' is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. </span>
<span sid='33063' title='33063'>She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33064' title='33064'>'I am so delighted that you have come,' she said earnestly, 'it is so kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. </span>
<span sid='33065' title='33065'>Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33066' title='33066'>'Pray tell us what has happened to you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33067' title='33067'>'I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr Rucastle to be back before three. </span>
<span sid='33068' title='33068'>I got his leave to come into town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33069' title='33069'>'Let us have everything in its due order.' </span>
<span sid='33070' title='33070'>Holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire, and composed himself to listen.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33071' title='33071'>'In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no actual ill-treatment from Mr and Mrs Rucastle. </span>
<span sid='33072' title='33072'>It is only fair to them to say that. </span>
<span sid='33073' title='33073'>But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my mind about them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33074' title='33074'>'What can you not understand?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33075' title='33075'>'Their reasons for their conduct. </span>
<span sid='33076' title='33076'>But you shall have it all just as it occurred. </span>
<span sid='33077' title='33077'>When I came down Mr Rucastle met me here, and drove me in his dog-cart to Copper Beeches. </span>
<span sid='33078' title='33078'>It is, as he said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. </span>
<span sid='33079' title='33079'>There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Southampton&t=h'>Southampton</a> high-road, which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. </span>
<span sid='33080' title='33080'>This ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord Southerton's preserves. </span>
<span sid='33081' title='33081'>A clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33082' title='33082'>'I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. </span>
<span sid='33083' title='33083'>There was no truth, Mr Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='33084' title='33084'>Mrs Rucastle is not mad. </span>
<span sid='33085' title='33085'>I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than forty-five. </span>
<span sid='33086' title='33086'>From their conversation I have gathered that they have been married about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Philadelphia&t=h'>Philadelphia</a>. </span>
<span sid='33087' title='33087'>Mr Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. </span>
<span sid='33088' title='33088'>As the daughter would not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her father's young wife.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33089' title='33089'>'Mrs Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature. </span>
<span sid='33090' title='33090'>She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. </span>
<span sid='33091' title='33091'>She was a nonentity. </span>
<span sid='33092' title='33092'>It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son. </span>
<span sid='33093' title='33093'>Her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible. </span>
<span sid='33094' title='33094'>He was kind to her also in his bluff boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple. </span>
<span sid='33095' title='33095'>And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. </span>
<span sid='33096' title='33096'>She would often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. </span>
<span sid='33097' title='33097'>More than once I have surprised her in tears. </span>
<span sid='33098' title='33098'>I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so utterly spoilt and so ill-natured a little creature. </span>
<span sid='33099' title='33099'>He is small for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. </span>
<span sid='33100' title='33100'>His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. </span>
<span sid='33101' title='33101'>Giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects. </span>
<span sid='33102' title='33102'>But I would rather not talk about the creature, Mr Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33103' title='33103'>'I am glad of all details,' remarked my friend, 'whether they seem to you to be relevant or not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33104' title='33104'>'I shall try not to miss anything of importance. </span>
<span sid='33105' title='33105'>The one unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and conduct of the servants. </span>
<span sid='33106' title='33106'>There are only two, a man and his wife. </span>
<span sid='33107' title='33107'>Toller, for that's his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. </span>
<span sid='33108' title='33108'>Twice since I have been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it. </span>
<span sid='33109' title='33109'>His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as silent as Mrs Rucastle, and much less amiable. </span>
<span sid='33110' title='33110'>They are a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of the building.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33111' title='33111'>'For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very quiet; on the third, Mrs Rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33112' title='33112'>'"Oh yes," said he, turning to me, "we are very much obliged to you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair. </span>
<span sid='33113' title='33113'>I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance. </span>
<span sid='33114' title='33114'>We shall now see how the electric blue dress will become you. </span>
<span sid='33115' title='33115'>You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged."</span>
<p>
<span sid='33116' title='33116'>'The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue. </span>
<span sid='33117' title='33117'>It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. </span>
<span sid='33118' title='33118'>It could not have been a better fit if I had been measured for it. </span>
<span sid='33119' title='33119'>Both Mr and Mrs Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. </span>
<span sid='33120' title='33120'>They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor. </span>
<span sid='33121' title='33121'>A chair had been placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. </span>
<span sid='33122' title='33122'>In this I was asked to sit, and then Mr Rucastle, walking up and down on the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that I have ever listened to. </span>
<span sid='33123' title='33123'>You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. </span>
<span sid='33124' title='33124'>Mrs Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. </span>
<span sid='33125' title='33125'>After an hour or so Mr Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress, and go to little Edward in the nursery.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33126' title='33126'>'Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances. </span>
<span sid='33127' title='33127'>Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense repertoire, and which he told inimitably. </span>
<span sid='33128' title='33128'>Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and, moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. </span>
<span sid='33129' title='33129'>I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and change my dress.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33130' title='33130'>'You can easily imagine, Mr Holmes, how curious I became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. </span>
<span sid='33131' title='33131'>They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back. </span>
<span sid='33132' title='33132'>At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a means. </span>
<span sid='33133' title='33133'>My hand mirror had been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a little of the glass in my handkerchief. </span>
<span sid='33134' title='33134'>On the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me. </span>
<span sid='33135' title='33135'>I confess that I was disappointed. </span>
<span sid='33136' title='33136'>There was nothing.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33137' title='33137'>'At least, that was my first impression. </span>
<span sid='33138' title='33138'>At the second glance, however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Southampton&t=h'>Southampton</a> Road, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. </span>
<span sid='33139' title='33139'>The road is an important highway, and there are usually people there. </span>
<span sid='33140' title='33140'>This man, however, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field, and was looking earnestly. </span>
<span sid='33141' title='33141'>I lowered my handkerchief, and glanced at Mrs Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. </span>
<span sid='33142' title='33142'>She said nothing, but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand, and had seen what was behind me. </span>
<span sid='33143' title='33143'>She rose at once.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33144' title='33144'>'"Jephro," said she, "there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at Miss Hunter."</span>
<p>
<span sid='33145' title='33145'>'"No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?" he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33146' title='33146'>'"No; I know no one in these parts."</span>
<p>
<span sid='33147' title='33147'>'"Dear me! </span>
<span sid='33148' title='33148'>How very impertinent! </span>
<span sid='33149' title='33149'>Kindly turn round, and motion him to go away."</span>
<p>
<span sid='33150' title='33150'>'"Surely it would be better to take no notice?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='33151' title='33151'>'"No, no, we should have him loitering here always. </span>
<span sid='33152' title='33152'>Kindly turn round, and wave him away like that."</span>
<p>
<span sid='33153' title='33153'>'I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs Rucastle drew down the blind. </span>
<span sid='33154' title='33154'>That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33155' title='33155'>'Pray continue,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='33156' title='33156'>'Your narrative promises to be a most interesting one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33157' title='33157'>'You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak. </span>
<span sid='33158' title='33158'>On the very first day I was at Copper Beeches, Mr Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door, as we approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33159' title='33159'>'"Look in here!" said Mr Rucastle, showing a slit between two planks. </span>
<span sid='33160' title='33160'>"Is he not a beauty?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='33161' title='33161'>'I looked through, and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33162' title='33162'>'"Don't be frightened," said my employer, laughing at the start which I had given. </span>
<span sid='33163' title='33163'>"It's only Carlo, my mastiff. </span>
<span sid='33164' title='33164'>I call him mine, but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. </span>
<span sid='33165' title='33165'>We feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as keen as mustard. </span>
<span sid='33166' title='33166'>Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. </span>
<span sid='33167' title='33167'>For goodness' sake don't you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it is as much as your life is worth."</span>
<p>
<span sid='33168' title='33168'>The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o'clock in the morning. </span>
<span sid='33169' title='33169'>It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day. </span>
<span sid='33170' title='33170'>I was standing, wrapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches. </span>
<span sid='33171' title='33171'>As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. </span>
<span sid='33172' title='33172'>It was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny-tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. </span>
<span sid='33173' title='33173'>It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side. </span>
<span sid='33174' title='33174'>That dreadful silent sentinel sent a chill to my heart, which I do not think that any burglar could have done.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33175' title='33175'>'And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. </span>
<span sid='33176' title='33176'>I had, as you know, cut off my hair in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk. </span>
<span sid='33177' title='33177'>One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things. </span>
<span sid='33178' title='33178'>There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. </span>
<span sid='33179' title='33179'>I had filled the two first with my linen and, as I had still much to pack away, I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. </span>
<span sid='33180' title='33180'>It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. </span>
<span sid='33181' title='33181'>The very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. </span>
<span sid='33182' title='33182'>There was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. </span>
<span sid='33183' title='33183'>It was my coil of hair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33184' title='33184'>'I took it up and examined it. </span>
<span sid='33185' title='33185'>It was of the same peculiar tint, and the same thickness. </span>
<span sid='33186' title='33186'>But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me. </span>
<span sid='33187' title='33187'>How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? </span>
<span sid='33188' title='33188'>With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. </span>
<span sid='33189' title='33189'>I laid the two tresses together, and I assure you they were identical. </span>
<span sid='33190' title='33190'>Was it not extraordinary? </span>
<span sid='33191' title='33191'>Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. </span>
<span sid='33192' title='33192'>I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles, as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33193' title='33193'>'I am naturally observant as you may have remarked, Mr Holmes, and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. </span>
<span sid='33194' title='33194'>There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. </span>
<span sid='33195' title='33195'>A door which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked. </span>
<span sid='33196' title='33196'>One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr Rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round jovial man to whom I was accustomed. </span>
<span sid='33197' title='33197'>His cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with passion. </span>
<span sid='33198' title='33198'>He locked the door, and hurried past me without a word or a look.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33199' title='33199'>'This aroused my curiosity; so when I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows of this part of the house. </span>
<span sid='33200' title='33200'>There were four of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. </span>
<span sid='33201' title='33201'>They were evidently all deserted. </span>
<span sid='33202' title='33202'>As I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33203' title='33203'>'"Ah!" said he, "you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word, my dear young lady. </span>
<span sid='33204' title='33204'>I was preoccupied with business matters."</span>
<p>
<span sid='33205' title='33205'>'I assured him that I was not offended. </span>
<span sid='33206' title='33206'>"By the way," said I, "you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the shutters up."</span>
<p>
<span sid='33207' title='33207'>'"Photography is one of my hobbies," said he. </span>
<span sid='33208' title='33208'>"I have made my dark room up there. </span>
<span sid='33209' title='33209'>But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon. </span>
<span sid='33210' title='33210'>Who would have believed it? </span>
<span sid='33211' title='33211'>Who would have ever believed it?" </span>
<span sid='33212' title='33212'>He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me. </span>
<span sid='33213' title='33213'>I read suspicion there, and annoyance, but no jest.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33214' title='33214'>'Well, Mr Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on fire to go over them. </span>
<span sid='33215' title='33215'>It was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of that. </span>
<span sid='33216' title='33216'>It was more a feeling of duty - a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place. </span>
<span sid='33217' title='33217'>They talk of woman's instinct; perhaps it was woman's instinct which gave me that feeling. </span>
<span sid='33218' title='33218'>At any rate, it was there; and I was keenly on the look-out for any chance to pass the forbidden door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33219' title='33219'>'It was only yesterday that the chance came. </span>
<span sid='33220' title='33220'>I may tell you that, besides Mr Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door. </span>
<span sid='33221' title='33221'>Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was drunk; and, when I came upstairs, there was a key in the door. </span>
<span sid='33222' title='33222'>I have no doubt at all that he had left it there. </span>
<span sid='33223' title='33223'>Mr and Mrs Rucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. </span>
<span sid='33224' title='33224'>I turned the key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33225' title='33225'>'There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end. </span>
<span sid='33226' title='33226'>Round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open. </span>
<span sid='33227' title='33227'>They each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one, and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them. </span>
<span sid='33228' title='33228'>The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with stout cord. </span>
<span sid='33229' title='33229'>The door itself was locked as well, and the key was not there. </span>
<span sid='33230' title='33230'>This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness. </span>
<span sid='33231' title='33231'>Evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above. </span>
<span sid='33232' title='33232'>As I stood in the passage gazing at this sinister door, and wondering what secret it might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room, and saw a shadow pass backwards and forwards against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door. </span>
<span sid='33233' title='33233'>A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='33234' title='33234'>My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran - ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me, clutching at the skirt of my dress. </span>
<span sid='33235' title='33235'>I rushed down the passage, through the door, and straight into the arms of Mr Rucastle, who was waiting outside.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33236' title='33236'>'"So," said he, smiling, "it was you, then. </span>
<span sid='33237' title='33237'>I thought it must be when I saw the door open."</span>
<p>
<span sid='33238' title='33238'>'"Oh, I am so frightened!" I panted.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33239' title='33239'>'"My dear young lady! my dear young lady!" - you cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was - "and what has frightened you, my dear young lady?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='33240' title='33240'>'But his voice was just a little too coaxing. </span>
<span sid='33241' title='33241'>He overdid it. </span>
<span sid='33242' title='33242'>I was keenly on my guard against him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33243' title='33243'>'"I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing," I answered. </span>
<span sid='33244' title='33244'>"But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran out again. </span>
<span sid='33245' title='33245'>Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!"</span>
<p>
<span sid='33246' title='33246'>'"Only that?" said he, looking at me keenly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33247' title='33247'>'"Why, what do you think?" I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33248' title='33248'>'"Why do you think that I lock this door?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='33249' title='33249'>'"I am sure that I do not know."</span>
<p>
<span sid='33250' title='33250'>'"It is to keep people out who have no business there. </span>
<span sid='33251' title='33251'>Do you see?" </span>
<span sid='33252' title='33252'>He was still smiling in the most amiable manner. </span>
<span sid='33253' title='33253'>"I am sure if I had known - "</span>
<p>
<span sid='33254' title='33254'>'"Well, then, you know now. </span>
<span sid='33255' title='33255'>And if you ever put your foot over that threshold again - "here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon, "I'll throw you to the mastiff"</span>
<p>
<span sid='33256' title='33256'>'I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. </span>
<span sid='33257' title='33257'>I suppose that I must have rushed past him into my room. </span>
<span sid='33258' title='33258'>I remember nothing until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. </span>
<span sid='33259' title='33259'>Then I thought of you, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='33260' title='33260'>I could not live there longer without some advice. </span>
<span sid='33261' title='33261'>I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child. </span>
<span sid='33262' title='33262'>They were all horrible to me. </span>
<span sid='33263' title='33263'>If I could only bring you down all would be well. </span>
<span sid='33264' title='33264'>Of course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. </span>
<span sid='33265' title='33265'>My mind was soon made up. </span>
<span sid='33266' title='33266'>I would send you a wire. </span>
<span sid='33267' title='33267'>I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then returned, feeling very much easier. </span>
<span sid='33268' title='33268'>A horrible doubt came into my mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him free. </span>
<span sid='33269' title='33269'>I slipped in in safety, and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you. </span>
<span sid='33270' title='33270'>I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Winchester&t=h'>Winchester</a> this morning, but I must be back before three o'clock, for Mr and Mrs Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the evening, so that I must look after the child. </span>
<span sid='33271' title='33271'>Now I have told you all my adventures, Mr Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33272' title='33272'>Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. </span>
<span sid='33273' title='33273'>My friend rose now, and paced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33274' title='33274'>'Is Toller still drunk?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33275' title='33275'>'Yes. </span>
<span sid='33276' title='33276'>I heard his wife tell Mrs Rucastle that she could do nothing with him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33277' title='33277'>'That is well. </span>
<span sid='33278' title='33278'>And the Rucastles go out to-night?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33279' title='33279'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33280' title='33280'>'Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33281' title='33281'>'Yes, the wine cellar.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33282' title='33282'>'You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. </span>
<span sid='33283' title='33283'>Do you think that you could perform one more feat? </span>
<span sid='33284' title='33284'>I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite exceptional woman.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33285' title='33285'>'I will try. </span>
<span sid='33286' title='33286'>What is it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33287' title='33287'>'We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o'clock, my friend and I. </span>
<span sid='33288' title='33288'>The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be incapable. </span>
<span sid='33289' title='33289'>There only remains Mrs Toller, who might give the alarm. </span>
<span sid='33290' title='33290'>If you could send her into the cellar, on some errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33291' title='33291'>'I will do it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33292' title='33292'>'Excellent! </span>
<span sid='33293' title='33293'>We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. </span>
<span sid='33294' title='33294'>Of course there is only one feasible explanation. </span>
<span sid='33295' title='33295'>You have been brought there to personate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber. </span>
<span sid='33296' title='33296'>That is obvious. </span>
<span sid='33297' title='33297'>As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>. </span>
<span sid='33298' title='33298'>You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure, and the colour of your hair. </span>
<span sid='33299' title='33299'>Hers had been cut off, very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sacrificed also. </span>
<span sid='33300' title='33300'>By a curious chance you came upon her tresses. </span>
<span sid='33301' title='33301'>The man in the road was, undoubtedly, some friend of hers - possibly her fiancé - and no doubt as you wore the girl's dress, and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. </span>
<span sid='33302' title='33302'>The dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her. </span>
<span sid='33303' title='33303'>So much is fairly clear. </span>
<span sid='33304' title='33304'>The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33305' title='33305'>'What on earth has that to do with it?' I ejaculated.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33306' title='33306'>'My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. </span>
<span sid='33307' title='33307'>Don't you see that the converse is equally valid. </span>
<span sid='33308' title='33308'>I have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children. </span>
<span sid='33309' title='33309'>This child's disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty's sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33310' title='33310'>'I am sure that you are right, Mr Holmes,' cried our client. </span>
<span sid='33311' title='33311'>'A thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it. </span>
<span sid='33312' title='33312'>Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33313' title='33313'>'We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. </span>
<span sid='33314' title='33314'>We can do nothing until seven o'clock. </span>
<span sid='33315' title='33315'>At that hour we shall be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the mystery.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33316' title='33316'>We were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. </span>
<span sid='33317' title='33317'>The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the doorstep.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33318' title='33318'>'Have you managed it?' asked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33319' title='33319'>A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. </span>
<span sid='33320' title='33320'>'That is Mrs Toller in the cellar,' said she. </span>
<span sid='33321' title='33321'>'Her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug. </span>
<span sid='33322' title='33322'>Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr Rucastles;</span>
<p>
<span sid='33323' title='33323'>'You have done well indeed!' cried Holmes, with enthusiasm. </span>
<span sid='33324' title='33324'>'Now lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33325' title='33325'>We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described. </span>
<span sid='33326' title='33326'>Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. </span>
<span sid='33327' title='33327'>Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but without success. </span>
<span sid='33328' title='33328'>No sound came from within, and at the silence Holmes's face clouded over.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33329' title='33329'>'I trust that we are not too late,' said he. </span>
<span sid='33330' title='33330'>'I think, Miss Hunter, that we had better go in without you. </span>
<span sid='33331' title='33331'>Now, Watson, put your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33332' title='33332'>It was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength. </span>
<span sid='33333' title='33333'>Together we rushed into the room. </span>
<span sid='33334' title='33334'>It was empty. </span>
<span sid='33335' title='33335'>There was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. </span>
<span sid='33336' title='33336'>The skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33337' title='33337'>'There has been some villainy here,' said Holmes; 'this beauty has guessed Miss Hunter's intentions, and has carried his victim off.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33338' title='33338'>'But how?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33339' title='33339'>'Through the skylight. </span>
<span sid='33340' title='33340'>We shall soon see how he managed it.' </span>
<span sid='33341' title='33341'>He swung himself up on to the roof. </span>
<span sid='33342' title='33342'>'Ah, yes,' he cried, 'here's the end of a long light ladder against the eaves. </span>
<span sid='33343' title='33343'>That is how he did it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33344' title='33344'>'But it is impossible,' said Miss Hunter, 'the ladder was not there when the Rucastles went away.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33345' title='33345'>'He has come back and done it. </span>
<span sid='33346' title='33346'>I tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man. </span>
<span sid='33347' title='33347'>I should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step I hear now upon the stair. </span>
<span sid='33348' title='33348'>I think, Watson, that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33349' title='33349'>The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand. </span>
<span sid='33350' title='33350'>Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33351' title='33351'>'You villain!' said he, 'where's your daughter?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33352' title='33352'>The fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33353' title='33353'>'It is for me to ask you that,' he shrieked, 'you thieves! </span>
<span sid='33354' title='33354'>Spies and thieves! </span>
<span sid='33355' title='33355'>I have caught you, have I? </span>
<span sid='33356' title='33356'>You are in my power. </span>
<span sid='33357' title='33357'>I'll serve you!' </span>
<span sid='33358' title='33358'>He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33359' title='33359'>'He's gone for the dog!' cried Miss Hunter.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33360' title='33360'>'I have my revolver,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33361' title='33361'>'Better close the front door,' cried Holmes, and we all rushed down the stairs together. </span>
<span sid='33362' title='33362'>We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to. </span>
<span sid='33363' title='33363'>An elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33364' title='33364'>'My God!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='33365' title='33365'>'Someone has loosed the dog. </span>
<span sid='33366' title='33366'>It's not been fed for two days. </span>
<span sid='33367' title='33367'>Quick, quick, or it'll be too late!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33368' title='33368'>Holmes and I rushed out, and round the angle of the house, with Toller hurrying behind us. </span>
<span sid='33369' title='33369'>There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle buried in Rucastle's throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the ground. </span>
<span sid='33370' title='33370'>Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. </span>
<span sid='33371' title='33371'>With much labour we separated them, and carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. </span>
<span sid='33372' title='33372'>We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and having despatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to relieve his pain. </span>
<span sid='33373' title='33373'>We were all assembled round him when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt women entered the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33374' title='33374'>'Mrs Toller!' cried Miss Hunter.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33375' title='33375'>'Yes, miss. </span>
<span sid='33376' title='33376'>Mr Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you. </span>
<span sid='33377' title='33377'>Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn't let me know what you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33378' title='33378'>'Ha!' said Holmes, looking keenly at her. </span>
<span sid='33379' title='33379'>'It is clear that Mrs Toller knows more about this matter than anyone else.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33380' title='33380'>'Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33381' title='33381'>'Then pray sit down, and let us hear it, for there are several points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33382' title='33382'>'I will soon make it clear to you,' said she; 'and I'd have done so before now if I could ha' got out from the cellar. </span>
<span sid='33383' title='33383'>If there's police-court business over this, you'll remember that I was the one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice's friend too.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33384' title='33384'>'She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn't, from the time that her father married again. </span>
<span sid='33385' title='33385'>She was slighted like, and had no say in anything; but it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr Fowler at a friend's house. </span>
<span sid='33386' title='33386'>As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them, but just left everything in Mr Rucastle's hands. </span>
<span sid='33387' title='33387'>He knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law could give him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. </span>
<span sid='33388' title='33388'>He wanted her to sign a paper so that whether she married or not, he could use her money. </span>
<span sid='33389' title='33389'>When she wouldn't do it, he kept on worrying her until she got brain fever, and for six weeks was at death's door. </span>
<span sid='33390' title='33390'>Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but that didn't make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33391' title='33391'>'Ah,' said Holmes, 'I think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that remains. </span>
<span sid='33392' title='33392'>Mr Rucastle, then, I presume, took to this system of imprisonment?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33393' title='33393'>'Yes, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33394' title='33394'>'And brought Miss Hunter down from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr Fowler.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33395' title='33395'>'That was it, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33396' title='33396'>'But Mr Fowler, being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be, blockaded the house, and having met you, succeeded by certain arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same as his.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33397' title='33397'>'Mr Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,' said Mrs Toller serenely.</span>
<p>
<span sid='33398' title='33398'>'And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33399' title='33399'>'You have it, sir, just as it happened.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33400' title='33400'>'I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs Toller,' said Holmes, 'for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. </span>
<span sid='33401' title='33401'>And here comes the country surgeon and Mrs Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Winchester&t=h'>Winchester</a>, as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a questionable one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='33402' title='33402'>And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door. </span>
<span sid='33403' title='33403'>Mr Rucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife. </span>
<span sid='33404' title='33404'>They still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle's past life that he finds it difficult to part from them. </span>
<span sid='33405' title='33405'>Mr Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special licence, in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Southampton&t=h'>Southampton</a> the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a Government appointment in the Island of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Mauritius&t=h'>Mauritius</a>. </span>
<span sid='33406' title='33406'>As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Walsall&t=h'>Walsall</a>, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.</span>
