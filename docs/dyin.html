<p class="subtitle">Arthur Conan Doyle<label for="sn-meta-dyin" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-meta-dyin" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><!--googleoff: all--><b>Story Number</b>: 46<br><b>Published in</b>: The Collier's magazine, 22 November 1913 (US)<br><b>Collected in</b>: His Last Bow: Some Reminiscences of Sherlock Holmes<!--googleon: all--></span></p>
<p>
<span sid='29440' title='29440'>Mrs Hudson, the landlady of Sherlock Holmes, was a long-suffering woman. </span>
<span sid='29441' title='29441'>Not only was her first-floor flat invaded at all hours by throngs of singular and often undesirable characters, but her remarkable lodger showed an eccentricity and irregularity in his life which must have sorely tried her patience. </span>
<span sid='29442' title='29442'>His incredible untidiness, his addiction to music at strange hours, his occasional revolver practice within doors, his weird and often malodorous scientific experiments, and the atmosphere of violence and danger which hung around him made him the very worst tenant in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='29443' title='29443'>On the other hand his payments were princely. </span>
<span sid='29444' title='29444'>I have no doubt that the house might have been purchased at the price which Holmes paid for his rooms during the years that I was with him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29445' title='29445'>The landlady stood in the deepest awe of him, and never dared to interfere with him, however outrageous his proceedings might seem. </span>
<span sid='29446' title='29446'>She was fond of him too, for he had a remarkable gentleness and courtesy in his dealings with women. </span>
<span sid='29447' title='29447'>He disliked and distrusted the sex but he was always a chivalrous opponent. </span>
<span sid='29448' title='29448'>Knowing how genuine was her regard for him I listened earnestly to her story when she came to my rooms in the second year of my married life, and told me of the sad condition to which my poor friend was reduced.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29449' title='29449'>'He's dying, Dr Watson,' said she. </span>
<span sid='29450' title='29450'>'For three days he has been sinking and I doubt if he will last the day. </span>
<span sid='29451' title='29451'>He would not let me get a doctor. </span>
<span sid='29452' title='29452'>This morning when I saw his bones sticking out of his face and his great bright eyes looking at me I could stand no more of it. </span>
<span sid='29453' title='29453'>"With your leave or without it, Mr Holmes, I am going for a doctor this very hour," said I. </span>
<span sid='29454' title='29454'>"Let it be Watson then," said he. </span>
<span sid='29455' title='29455'>I wouldn't waste an hour in coming to him, sir, or you may not see him alive.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29456' title='29456'>I was horrified, for I had heard nothing of his illness. </span>
<span sid='29457' title='29457'>I need not say that I rushed for my coat and my hat. </span>
<span sid='29458' title='29458'>As we drove back I asked for the details.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29459' title='29459'>'There is little I can tell you, sir. </span>
<span sid='29460' title='29460'>He has been working at a case down at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Rotherhithe&t=h'>Rotherhithe</a> in an alley near the river and he has brought this illness back with him. </span>
<span sid='29461' title='29461'>He took to his bed on Wednesday afternoon and has never moved since. </span>
<span sid='29462' title='29462'>For these three days neither food nor drink have passed his lips.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29463' title='29463'>'Good God! </span>
<span sid='29464' title='29464'>Why did you not call in a doctor?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29465' title='29465'>'He wouldn't have it, sir. </span>
<span sid='29466' title='29466'>You know how masterful he is. </span>
<span sid='29467' title='29467'>I didn't dare to disobey him. </span>
<span sid='29468' title='29468'>But he's not long for this world as you'll see for yourself the moment that you set eyes on him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29469' title='29469'>He was indeed a deplorable spectacle. </span>
<span sid='29470' title='29470'>In the dim light of a foggy November day the sick-room was a gloomy spot, but it was that gaunt wasted face staring at me from the bed which sent a chill to my heart. </span>
<span sid='29471' title='29471'>His eyes had the brightness of fever, there was a hectic flush upon either cheek, and dark crusts clung to his lips. </span>
<span sid='29472' title='29472'>The thin hands upon the coverlet twitched incessantly. </span>
<span sid='29473' title='29473'>His voice was croaking and spasmodic. </span>
<span sid='29474' title='29474'>He lay listlessly as I entered the room but the sight of me brought a gleam of recognition to his eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29475' title='29475'>'Well, Watson, we seem to have fallen upon evil days,' said he in a feeble voice but with something of his old carelessness of manner.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29476' title='29476'>'My dear fellow-' I cried, approaching him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29477' title='29477'>'Stand back! </span>
<span sid='29478' title='29478'>Stand right back!' said he, with the sharp imperiousness which I had associated only with moments of crisis. </span>
<span sid='29479' title='29479'>'If you approach me, Watson, I shall order you out of the house.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29480' title='29480'>'But why?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29481' title='29481'>'Because it is my desire. </span>
<span sid='29482' title='29482'>Is that not enough?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29483' title='29483'>Yes, Mrs Hudson was right. </span>
<span sid='29484' title='29484'>He was more masterful than ever. </span>
<span sid='29485' title='29485'>It was pitiful however to see his exhaustion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29486' title='29486'>'I only wished to help' I explained.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29487' title='29487'>'Exactly You will help best by doing what you are told.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29488' title='29488'>'Certainly, Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29489' title='29489'>He relaxed the austerity of his manner.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29490' title='29490'>'You are not angry?' he asked, gasping for breath.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29491' title='29491'>Poor devil, how could I be angry when I saw him lying in such a plight before me?</span>
<p>
<span sid='29492' title='29492'>'It's for your own sake, Watson,' he croaked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29493' title='29493'>'For my sake?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29494' title='29494'>'I know what is the matter with me. </span>
<span sid='29495' title='29495'>It is a Coolie disease from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sumatra&t=h'>Sumatra</a> - a thing that the Dutch know more about than we, though, they have made little of it up to date. </span>
<span sid='29496' title='29496'>One thing only is certain. </span>
<span sid='29497' title='29497'>It is infallibly deadly and it is horribly contagious.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29498' title='29498'>He spoke now with a feverish energy, the long hands twitching and jerking as he motioned me away.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29499' title='29499'>'Contagious by touch, Watson - that's it, by touch. </span>
<span sid='29500' title='29500'>Keep your distance and all is well.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29501' title='29501'>'Good heavens, Holmes, do you suppose that such a consideration weighs with me for an instant? </span>
<span sid='29502' title='29502'>It would not affect me in the case of a stranger. </span>
<span sid='29503' title='29503'>Do you imagine it would prevent me from doing my duty to so old a friend?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29504' title='29504'>Again I advanced, but he repulsed me with a look of furious anger.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29505' title='29505'>'If you will stand there I will talk. </span>
<span sid='29506' title='29506'>If you do not you must leave the room.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29507' title='29507'>I have so deep a respect for the extraordinary qualities of Holmes that I have always deferred to his wishes even when I least understood them. </span>
<span sid='29508' title='29508'>But now all my professional instincts were aroused. </span>
<span sid='29509' title='29509'>Let him be my master elsewhere, I at least was his in a sick-room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29510' title='29510'>'Holmes,' said I, 'you are not yourself. </span>
<span sid='29511' title='29511'>A sick man is but a child and so I will treat you. </span>
<span sid='29512' title='29512'>Whether you like it or not, I will examine your symptoms and treat you for them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29513' title='29513'>He looked at me with venomous eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29514' title='29514'>'If I am to have a doctor whether I will or not let me at least have something in which I have confidence,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29515' title='29515'>'Then you have none in me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29516' title='29516'>'In your friendship certainly. </span>
<span sid='29517' title='29517'>But facts are facts, Watson, and after all you are only a general practitioner with very limited experience and mediocre qualifications. </span>
<span sid='29518' title='29518'>It is painful to have to say these things but you leave me no choice.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29519' title='29519'>I was bitterly hurt.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29520' title='29520'>'Such a remark is unworthy of you, Holmes. </span>
<span sid='29521' title='29521'>It shows me very clearly the state of your own nerves. </span>
<span sid='29522' title='29522'>But if you have no confidence in me I would not intrude my services. </span>
<span sid='29523' title='29523'>Let me bring Sir Jasper Meek or Penrose Fisher or any of the best men in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='29524' title='29524'>But someone you must have, and that is final. </span>
<span sid='29525' title='29525'>If you think that I am going to stand here and see you die without either helping you myself or bringing anyone else to help you, then you have mistaken your man.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29526' title='29526'>'You mean well, Watson! said the sick man, with something between a sob and a groan. </span>
<span sid='29527' title='29527'>'Shall I demonstrate your own ignorance? </span>
<span sid='29528' title='29528'>What do you know pray of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Tapanuli&t=h'>Tapanuli</a> fever? </span>
<span sid='29529' title='29529'>What do you know of the black Formosa corruption?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29530' title='29530'>'I have never heard of either.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29531' title='29531'>'There are many problems of disease, many strange pathological possibilities, in the East, Watson.' </span>
<span sid='29532' title='29532'>He paused after each sentence to collect his failing strength. </span>
<span sid='29533' title='29533'>'I have learned as much during some recent researches which have a medico-criminal aspect. </span>
<span sid='29534' title='29534'>It was in the course of them that I contracted this complaint. </span>
<span sid='29535' title='29535'>You can do nothing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29536' title='29536'>'Possibly not. </span>
<span sid='29537' title='29537'>But I happen to know that Dr Ainstree, the greatest living authority upon tropical disease is now in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='29538' title='29538'>All remonstrance is useless, Holmes. </span>
<span sid='29539' title='29539'>I am going this instant to fetch him.' </span>
<span sid='29540' title='29540'>I turned resolutely to the door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29541' title='29541'>Never have I had such a shock. </span>
<span sid='29542' title='29542'>In an instant with a tiger-spring the dying man had intercepted me. </span>
<span sid='29543' title='29543'>I heard the sharp snap of a twisted key. </span>
<span sid='29544' title='29544'>The next moment he had staggered back to his bed exhausted and panting after his one tremendous outflame of energy.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29545' title='29545'>'You won't take the key from me by force, Watson. </span>
<span sid='29546' title='29546'>I've got you, my friend. </span>
<span sid='29547' title='29547'>Here you are and here you will stay until I will otherwise. </span>
<span sid='29548' title='29548'>But I'll humour you.' </span>
<span sid='29549' title='29549'>(All this in little gasps with terrible struggles for breath between.) </span>
<span sid='29550' title='29550'>'You've only my own good at heart. </span>
<span sid='29551' title='29551'>Of course I know that very well. </span>
<span sid='29552' title='29552'>You shall have your way. </span>
<span sid='29553' title='29553'>But give me time to get my strength. </span>
<span sid='29554' title='29554'>Not now, Watson - not now. </span>
<span sid='29555' title='29555'>It's four o'clock. </span>
<span sid='29556' title='29556'>At six you can go.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29557' title='29557'>'This is insanity, Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29558' title='29558'>'Only two hours, Watson, I promise you will go at six. </span>
<span sid='29559' title='29559'>Are you content to wait?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29560' title='29560'>'I seem to have no choice.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29561' title='29561'>'None in the world, Watson. </span>
<span sid='29562' title='29562'>Thank you I need no help in arranging the clothes. </span>
<span sid='29563' title='29563'>You will please keep your distance. </span>
<span sid='29564' title='29564'>Now, Watson, there is one other condition that I would make. </span>
<span sid='29565' title='29565'>You will seek help not from the man you mention but from the one that I choose.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29566' title='29566'>'By all means.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29567' title='29567'>'The first three sensible words that you have uttered since you entered this room, Watson. </span>
<span sid='29568' title='29568'>You will find some books over there. </span>
<span sid='29569' title='29569'>I am somewhat exhausted. </span>
<span sid='29570' title='29570'>I wonder how a battery feels when it pours electricity into a non-conductor. </span>
<span sid='29571' title='29571'>At six, Watson, we resume our conversation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29572' title='29572'>But it was destined to be resumed long before that hour and under circumstances which gave me a shock hardly second to that caused by his spring to the door. </span>
<span sid='29573' title='29573'>I had stood for some minutes looking at the silent figure in the bed. </span>
<span sid='29574' title='29574'>His face was almost covered by the clothes and he appeared to be asleep. </span>
<span sid='29575' title='29575'>Then, unable to settle down to reading, I walked slowly round the room, examining the pictures of celebrated criminals with which every wall was adorned. </span>
<span sid='29576' title='29576'>Finally, in my aimless perambulation, I came to the mantelpiece. </span>
<span sid='29577' title='29577'>A litter of pipes, tobacco-pouches, syringes, penknives, revolver cartridges, and other debris was scattered over it. </span>
<span sid='29578' title='29578'>In the midst of these was a small black and white ivory box with a sliding lid. </span>
<span sid='29579' title='29579'>It was a neat little thing, and I had stretched out my hand to examine it more closely, when-</span>
<p>
<span sid='29580' title='29580'>It was a dreadful cry that he gave - a yell which might have been heard down the street. </span>
<span sid='29581' title='29581'>My skin went cold and my hair bristled at that horrible scream. </span>
<span sid='29582' title='29582'>As I turned I caught a glimpse of a convulsed face and frantic eyes. </span>
<span sid='29583' title='29583'>I stood paralysed, with the little box in my hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29584' title='29584'>'Put it down! </span>
<span sid='29585' title='29585'>Down, this instant, Watson, this instant, I say!' </span>
<span sid='29586' title='29586'>His head sank back upon the pillow and he gave a deep sigh of relief as I replaced the box upon the mantelpiece. </span>
<span sid='29587' title='29587'>'I hate to have my things touched, Watson. </span>
<span sid='29588' title='29588'>You know that I hate it. </span>
<span sid='29589' title='29589'>You fidget me beyond endurance. </span>
<span sid='29590' title='29590'>You a doctor - you are enough to drive a patient into an asylum. </span>
<span sid='29591' title='29591'>Sit down, man, and let me have my rest!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29592' title='29592'>The incident left a most unpleasant impression upon my mind. </span>
<span sid='29593' title='29593'>The violent and causeless excitement, followed by this brutality of speech, so far removed from his usual suavity, showed me how deep was the disorganization of his mind. </span>
<span sid='29594' title='29594'>Of all ruins that of a noble mind is the most deplorable. </span>
<span sid='29595' title='29595'>I sat in silent dejection until the stipulated time had passed. </span>
<span sid='29596' title='29596'>He seemed to have been watching the clock, as well as I, for it was hardly six before he began to talk with the same feverish animation as before.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29597' title='29597'>'Now, Watson,' said he. </span>
<span sid='29598' title='29598'>'Have you any change in your pocket?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29599' title='29599'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29600' title='29600'>'Any silver?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29601' title='29601'>'A good deal.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29602' title='29602'>'How many half-crowns?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29603' title='29603'>'I have five.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29604' title='29604'>'Ah, too few! too few! </span>
<span sid='29605' title='29605'>How very unfortunate, Watson! </span>
<span sid='29606' title='29606'>However such as they are you can put them in your watch-pocket. </span>
<span sid='29607' title='29607'>And all the rest of your money in your left trowser-pocket. </span>
<span sid='29608' title='29608'>Thank you. </span>
<span sid='29609' title='29609'>It will balance you so much better like that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29610' title='29610'>This was raving insanity. </span>
<span sid='29611' title='29611'>He shuddered and again made a sound between a cough and a sob.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29612' title='29612'>'You will now light the gas, Watson, but you will be very careful that not for one instant shall it be more than half on. </span>
<span sid='29613' title='29613'>I implore you to be careful, Watson. </span>
<span sid='29614' title='29614'>Thank you, that is excellent. </span>
<span sid='29615' title='29615'>No, you need not draw the blind. </span>
<span sid='29616' title='29616'>Now you will have the kindness to place some letters and papers upon this table within my reach. </span>
<span sid='29617' title='29617'>Thank you. </span>
<span sid='29618' title='29618'>Now some of that litter from the mantelpiece. </span>
<span sid='29619' title='29619'>Excellent, Watson! </span>
<span sid='29620' title='29620'>There is a sugar-tongs there. </span>
<span sid='29621' title='29621'>Kindly raise that small ivory box with its assistance. </span>
<span sid='29622' title='29622'>Place it here among the papers. </span>
<span sid='29623' title='29623'>Good! </span>
<span sid='29624' title='29624'>You can now go and fetch Mr Culverton Smith of 13 lower Burke Street.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29625' title='29625'>To tell the truth my desire to fetch a doctor had somewhat weakened, for poor Holmes was so obviously delirious that it seemed dangerous to leave him. </span>
<span sid='29626' title='29626'>However, he was as eager now to consult the person named as he had been obstinate in refusing.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29627' title='29627'>'I never heard the name,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29628' title='29628'>'Possibly not, my good Watson. </span>
<span sid='29629' title='29629'>It may surprise you to know that the man upon earth who is best versed in this disease is not a medical man but a planter. </span>
<span sid='29630' title='29630'>Mr Culverton Smith is a well-known resident of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sumatra&t=h'>Sumatra</a>, now visiting <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='29631' title='29631'>An outbreak of the disease upon his plantation which was far absent from medical aid, caused him to study it himself with some rather far-reaching consequences. </span>
<span sid='29632' title='29632'>He is a very methodical person and I did not desire you to start before six because I was well aware that you would not find him in his study. </span>
<span sid='29633' title='29633'>If you could persuade him to come here and give us the benefit of his unique experience of this disease, the investigation of which has been his dearest hobby, I cannot doubt that he could help me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29634' title='29634'>I give Holmes's remarks as a consecutive whole and will not attempt to indicate how they were interrupted by gaspings for breath and those clutchings of his hands which indicated the pain from which he was suffering. </span>
<span sid='29635' title='29635'>His appearance had changed for the worse during the few hours that I had been with him. </span>
<span sid='29636' title='29636'>Those hectic spots were more pronounced, the eyes shone more brightly out of darker hollows, and a cold sweat glimmered upon his brow. </span>
<span sid='29637' title='29637'>He still retained however the jaunty gallantry of his speech. </span>
<span sid='29638' title='29638'>To the last gasp he would always be the master.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29639' title='29639'>'You will tell him exactly how you have left me,' said he. </span>
<span sid='29640' title='29640'>'You will convey the very impression which is in your own mind. </span>
<span sid='29641' title='29641'>A dying man - a dying and delirious man. </span>
<span sid='29642' title='29642'>Indeed I cannot think why the whole bed of the ocean is not one solid mass of oysters, so prolific the creatures seem. </span>
<span sid='29643' title='29643'>Ah, I am wandering! </span>
<span sid='29644' title='29644'>Strange how the brain controls the brain! </span>
<span sid='29645' title='29645'>What was I saying, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29646' title='29646'>'My directions for Mr Culverton Smith.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29647' title='29647'>'Ah yes, I remember. </span>
<span sid='29648' title='29648'>My life depends upon it. </span>
<span sid='29649' title='29649'>Plead with him, Watson. </span>
<span sid='29650' title='29650'>There is no good feeling between us. </span>
<span sid='29651' title='29651'>His nephew, Watson - I had suspicions of foul play and I allowed him to see it. </span>
<span sid='29652' title='29652'>The boy died horribly. </span>
<span sid='29653' title='29653'>He has a grudge against me. </span>
<span sid='29654' title='29654'>You will soften him, Watson. </span>
<span sid='29655' title='29655'>Beg him, pray him, get him here by any means. </span>
<span sid='29656' title='29656'>He can save me - only he.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29657' title='29657'>'I will bring him in a cab, if I have to carry him down to it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29658' title='29658'>'You will do nothing of the sort. </span>
<span sid='29659' title='29659'>You will persuade him to come. </span>
<span sid='29660' title='29660'>And then you will return in front of him. </span>
<span sid='29661' title='29661'>Make any excuse so as not to come with him. </span>
<span sid='29662' title='29662'>Don't forget, Watson. </span>
<span sid='29663' title='29663'>You won't fail me. </span>
<span sid='29664' title='29664'>You never did fail me. </span>
<span sid='29665' title='29665'>No doubt there are natural enemies which limit the increase of the creatures. </span>
<span sid='29666' title='29666'>You and I, Watson, we have done our part. </span>
<span sid='29667' title='29667'>Shall the world then be overrun by oysters. </span>
<span sid='29668' title='29668'>No, no, horrible! </span>
<span sid='29669' title='29669'>You'll convey all that is in your mind.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29670' title='29670'>I left him full of the image of this magnificent intellect babbling like a foolish child. </span>
<span sid='29671' title='29671'>He had handed me the key and with a happy thought I took it with me lest he should lock himself in. </span>
<span sid='29672' title='29672'>Mrs Hudson was waiting trembling and weeping in the passage. </span>
<span sid='29673' title='29673'>Behind me as I passed from the flat I heard Holmes's high thin voice in some delirious chant. </span>
<span sid='29674' title='29674'>Below as I stood whistling for a cab a man came on me through the fog.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29675' title='29675'>'How is Mr Holmes, sir?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29676' title='29676'>It was an old acquaintance, Inspector Morton of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>, dressed in unofficial tweeds.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29677' title='29677'>'He is very ill,' I answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29678' title='29678'>He looked at me in a most singular fashion. </span>
<span sid='29679' title='29679'>Had it not been too fiendish I could have imagined that the gleam of the fanlight showed exultation in his face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29680' title='29680'>'I heard some rumour of it,' said he. </span>
<span sid='29681' title='29681'>The cab had driven up and I left him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29682' title='29682'>Lower Burke Street proved to be a line of fine houses lying in the vague borderland between <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Notting Hill&t=h'>Notting Hill</a> and <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kensington&t=h'>Kensington</a>. </span>
<span sid='29683' title='29683'>The particular one at which my cabman pulled up had an air of smug and demure respectability in its old-fashioned iron railings, its massive folding-door and its shining brasswork. </span>
<span sid='29684' title='29684'>All was in keeping with a solemn butler who appeared framed in the pink radiance of a tinted electric light behind him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29685' title='29685'>'Yes, Mr Culverton Smith is in. </span>
<span sid='29686' title='29686'>Dr Watson! </span>
<span sid='29687' title='29687'>Very good, sir, I will take up your card.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29688' title='29688'>My humble name and tide did not appear to impress Mr Culverton Smith. </span>
<span sid='29689' title='29689'>Through the half-open door I heard a high, petulant, penetrating voice.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29690' title='29690'>'Who is this person? </span>
<span sid='29691' title='29691'>What does he want? </span>
<span sid='29692' title='29692'>Dear me, Staples, how often have I said that I am not to be disturbed in my hours of study!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29693' title='29693'>There came a gentle flow of soothing explanation from the buder.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29694' title='29694'>'Well I won't see him, Staples. </span>
<span sid='29695' title='29695'>I can't have my work interrupted like this. </span>
<span sid='29696' title='29696'>I am not at home. </span>
<span sid='29697' title='29697'>Say so. </span>
<span sid='29698' title='29698'>Tell him to come in the morning if he really must see me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29699' title='29699'>Again the gentle murmur.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29700' title='29700'>'Well, well, give him that message. </span>
<span sid='29701' title='29701'>He can come in the morning, or he can stay away. </span>
<span sid='29702' title='29702'>My work must not be hindered.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29703' title='29703'>I thought of Holmes tossing upon his bed of sickness, and counting the minutes perhaps until I should bring help to him. </span>
<span sid='29704' title='29704'>It was not a time to stand upon ceremony. </span>
<span sid='29705' title='29705'>His life depended upon my promptness. </span>
<span sid='29706' title='29706'>Before the apologetic buder had delivered his message I had pushed past him and was in the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29707' title='29707'>With a shrill cry of anger a man rose from a reclining chair beside the fire. </span>
<span sid='29708' title='29708'>I saw a great yellow face, coarse-grained and greasy, with heavy, double chins, and two sullen menacing grey eyes, which glared at me from under tufted and sandy brows. </span>
<span sid='29709' title='29709'>A high bald head had a small velvet smoking-cap poised coquettishly upon one side of its pink curve. </span>
<span sid='29710' title='29710'>The skull was of enormous capacity, and yet as I looked down I saw to my amazement that the figure of the man was small and frail, twisted in the shoulders and back like one who has suffered from rickets in his childhood.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29711' title='29711'>'What's this?' he cried in a high screaming voice. </span>
<span sid='29712' title='29712'>'What is the meaning of this intrusion? </span>
<span sid='29713' title='29713'>Didn't I send you word that I would see you to-morrow morning?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29714' title='29714'>'I am sorry,' said I, 'but the matter cannot be delayed. </span>
<span sid='29715' title='29715'>Mr Sherlock Holmes-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29716' title='29716'>The mention of my friend's name had an extraordinary effect upon the little man. </span>
<span sid='29717' title='29717'>The look of anger passed in an instant from his face. </span>
<span sid='29718' title='29718'>His features became tense and alert.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29719' title='29719'>'Have you come from Holmes?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29720' title='29720'>'I have just left him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29721' title='29721'>'What about Holmes? </span>
<span sid='29722' title='29722'>How is he?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29723' title='29723'>'He is desperately ill. </span>
<span sid='29724' title='29724'>That is why I have come.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29725' title='29725'>The man motioned me to a chair, and turned to resume his own. </span>
<span sid='29726' title='29726'>As he did so I caught a glimpse of his face in the mirror over the mantelpiece. </span>
<span sid='29727' title='29727'>I could have sworn that it was set in a malicious and abominable smile. </span>
<span sid='29728' title='29728'>Yet I persuaded myself that it must have been some nervous contraction which I had surprised, for he turned to me an instant later with genuine concern upon his features.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29729' title='29729'>'I am sorry to hear this,' said he. </span>
<span sid='29730' title='29730'>'I only know Mr Holmes through some business dealings which we have had, but I have every respect for his talents and his character. </span>
<span sid='29731' title='29731'>He is an amateur of crime, as I am of disease. </span>
<span sid='29732' title='29732'>For him the villain, for me the microbe. </span>
<span sid='29733' title='29733'>There are my prisons,' he continued, pointing to a row of bottles and jars which stood upon a side table. </span>
<span sid='29734' title='29734'>'Among these gelatine cultivations some of the very worst offenders in the world are now doing time.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29735' title='29735'>'It was on account of your special knowledge that Mr Holmes desired to see you. </span>
<span sid='29736' title='29736'>He has a high opinion of you and thought that you were the one man in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> who could help him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29737' title='29737'>The little man started, and the jaunty smoking-cap slid to the floor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29738' title='29738'>'Why?' he asked. </span>
<span sid='29739' title='29739'>'Why should Mr Holmes think that I could help him in his trouble?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29740' title='29740'>'Because of your knowledge of Eastern diseases.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29741' title='29741'>'But why should be think that this disease which he has contracted is Eastern?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29742' title='29742'>'Because in some professional inquiry he has been working among Chinese sailors down in the Docks.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29743' title='29743'>Mr Culverton Smith smiled pleasantly and picked up his smoking-cap.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29744' title='29744'>'Oh, that's it, is it?' said he. </span>
<span sid='29745' title='29745'>'I trust the matter is not so grave as you suppose. </span>
<span sid='29746' title='29746'>How long has he been ill?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29747' title='29747'>'About three days.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29748' title='29748'>'Is he delirious?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29749' title='29749'>'Occasionally.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29750' title='29750'>'Tut, tut! </span>
<span sid='29751' title='29751'>This sounds serious. </span>
<span sid='29752' title='29752'>It would be inhuman not to answer his call. </span>
<span sid='29753' title='29753'>I very much resent any interruption to my work, Dr Watson, but this case is certainly exceptional. </span>
<span sid='29754' title='29754'>I win come with you at once.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29755' title='29755'>I remembered Holmes's injunction.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29756' title='29756'>'I have another appointment,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29757' title='29757'>'Very good. </span>
<span sid='29758' title='29758'>I will go alone. </span>
<span sid='29759' title='29759'>I have a note of Mr Holmes's address. </span>
<span sid='29760' title='29760'>You can rely upon my being there within half an hour at most.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29761' title='29761'>It was with a sinking heart that I re-entered Holmes's bedroom. </span>
<span sid='29762' title='29762'>For all that I knew the worst might have happened in my absence. </span>
<span sid='29763' title='29763'>To my enormous relief he had improved greatly in the interval. </span>
<span sid='29764' title='29764'>His appearance was as ghastly as ever, but all trace of delirium had left him and he spoke in a feeble voice it is true but with even more than his usual crispness and lucidity.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29765' title='29765'>'Well, did you see him, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29766' title='29766'>'Yes, he is coming.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29767' title='29767'>'Admirable, Watson, Admirable! </span>
<span sid='29768' title='29768'>You are the best of messengers.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29769' title='29769'>'He wished to return with me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29770' title='29770'>'That would never do, Watson. </span>
<span sid='29771' title='29771'>That would be obviously impossible. </span>
<span sid='29772' title='29772'>Did he ask what ailed me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29773' title='29773'>'I told him about the Chinese in the East-end.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29774' title='29774'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='29775' title='29775'>Well, Watson, you have done all that a good friend could. </span>
<span sid='29776' title='29776'>You can now disappear from the scene.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29777' title='29777'>'I must wait and hear his opinion, Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29778' title='29778'>'Of course you must. </span>
<span sid='29779' title='29779'>But I have reasons to suppose that this opinion would be very much more frank and valuable if he imagines that we are alone. </span>
<span sid='29780' title='29780'>There is just room behind the head of my bed, Watson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29781' title='29781'>'My dear Holmes!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29782' title='29782'>'I fear there is no alternative, Watson. </span>
<span sid='29783' title='29783'>The room does not lend itself to concealment which is as well as it is the less likely to arouse suspicion. </span>
<span sid='29784' title='29784'>But just there, Watson, I fancy that it could be done.' </span>
<span sid='29785' title='29785'>Suddenly he sat up with a rigid intentness upon his haggard face. </span>
<span sid='29786' title='29786'>'There are the wheels, Watson. </span>
<span sid='29787' title='29787'>Quick man, if you love me! </span>
<span sid='29788' title='29788'>And don't budge, whatever happens - whatever happens, do you hear? </span>
<span sid='29789' title='29789'>Don't speak! </span>
<span sid='29790' title='29790'>Don't move! just listen with all your ears.' </span>
<span sid='29791' title='29791'>Then in an instant his sudden access of strength departed and his masterful purposeful talk droned away into the low vague murmurings of a semi-delirious man.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29792' title='29792'>From the hiding-place into which I had been so swiftly hustled I heard the footfalls upon the stair, with the opening and the closing of the bedroom door. </span>
<span sid='29793' title='29793'>Then to my surprise there came a long silence broken only by the heavy breathings and gaspings of the sick man. </span>
<span sid='29794' title='29794'>I could imagine that our visitor was standing by the bedside and looking down at the sufferer. </span>
<span sid='29795' title='29795'>At last that strange hush was broken.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29796' title='29796'>'Holmes!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='29797' title='29797'>'Holmes!' in the insistent tone of one who awakens a sleeper. </span>
<span sid='29798' title='29798'>'Can't you hear me, Holmes!' </span>
<span sid='29799' title='29799'>There was a rustling as if he had shaken the sick man roughly by the shoulder.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29800' title='29800'>'Is that you, Mr Smith?' Holmes whispered. </span>
<span sid='29801' title='29801'>'I hardly dared hope that you would come.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29802' title='29802'>The other laughed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29803' title='29803'>'I should imagine not,' he said. </span>
<span sid='29804' title='29804'>'And yet, you see, I am here. </span>
<span sid='29805' title='29805'>Coals of fire, Holmes - coals of fire!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29806' title='29806'>'It is very good of you - very noble of you. </span>
<span sid='29807' title='29807'>I appreciate your special knowledge.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29808' title='29808'>Our visitor sniggered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29809' title='29809'>'You do. </span>
<span sid='29810' title='29810'>You are fortunately the only man in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> who does. </span>
<span sid='29811' title='29811'>Do you know what is the matter with you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29812' title='29812'>'The same,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29813' title='29813'>'Ah, you recognize the symptoms?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29814' title='29814'>'Only too well.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29815' title='29815'>'Well, I shouldn't be surprised, Holmes - I shouldn't be surprised if it were the same. </span>
<span sid='29816' title='29816'>A bad look-out for you if it is. </span>
<span sid='29817' title='29817'>Poor Victor was a dead man on the fourth day - a strong hearty young fellow. </span>
<span sid='29818' title='29818'>It was certainly, as you said, very surprising that he should have contracted an out-of-the-way Asiatic disease in the heart of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> - a disease too of which I had made such a very special study. </span>
<span sid='29819' title='29819'>Singular coincidence, Holmes. </span>
<span sid='29820' title='29820'>Very smart of you to notice it, but rather uncharitable to suggest that it was cause and effect.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29821' title='29821'>'I knew that you did it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29822' title='29822'>'Oh you did, did you? </span>
<span sid='29823' title='29823'>Well, you couldn't prove it anyhow. </span>
<span sid='29824' title='29824'>But what do you think of yourself spreading reports about me like that, and then crawling to me for help the moment you are in trouble? </span>
<span sid='29825' title='29825'>What sort of a game is that - eh?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29826' title='29826'>I heard the rasping laboured breathing of the sick man. </span>
<span sid='29827' title='29827'>'Give me the water!' he gasped.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29828' title='29828'>'You're precious near your end, my friend, but I don't want you to go till I have had a word with you. </span>
<span sid='29829' title='29829'>That's why I give you water. </span>
<span sid='29830' title='29830'>There, don't slop it about! </span>
<span sid='29831' title='29831'>That's right. </span>
<span sid='29832' title='29832'>Can you understand what I say?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29833' title='29833'>Holmes groaned.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29834' title='29834'>'Do what you can for me. </span>
<span sid='29835' title='29835'>Let bygones be bygones' he whispered. </span>
<span sid='29836' title='29836'>I'll put the words out of my head - I swear I will. </span>
<span sid='29837' title='29837'>Only cure me and I'll forget it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29838' title='29838'>'Forget what?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29839' title='29839'>'Well, about Victor Savage's death. </span>
<span sid='29840' title='29840'>You as good as admitted just now that you had done it. </span>
<span sid='29841' title='29841'>I'll forget it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29842' title='29842'>'You can forget it or remember it, just as you like. </span>
<span sid='29843' title='29843'>I don't see you in the witness box. </span>
<span sid='29844' title='29844'>Quite another shaped box, my good Holmes, I assure you. </span>
<span sid='29845' title='29845'>It matters nothing to me that you should know how my nephew died. </span>
<span sid='29846' title='29846'>It's not him we are talking about. </span>
<span sid='29847' title='29847'>It's you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29848' title='29848'>'Yes, Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29849' title='29849'>'The fellow who came for me - I've forgotten his name-said that you contracted it down in the East-end among the sailors.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29850' title='29850'>'I could only account for it so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29851' title='29851'>'You are proud of your brains, Holmes, are you not? </span>
<span sid='29852' title='29852'>Think yourself smart, don't you? </span>
<span sid='29853' title='29853'>You came across someone who was smarter this time. </span>
<span sid='29854' title='29854'>Now cast your mind back, Holmes. </span>
<span sid='29855' title='29855'>Can you think of no other way you could have got this thing?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29856' title='29856'>'I can't think. </span>
<span sid='29857' title='29857'>My mind is gone. </span>
<span sid='29858' title='29858'>For heavens sake help me!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29859' title='29859'>Yes, I will help you. </span>
<span sid='29860' title='29860'>I'll help you to understand just where you are and how you got there. </span>
<span sid='29861' title='29861'>I'd like you to know before you die.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29862' title='29862'>'Give me something to ease my pain.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29863' title='29863'>'Painful is it? </span>
<span sid='29864' title='29864'>Yes, the coolies used to do some squealing towards the end. </span>
<span sid='29865' title='29865'>Takes you as cramp, I fancy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29866' title='29866'>'Yes, yes, it is cramp.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29867' title='29867'>'Well, you can hear what I say anyhow. </span>
<span sid='29868' title='29868'>Listen now. </span>
<span sid='29869' title='29869'>Can you remember any unusual incident in your life just about the time your symptoms began?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29870' title='29870'>'No, no, nothing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29871' title='29871'>'Think again.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29872' title='29872'>'I'm too ill to think.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29873' title='29873'>'Well then, I'll help you. </span>
<span sid='29874' title='29874'>Did anything come by post?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29875' title='29875'>'By post?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29876' title='29876'>'A box by chance?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29877' title='29877'>'I'm fainting. </span>
<span sid='29878' title='29878'>I'm gone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29879' title='29879'>'Listen, Holmes!' </span>
<span sid='29880' title='29880'>There was a sound as if he was shaking the dying man, and it was all that I could do to hold myself quiet in my hiding-place. </span>
<span sid='29881' title='29881'>'You must hear me. </span>
<span sid='29882' title='29882'>You shall hear me. </span>
<span sid='29883' title='29883'>Do you remember a box - an ivory box? </span>
<span sid='29884' title='29884'>It came on Wednesday. </span>
<span sid='29885' title='29885'>You opened it - do you remember?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29886' title='29886'>'Yes, yes, I opened it. </span>
<span sid='29887' title='29887'>There was a sharp spring inside it. </span>
<span sid='29888' title='29888'>Some joke-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29889' title='29889'>'It was no joke as you will find to your cost. </span>
<span sid='29890' title='29890'>You fool, you would have it and you have got it. </span>
<span sid='29891' title='29891'>Who asked you to cross my path? </span>
<span sid='29892' title='29892'>If you had left me alone I would not have hurt you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29893' title='29893'>'I remember,' Holmes gasped. </span>
<span sid='29894' title='29894'>'The spring! </span>
<span sid='29895' title='29895'>It drew blood. </span>
<span sid='29896' title='29896'>This box - this on the table.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29897' title='29897'>'The very one, by George, and it may as well leave the room in my pocket. </span>
<span sid='29898' title='29898'>There goes your last shred of evidence. </span>
<span sid='29899' title='29899'>But you have the truth now, Holmes, and you can die with the knowledge that I killed you. </span>
<span sid='29900' title='29900'>You knew too much of the fate of Victor Savage, so I have sent you to share it. </span>
<span sid='29901' title='29901'>You are very near your end, Holmes. </span>
<span sid='29902' title='29902'>I will sit here and I will watch you die.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29903' title='29903'>Holmes's voice had sunk to an almost inaudible whisper.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29904' title='29904'>'What is that?' said Smith. </span>
<span sid='29905' title='29905'>'Turn up the gas. </span>
<span sid='29906' title='29906'>Ah, the shadows begin to fall, do they? </span>
<span sid='29907' title='29907'>Yes, I will turn it up, that I may see you the better.' </span>
<span sid='29908' title='29908'>He crossed the room and the light suddenly brightened. </span>
<span sid='29909' title='29909'>'Is there any other little service that I can do you, my friend?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29910' title='29910'>'A match and a cigarette.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29911' title='29911'>I nearly called out in my joy and my amazement. </span>
<span sid='29912' title='29912'>He was speaking in his natural voice - a little weak perhaps but the very voice I knew. </span>
<span sid='29913' title='29913'>There was a long pause and I felt that Culverton Smith was standing in silent amazement looking down at his companion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29914' title='29914'>'What's the meaning of this?' </span>
<span sid='29915' title='29915'>I heard him say at last in a dry rasping tone.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29916' title='29916'>'The best way of successfully acting a part is to be it,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='29917' title='29917'>'I give you my word that for three days I have tasted neither food, nor drink, until you were good enough to pour me out that glass of water. </span>
<span sid='29918' title='29918'>But it is the tobacco which I find most irksome. </span>
<span sid='29919' title='29919'>Ah, here are some cigarettes.' </span>
<span sid='29920' title='29920'>I heard the striking of a match. </span>
<span sid='29921' title='29921'>'That is very much better. </span>
<span sid='29922' title='29922'>Hullo, hullo, do I hear the step of a friend?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29923' title='29923'>There were footfalls outside, the door opened and Inspector Morton appeared.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29924' title='29924'>'All is in order and this is your man' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29925' title='29925'>The officer gave the usual cautions.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29926' title='29926'>'I arrest you on the charge of the murder of one Victor Savage,' he concluded.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29927' title='29927'>'And you might add of the attempted murder of one Sherlock Holmes' remarked my friend with a chuckle. </span>
<span sid='29928' title='29928'>'To save an invalid trouble, Inspector, Mr Culverton Smith was good enough to give our signal by turning up the gas. </span>
<span sid='29929' title='29929'>By the way the prisoner has a small box in the right-hand pocket of his coat which it would be as well to remove. </span>
<span sid='29930' title='29930'>Thank you! </span>
<span sid='29931' title='29931'>I would handle it gingerly if I were you. </span>
<span sid='29932' title='29932'>Put it down here. </span>
<span sid='29933' title='29933'>It may play its part in the trial.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29934' title='29934'>There was a sudden rush and a scuffle, followed by the clash of iron and a cry of pain.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29935' title='29935'>'You'll only get yourself hurt,' said the Inspector. </span>
<span sid='29936' title='29936'>'Stand still, will you?' </span>
<span sid='29937' title='29937'>There was the click of the closing handcuffs.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29938' title='29938'>'A nice trap!' cried the high snarling voice. </span>
<span sid='29939' title='29939'>'It will bring you into the dock, Holmes, not me. </span>
<span sid='29940' title='29940'>He asked me to come here to cure him. </span>
<span sid='29941' title='29941'>I was sorry for him and I came. </span>
<span sid='29942' title='29942'>Now he will pretend no doubt that I have said anything which he may invent which will corroborate his insane suspicions. </span>
<span sid='29943' title='29943'>You can lie as you like, Holmes. </span>
<span sid='29944' title='29944'>My word is always as good as yours.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29945' title='29945'>'Good heavens!' cried Holmes. </span>
<span sid='29946' title='29946'>'I had totally forgotten him. </span>
<span sid='29947' title='29947'>My dear Watson, I owe you a thousand apologies. </span>
<span sid='29948' title='29948'>To think that I should have overlooked you! </span>
<span sid='29949' title='29949'>I need not introduce you to Mr Culverton Smith since I understand that you met somewhat earlier in the evening. </span>
<span sid='29950' title='29950'>Have you the cab below. </span>
<span sid='29951' title='29951'>I will follow you when I am dressed for I may be of some use at the Station.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29952' title='29952'>'I never needed it more,' said Holmes, as he refreshed himself with a glass of claret and some biscuits in the intervals of his toilet. </span>
<span sid='29953' title='29953'>'However, as you know, my habits are irregular, and such a feat means less to me than to most men. </span>
<span sid='29954' title='29954'>It was very essential that I should impress Mrs Hudson with the reality of my condition since she was to convey it to you, and you in turn to him. </span>
<span sid='29955' title='29955'>You won't be offended, Watson you will realize that among your many talents dissimulation finds no place, and that if you had shared my secret you would never have been able to impress Smith with the urgent necessity of his presence, which was the vital point of the whole scheme. </span>
<span sid='29956' title='29956'>Knowing his vindictive nature I was perfectly certain that he would come to look upon his handiwork.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29957' title='29957'>'But your appearance, Holmes - your ghastly face?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29958' title='29958'>'Three days of absolute fast does not improve one's beauty, Watson. </span>
<span sid='29959' title='29959'>For the rest there is nothing which a sponge may not cure. </span>
<span sid='29960' title='29960'>With vaseline upon one's forehead, belladonna in one's eyes, rouge over the cheek-bones, and crusts of beeswax round one's lips a very satisfying effect can be produced. </span>
<span sid='29961' title='29961'>Malingering is a subject upon which I have sometimes thought of writing a monograph. </span>
<span sid='29962' title='29962'>A little occasional talk about half-crowns, oysters, or any other extraneous subject produces a pleasing effect of delirium.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29963' title='29963'>'But why would you not let me near you since there was in truth no infection?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29964' title='29964'>'Can you ask, my dear Watson? </span>
<span sid='29965' title='29965'>Do you imagine that I have no respect for your medical talents? </span>
<span sid='29966' title='29966'>Could I fancy that your astute judgment would pass a dying man who, however weak, had no rise of pulse or temperature? </span>
<span sid='29967' title='29967'>At four yards I could deceive you. </span>
<span sid='29968' title='29968'>If I failed to do so who would bring my Smith within my grasp? </span>
<span sid='29969' title='29969'>No, Watson, I would not touch that box. </span>
<span sid='29970' title='29970'>You can just see if you look at it sideways where the sharp spring like a viper's tooth emerges as you open it. </span>
<span sid='29971' title='29971'>I dare say it was by some such device that poor Savage, who stood between this monster and a reversion, was done to death. </span>
<span sid='29972' title='29972'>My correspondence however is, as you know, a varied one, and I am somewhat upon my guard against any packages which reach me. </span>
<span sid='29973' title='29973'>It was clear to me however that by pretending that he had really succeeded in his design I might surprise a confession. </span>
<span sid='29974' title='29974'>That pretence I have carried out with the thoroughness of the true artist. </span>
<span sid='29975' title='29975'>Thank you, Watson, you must help me on with my coat. </span>
<span sid='29976' title='29976'>When we have finished at the police-station I think that something nutritious at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Simpson's&t=h'>Simpson's</a> would not be out of place.'</span>
