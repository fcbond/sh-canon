<h1><span sid='54421' title='54421'>The Adventure of Silver Blaze</span></h1>
<p class="subtitle">Arthur Conan Doyle<label for="sn-meta-silv" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-meta-silv" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><!--googleoff: all--><b>Story Number</b>: 15<br><b>Published in</b>: The Strand Magazine in December 1892<br><b>Collected in</b>: The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes<!--googleon: all--></span></p>
<p>
<span sid='54422' title='54422'>'I am afraid, Watson, that I shall have to go,' said Holmes, as we sat down together to our breakfast one morning.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54423' title='54423'>'Go! </span>
<span sid='54424' title='54424'>Where to?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54425' title='54425'>'To <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Dartmoor&t=h'>Dartmoor</a> - to King's Pyland.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54426' title='54426'>I was not surprised. </span>
<span sid='54427' title='54427'>Indeed, my only wonder was that he had not already been mixed up in this extraordinary case, which was the one topic of conversation through the length and breadth of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>. </span>
<span sid='54428' title='54428'>For a whole day my companion had rambled about the room with his chin upon his chest and his brows knitted, charging and re-charging his pipe with the strongest black tobacco, and absolutely deaf to any of my questions or remarks. </span>
<span sid='54429' title='54429'>Fresh editions of every paper had been sent up by our newsagent only to be glanced over and tossed down into a corner. </span>
<span sid='54430' title='54430'>Yet, silent as he was, I knew perfectly well what it was over which he was brooding. </span>
<span sid='54431' title='54431'>There was but one problem before the public which could challenge his powers of analysis, and that was the singular disappearance of the favourite for the Wessex Cup, and the tragic murder of its trainer. </span>
<span sid='54432' title='54432'>When, therefore, he suddenly announced his intention of setting out for the scene of the drama, it was only what I had both expected and hoped for.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54433' title='54433'>'I should be most happy to go down with you if I should not be in the way,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54434' title='54434'>'My dear Watson, you would confer a great favour upon me by coming. </span>
<span sid='54435' title='54435'>And I think that your time will not be misspent, for there are points about this case which promise to make it an absolutely unique one.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54436' title='54436'>We have, I think, just time to catch our train at Paddington, and I will go further into the matter upon our journey. </span>
<span sid='54437' title='54437'>You would oblige me by bringing with you your very excellent field-glass.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54438' title='54438'>And so it happened that an hour or so later I found myself in the corner of a first-class carriage, flying along, en route for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Exeter&t=h'>Exeter</a>, while Sherlock Holmes, with his sharp, eager face framed in his ear-flapped travelling-cap, dipped rapidly into the bundle of fresh papers which he had procured at Paddington. </span>
<span sid='54439' title='54439'>We had left <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Reading&t=h'>Reading</a> far behind us before he thrust the last of them under the seat, and offered me his cigar-case.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54440' title='54440'>'We are going well,' said he, looking out of the window, and glancing at his watch. </span>
<span sid='54441' title='54441'>'Our rate at present is fifty-three and a half miles an hour.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54442' title='54442'>'I have not observed the quarter-mile posts,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54443' title='54443'>'Nor have I. </span>
<span sid='54444' title='54444'>But the telegraph posts upon this line are sixty yards apart, and the calculation is a simple one. </span>
<span sid='54445' title='54445'>I presume that you have already looked into this matter of the murder of John Straker and the disappearance of Silver Blaze?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54446' title='54446'>'I have seen what the Telegraph and the Chronicle have to say.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54447' title='54447'>'It is one of those cases where the art of the reasoner should be used rather for the sifting of details than for the acquiring of fresh evidence. </span>
<span sid='54448' title='54448'>The tragedy has been so uncommon, so complete, and of such personal importance to so many people that we are suffering from a plethora of surmise, conjecture, and hypothesis. </span>
<span sid='54449' title='54449'>The difficulty is to detach the framework of fact - of absolute, undeniable fact - from the embellishments of theorists and reporters. </span>
<span sid='54450' title='54450'>Then, having established ourselves upon this sound basis, it is our duty to see what inferences may be drawn, and which are the special points upon which the whole mystery turns. </span>
<span sid='54451' title='54451'>On Tuesday evening I received telegrams, both from Colonel <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a>, the owner of the horse, and from Inspector Gregory, who is looking after the case, inviting my co-operation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54452' title='54452'>'Tuesday evening!' I exclaimed. </span>
<span sid='54453' title='54453'>'And this is Thursday morning. </span>
<span sid='54454' title='54454'>Why did you not go down yesterday?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54455' title='54455'>'Because I made a blunder, my dear Watson - which is, I am afraid, a more common occurrence than anyone would think who only knew me through your memoirs. </span>
<span sid='54456' title='54456'>The fact is that I could not believe it possible that the most remarkable horse in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> could long remain concealed, especially in so sparsely inhabited a place as the north of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Dartmoor&t=h'>Dartmoor</a>. </span>
<span sid='54457' title='54457'>From hour to hour yesterday I expected to hear that he had been found, and that his abductor was the murderer of John Straker. </span>
<span sid='54458' title='54458'>When, however, another morning had come and I found that, beyond the arrest of young Fitzroy Simpson, nothing had been done, I felt that it was time for me to take action. </span>
<span sid='54459' title='54459'>Yet in some ways I feel that yesterday has not been wasted.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54460' title='54460'>'You have formed a theory then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54461' title='54461'>'At least I have a grip of the essential facts of the case. </span>
<span sid='54462' title='54462'>I shall enumerate them to you, for nothing clears up a case so much as stating it to another person, and I can hardly expect your co-operation if I do not show you the position from which we start.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54463' title='54463'>I lay back against the cushions, puffing at my cigar, while Holmes, leaning forward, with his long thin forefinger checking off the points upon the palm of his left hand, gave me a sketch of the events which had led to our journey.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54464' title='54464'>'Silver Blaze,' said he, 'is from the Isonomy stock, and holds as brilliant a record as his famous ancestor. </span>
<span sid='54465' title='54465'>He is now in his fifth year, and has brought in turn each of the prizes of the turf to Colonel <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a>, his fortunate owner. </span>
<span sid='54466' title='54466'>Up to the time of the catastrophe he was first favourite for the Wessex Cup, the betting being three to one on. </span>
<span sid='54467' title='54467'>He has always, however, been a prime favourite with the racing public, and has never yet disappointed them, so that even at short odds enormous sums of money have been laid upon him. </span>
<span sid='54468' title='54468'>It is obvious, therefore, that there were many people who had the strongest interest in preventing Silver Blaze from being there at the fall of the flag next Tuesday.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54469' title='54469'>'This fact was, of course, appreciated at King's Pyland, where the Colonel's training stable is situated. </span>
<span sid='54470' title='54470'>Every precaution was taken to guard the favourite. </span>
<span sid='54471' title='54471'>The trainer, John Straker, is a retired jockey, who rode in Colonel <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a>'s colours before he became too heavy for the weighing-chair. </span>
<span sid='54472' title='54472'>He has served the Colonel for five years as jockey, and for seven as trainer, and has always shown himself to be a zealous and honest servant. </span>
<span sid='54473' title='54473'>Under him were three lads, for the establishment was a small one, containing only four horses in all. </span>
<span sid='54474' title='54474'>One of these lads sat up each night in the stable, while the others slept in the loft. </span>
<span sid='54475' title='54475'>All three bore excellent characters. </span>
<span sid='54476' title='54476'>John Straker, who is a married man, lived in a small villa about two hundred yards from the stables. </span>
<span sid='54477' title='54477'>He has no children, keeps one maid-servant, and is comfortably off. </span>
<span sid='54478' title='54478'>The country round is very lonely, but about half a mile to the north there is a small cluster of villas which have been built by a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Tavistock&t=h'>Tavistock</a> contractor for the use of invalids and others who may wish to enjoy the pure <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Dartmoor&t=h'>Dartmoor</a> air. </span>
<span sid='54479' title='54479'><a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Tavistock&t=h'>Tavistock</a> itself lies two miles to the west, while across the moor, also about two miles distant, is the larger training establishment of Capleton, which belongs to Lord Backwater, and is managed by Silas Brown. </span>
<span sid='54480' title='54480'>In every other direction the moor is a complete wilderness, inhabited only by a few roaming gipsies. </span>
<span sid='54481' title='54481'>Such was the general situation last Monday night, when the catastrophe occurred.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54482' title='54482'>'On that evening the horses had been exercised and watered as usual, and the stables were locked up at nine o'clock. </span>
<span sid='54483' title='54483'>Two of the lads walked up to the trainer's house, where they had supper in the kitchen, while the third, Ned Hunter, remained on guard. </span>
<span sid='54484' title='54484'>At a few minutes after nine the maid, Edith Baxter, carried down to the stables his supper, which consisted of a dish of curried mutton. </span>
<span sid='54485' title='54485'>She took no liquid, as there was a water-tap in the stables, and it was the rule that the lad on duty should drink nothing else. </span>
<span sid='54486' title='54486'>The maid carried a lantern with her, as it was very dark, and the path ran across the open moor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54487' title='54487'>'Edith Baxter was within thirty yards of the stables when a man appeared out of the darkness and called to her to stop. </span>
<span sid='54488' title='54488'>As he stepped into the circle of yellow light thrown by the lantern she saw that he was a person of gentlemanly bearing, dressed in a grey suit of tweed with a cloth cap. </span>
<span sid='54489' title='54489'>He wore gaiters, and carried a heavy stick with a knob to it. </span>
<span sid='54490' title='54490'>She was most impressed, however, by the extreme pallor of his face and by the nervousness of his manner. </span>
<span sid='54491' title='54491'>His age, she thought, would be rather over thirty than under it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54492' title='54492'>'"Can you tell me where I am?" he asked. </span>
<span sid='54493' title='54493'>"I had almost made up my mind to sleep on the moor when I saw the light of your lantern."</span>
<p>
<span sid='54494' title='54494'>'"You are close to the King's Pyland training stables," she said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54495' title='54495'>'"Oh, indeed! </span>
<span sid='54496' title='54496'>What a stroke of luck!" he cried. </span>
<span sid='54497' title='54497'>"I understand that a stable boy sleeps there alone every night. </span>
<span sid='54498' title='54498'>Perhaps that is his supper which you are carrying to him. </span>
<span sid='54499' title='54499'>Now I am sure that you would not be too proud to earn the price of a new dress, would you?" </span>
<span sid='54500' title='54500'>He took a piece of white paper folded up out of his waistcoat pocket. </span>
<span sid='54501' title='54501'>"See that the boy has this to-night, and you shall have the prettiest frock that money can buy."</span>
<p>
<span sid='54502' title='54502'>'She was frightened by the earnestness of his manner, and ran past him to the window through which she was accustomed to hand the meals. </span>
<span sid='54503' title='54503'>It was already open, and Hunter was seated at the small table inside. </span>
<span sid='54504' title='54504'>She had begun to tell him of what had happened, when the stranger came up again.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54505' title='54505'>'"Good evening," said he, looking through the window, "I wanted to have a word with you." </span>
<span sid='54506' title='54506'>The girl has sworn that as he spoke she noticed the corner of the little paper packet protruding from his closed hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54507' title='54507'>'"What business have you here?" asked the lad.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54508' title='54508'>'"It's business that may put something into your pocket," said the other. </span>
<span sid='54509' title='54509'>"You've two horses in for the Wessex Cup - Silver Blaze and Bayard. </span>
<span sid='54510' title='54510'>Let me have the straight tip, and you won't be a loser. </span>
<span sid='54511' title='54511'>Is it a fact that at the weights Bayard could give the other a hundred yards in five furlongs, and that the stable have put their money on him?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='54512' title='54512'>'"So you're one of those damned touts," cried the lad. </span>
<span sid='54513' title='54513'>"I'll show you how we serve them in King's Pyland." </span>
<span sid='54514' title='54514'>He sprang up and rushed across the stable to unloose the dog. </span>
<span sid='54515' title='54515'>The girl fled away to the house, but as she ran she looked back, and saw that the stranger was leaning through the window. </span>
<span sid='54516' title='54516'>A minute later, however, when Hunter rushed out with the hound he was gone, and though the lad ran all round the buildings he failed to find any trace of him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54517' title='54517'>'One moment!' I asked. </span>
<span sid='54518' title='54518'>'Did the stable boy, when he ran out with the dog, leave the door unlocked behind him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54519' title='54519'>'Excellent, Watson; excellent!' murmured my companion. </span>
<span sid='54520' title='54520'>'The importance of the point struck me so forcibly, that I sent a special wire to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Dartmoor&t=h'>Dartmoor</a> yesterday to clear the matter up. </span>
<span sid='54521' title='54521'>The boy locked the door before he left it. </span>
<span sid='54522' title='54522'>The window, I may add, was not large enough for a man to get through.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54523' title='54523'>'Hunter waited until his fellow-grooms had returned, when he sent a message up to the trainer and told him what had occurred. </span>
<span sid='54524' title='54524'>Straker was excited at hearing the account, although he does not seem to have quite realized its true significance. </span>
<span sid='54525' title='54525'>It left him, however, vaguely uneasy, and Mrs. </span>
<span sid='54526' title='54526'>Straker, waking at one in the morning, found that he was dressing. </span>
<span sid='54527' title='54527'>In reply to her inquiries, he said that he could not sleep on account of his anxiety about the horses, and that he intended to walk down to the stables to see that all was well. </span>
<span sid='54528' title='54528'>She begged him to remain at home, as she could hear the rain pattering against the windows, but in spite of her entreaties he pulled on his large mackintosh and left the house.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54529' title='54529'>'Mrs. Straker awoke at seven in the morning, to find that her husband had not yet returned. </span>
<span sid='54530' title='54530'>She dressed herself hastily, called the maid, and set off for the stables. </span>
<span sid='54531' title='54531'>The door was open; inside, huddled together upon a chair, Hunter was sunk in a state of absolute stupor, the favourite's stall was empty, and there were no signs of his trainer.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54532' title='54532'>'The two lads who slept in the chaff-cutting loft above the harness-room were quickly roused. </span>
<span sid='54533' title='54533'>They had heard nothing during the night, for they are both sound sleepers. </span>
<span sid='54534' title='54534'>Hunter was obviously under the influence of some powerful drug; and, as no sense could be got out of him, he was left to sleep it off while the two lads and the two women ran out in search of the absentees. </span>
<span sid='54535' title='54535'>They still had hopes that the trainer had for some reason taken out the horse for early exercise, but on ascending the knoll near the house, from which all the neighbouring moors were visible, they not only could see no signs of the favourite, but they perceived something which warned them that they were in the presence of a tragedy.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54536' title='54536'>'About a quarter of a mile from the stables, John Straker's overcoat was flapping from a furze bush. </span>
<span sid='54537' title='54537'>Immediately beyond there was a bowl-shaped depression in the moor, and at the bottom of this was found the dead body of the unfortunate trainer. </span>
<span sid='54538' title='54538'>His head had been shattered by a savage blow from some heavy weapon, and he was wounded in the thigh, where there was a long, clean cut, inflicted evidently by some very sharp instrument. </span>
<span sid='54539' title='54539'>It was clear, however, that Straker had defended himself vigorously against his assailants, for in his right hand he held a small knife, which was clotted with blood up to the handle, while in his left he grasped a red and black silk cravat, which was recognized by the maid as having been worn on the preceding evening by the stranger who had visited the stables.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54540' title='54540'>'Hunter, on recovering from his stupor, was also quite positive as to the ownership of the cravat. </span>
<span sid='54541' title='54541'>He was equally certain that the same stranger had, while standing at the window, drugged his curried mutton, and so deprived the stables of their watchman.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54542' title='54542'>'As to the missing horse, there were abundant proofs in the mud which lay at the bottom of the fatal hollow, that he had been there at the time of the struggle. </span>
<span sid='54543' title='54543'>But from that morning he has disappeared; and although a large reward has been offered, and all the gipsies of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Dartmoor&t=h'>Dartmoor</a> are on the alert, no news has come of him. </span>
<span sid='54544' title='54544'>Finally an analysis has shown that the remains of his supper, left by the stable lad, contain an appreciable quantity of powdered opium, while the people of the house partook of the same dish on the same night without any ill effect.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54545' title='54545'>'Those are the main facts of the case stripped of all surmise and stated as baldly as possible. </span>
<span sid='54546' title='54546'>I shall now recapitulate what the police have done in the matter.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54547' title='54547'>'Inspector Gregory, to whom the case has been committed, is an extremely competent officer. </span>
<span sid='54548' title='54548'>Were he but gifted with imagination he might rise to great heights in his profession. </span>
<span sid='54549' title='54549'>On his arrival he promptly found and arrested the man upon whom suspicion naturally rested. </span>
<span sid='54550' title='54550'>There was little difficulty in finding him, for he was thoroughly well known in the neighbourhood. </span>
<span sid='54551' title='54551'>His name, it appears, was Fitzroy Simpson. </span>
<span sid='54552' title='54552'>He was a man of excellent birth and education, who had squandered a fortune upon the turf, and who lived now by doing a little quiet and genteel bookmaking in the sporting clubs of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='54553' title='54553'>An examination of his betting-book shows that bets to the amount of five thousand pounds had been registered by him against the favourite.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54554' title='54554'>'On being arrested he volunteered the statement that he had come down to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Dartmoor&t=h'>Dartmoor</a> in the hope of getting some information about the King's Pyland horses, and also about Desborough, the second favourite, which was in charge of Silas Brown, at the Capleton stables. </span>
<span sid='54555' title='54555'>He did not attempt to deny that he had acted as described upon the evening before, but declared that he had no sinister designs, and had simply wished to obtain first-hand information. </span>
<span sid='54556' title='54556'>When confronted with the cravat he turned very pale, and was utterly unable to account for its presence in the hand of the murdered man. </span>
<span sid='54557' title='54557'>His wet clothing showed that he had been out in the storm of the night before, and his stick, which was a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Penang&t=h'>Penang</a> lawyer, weighted with lead, was just such a weapon as might, by repeated blows, have inflicted the terrible injuries to which the trainer had succumbed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54558' title='54558'>'On the other hand, there was no wound upon his person, while the state of Straker's knife would show that one, at least, of his assailants must bear his mark upon him. </span>
<span sid='54559' title='54559'>There you have it all in a nutshell, Watson, and if you can give me any light I shall be infinitely obliged to you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54560' title='54560'>I had listened with the greatest interest to the statement which Holmes, with characteristic clearness, had laid before me. </span>
<span sid='54561' title='54561'>Though most of the facts were familiar to me, I had not sufficiently appreciated their relative importance, nor their connection with each other.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54562' title='54562'>'Is it not possible,' I suggested, 'that the incised wound upon Straker may have been caused by his own knife in the convulsive struggles which follow any brain injury?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54563' title='54563'>'It is more than possible; it is probable,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='54564' title='54564'>'In that case, one of the main points in favour of the accused disappears.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54565' title='54565'>'And yet,' said I, 'even now I fail to understand what the theory of the police can be.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54566' title='54566'>'I am afraid that whatever theory we state has very grave objections to it,' returned my companion. </span>
<span sid='54567' title='54567'>'The police imagine, I take it, that this Fitzroy Simpson, having drugged the lad, and having in some way obtained a duplicate key, opened the stable door, and took out the horse, with the intention, apparently, of kidnapping him altogether. </span>
<span sid='54568' title='54568'>His bridle is missing, so that Simpson must have put it on. </span>
<span sid='54569' title='54569'>Then, having left the door open behind him, he was leading the horse away over the moor, when he was either met or overtaken by the trainer. </span>
<span sid='54570' title='54570'>A row naturally ensued, Simpson beat out the trainer's brains with his heavy stick without receiving any injury from the small knife which Straker used in self-defence, and then the thief either led the horse on to some secret hiding-place, or else it may have bolted during the struggle, and be now wandering out on the moors. </span>
<span sid='54571' title='54571'>That is the case as it appears to the police, and improbable as it is, all other explanations are more improbable still. </span>
<span sid='54572' title='54572'>However, I shall very quickly test the matter when I am once upon the spot, and until then I really cannot see how we can get much further than our present position.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54573' title='54573'>It was evening before we reached the little town of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Tavistock&t=h'>Tavistock</a>, which lies, like the boss of a shield, in the middle of the huge circle of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Dartmoor&t=h'>Dartmoor</a>. </span>
<span sid='54574' title='54574'>Two gentlemen were awaiting us at the station; the one a tall fair man with lion-like hair and beard, and curiously penetrating light blue eyes, the other a small alert person, very neat and dapper, in a frock-coat and gaiters, with trim little side-whiskers and an eyeglass. </span>
<span sid='54575' title='54575'>The latter was Colonel <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a>, the well-known sportsman, the other Inspector Gregory, a man who was rapidly making his name in the English detective service.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54576' title='54576'>'I am delighted that you have come down, Mr. Holmes,' said the Colonel. </span>
<span sid='54577' title='54577'>'The Inspector here has done all that could possibly be suggested; but I wish to leave no stone unturned in trying to avenge poor Straker, and in recovering my horse.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54578' title='54578'>'Have there been any fresh developments?' asked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54579' title='54579'>'I am sorry to say that we have made very little progress,' said the Inspector. </span>
<span sid='54580' title='54580'>'We have an open carriage outside, and as you would no doubt like to see the place before the light fails, we might talk it over as we drive.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54581' title='54581'>A minute later we were all seated in a comfortable landau and were rattling through the quaint old <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Devonshire&t=h'>Devonshire</a> town. </span>
<span sid='54582' title='54582'>Inspector Gregory was full of his case, and poured out a stream of remarks, while Holmes threw in an occasional question or interjection. </span>
<span sid='54583' title='54583'>Colonel <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a> leaned back with his arms folded and his hat tilted over his eyes, while I listened with interest to the dialogue of the two detectives. </span>
<span sid='54584' title='54584'>Gregory was formulating his theory, which was almost exactly what Holmes had foretold in the train.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54585' title='54585'>'The net is drawn pretty close round Fitzroy Simpson,' he remarked, 'and I believe myself that he is our man. </span>
<span sid='54586' title='54586'>At the same time, I recognize that the evidence is purely circumstantial, and that some new development may upset it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54587' title='54587'>'How about Straker's knife?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54588' title='54588'>'We have quite come to the conclusion that he wounded himself in his fall.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54589' title='54589'>'My friend Dr. Watson made that suggestion to me as we came down. </span>
<span sid='54590' title='54590'>If so, it would tell against this man Simpson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54591' title='54591'>'Undoubtedly. </span>
<span sid='54592' title='54592'>He has neither a knife nor any sign of a wound. </span>
<span sid='54593' title='54593'>The evidence against him is certainly very strong. </span>
<span sid='54594' title='54594'>He had a great interest in the disappearance of the favourite, he lies under the suspicion of having poisoned the stable boy, he was undoubtedly out in the storm, he was armed with a heavy stick, and his cravat was found in the dead man's hand. </span>
<span sid='54595' title='54595'>I really think we have enough to go before a jury.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54596' title='54596'>Holmes shook his head. </span>
<span sid='54597' title='54597'>'A clever counsel would tear it all to rags,' said he. </span>
<span sid='54598' title='54598'>'Why should he take the horse out of the stable? </span>
<span sid='54599' title='54599'>If he wished to injure it, why could he not do it there? </span>
<span sid='54600' title='54600'>Has a duplicate key been found in his possession? </span>
<span sid='54601' title='54601'>What chemist sold him the powdered opium? </span>
<span sid='54602' title='54602'>Above all, where could he, a stranger to the district, hide a horse, and such a horse as this? </span>
<span sid='54603' title='54603'>What is his own explanation as to the paper which he wished the maid to give to the stable boy?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54604' title='54604'>'He says that it was a ten-pound note. </span>
<span sid='54605' title='54605'>One was found in his purse. </span>
<span sid='54606' title='54606'>But your other difficulties are not so formidable as they seem. </span>
<span sid='54607' title='54607'>He is not a stranger to the district. </span>
<span sid='54608' title='54608'>He has twice lodged at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Tavistock&t=h'>Tavistock</a> in the summer. </span>
<span sid='54609' title='54609'>The opium was probably brought from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='54610' title='54610'>The key, having served its purpose, would be hurled away. </span>
<span sid='54611' title='54611'>The horse may lie at the bottom of one of the pits or old mines upon the moor.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54612' title='54612'>'What does he say about the cravat?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54613' title='54613'>'He acknowledges that it is his, and declares that he had lost it. </span>
<span sid='54614' title='54614'>But a new element has been introduced into the case which may account for his leading the horse from the stable.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54615' title='54615'>Holmes pricked up his ears.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54616' title='54616'>'We have found traces which show that a party of gipsies encamped on Monday night within a mile of the spot where the murder took place. </span>
<span sid='54617' title='54617'>On Tuesday they were gone. </span>
<span sid='54618' title='54618'>Now, presuming that there was some understanding between Simpson and these gipsies, might he not have been leading the horse to them when he was overtaken, and may they not have him now?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54619' title='54619'>'It is certainly possible.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54620' title='54620'>'The moor is being scoured for these gipsies. </span>
<span sid='54621' title='54621'>I have also examined every stable and outhouse in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Tavistock&t=h'>Tavistock</a>, and for a radius of ten miles.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54622' title='54622'>'There is another training stable quite close, I understand?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54623' title='54623'>'Yes, and that is a factor which we must certainly not neglect. </span>
<span sid='54624' title='54624'>As Desborough, their horse, was second in the betting, they had an interest in the disappearance of the favourite. </span>
<span sid='54625' title='54625'>Silas Brown, the trainer, is known to have had large bets upon the event, and he was no friend to poor Straker. </span>
<span sid='54626' title='54626'>We have, however, examined the stables, and there is nothing to connect him with the affair.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54627' title='54627'>'And nothing to connect this man Simpson with the interests of the Capleton stable?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54628' title='54628'>'Nothing at all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54629' title='54629'>Holmes leaned back in the carriage and the conversation ceased. </span>
<span sid='54630' title='54630'>A few minutes later our driver pulled up at a neat little red-brick villa with overhanging eaves, which stood by the road. </span>
<span sid='54631' title='54631'>Some distance off, across a paddock, lay a long grey-tiled outbuilding. </span>
<span sid='54632' title='54632'>In every other direction the low curves of the moor, bronze-coloured from the fading ferns, stretched away to the skyline, broken only by the steeples of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Tavistock&t=h'>Tavistock</a>, and by a cluster of houses away to the westward, which marked the Capleton stables. </span>
<span sid='54633' title='54633'>We all sprang out with the exception of Holmes, who continued to lean back with his eyes fixed upon the sky in front of him, entirely absorbed in his own thoughts. </span>
<span sid='54634' title='54634'>It was only when I touched his arm that he roused himself with a violent start and stepped out of the carriage.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54635' title='54635'>'Excuse me,' said he, turning to Colonel <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a>, who had looked at him in some surprise. </span>
<span sid='54636' title='54636'>'I was daydreaming.' </span>
<span sid='54637' title='54637'>There was a gleam in his eyes and a suppressed excitement in his manner which convinced me, used as I was to his ways, that his hand was upon a clue, though I could not imagine where he had found it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54638' title='54638'>'Perhaps you would prefer at once to go on to the scene of the crime, Mr. Holmes?' said Gregory.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54639' title='54639'>'I think that I should prefer to stay here a little and go into one or two questions of detail. </span>
<span sid='54640' title='54640'>Straker was brought back here, I presume?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54641' title='54641'>'Yes, he lies upstairs. </span>
<span sid='54642' title='54642'>The inquest is to-morrow.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54643' title='54643'>'He has been in your service some years, Colonel <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a>?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54644' title='54644'>'I have always found him an excellent servant.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54645' title='54645'>'I presume that you made an inventory of what he had in his pockets at the time of his death, Inspector?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54646' title='54646'>'I have the things themselves in the sitting-room, if you would care to see them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54647' title='54647'>'I should be very glad.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54648' title='54648'>We all filed into the front room, and sat round the central table, while the Inspector unlocked a square tin box and laid a small heap of things before us. </span>
<span sid='54649' title='54649'>There was a box of vestas, two inches of tallow candle, an A.D.P. briar-root pipe, a pouch of sealskin with half an ounce of long-cut cavendish, a silver watch with a gold chain, five sovereigns in gold, an aluminium pencil-case, a few papers, and an ivory-handled knife with a very delicate inflexible blade marked Weiss & Co., <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54650' title='54650'>'This is a very singular knife,' said Holmes, lifting it up and examining it minutely. </span>
<span sid='54651' title='54651'>'I presume, as I see blood-stains upon it, that it is the one which was found in the dead man's grasp. </span>
<span sid='54652' title='54652'>Watson, this knife is surely in your line.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54653' title='54653'>'It is what we call a cataract knife,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54654' title='54654'>'I thought so. </span>
<span sid='54655' title='54655'>A very delicate blade devised for very delicate work. </span>
<span sid='54656' title='54656'>A strange thing for a man to carry with him upon a rough expedition, especially as it would not shut in his pocket.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54657' title='54657'>'The tip was guarded by a disc of cork which we found beside his body,' said the Inspector. </span>
<span sid='54658' title='54658'>'His wife tells us that the knife had lain for some days upon the dressing-table, and that he had picked it up as he left the room. </span>
<span sid='54659' title='54659'>It was a poor weapon, but perhaps the best that he could lay his hand on at the moment.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54660' title='54660'>'Very possible. </span>
<span sid='54661' title='54661'>How about these papers?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54662' title='54662'>'Three of them are receipted hay-dealers' accounts. </span>
<span sid='54663' title='54663'>One of them is a letter of instructions from Colonel <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a>. </span>
<span sid='54664' title='54664'>This other is a milliner's account for thirty-seven pounds fifteen, made out by Madame Lesurier, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bond Street&t=h'>Bond Street</a>, to William Darbyshire. </span>
<span sid='54665' title='54665'>Mrs. Straker tells us that Darbyshire was a friend of her husband's, and that occasionally his letters were addressed here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54666' title='54666'>'Madame Darbyshire had somewhat expensive tastes,' remarked Holmes, glancing down the account. </span>
<span sid='54667' title='54667'>'Twenty-two guineas is rather heavy for a single costume. </span>
<span sid='54668' title='54668'>However, there appears to be nothing more to learn, and we may now go down to the scene of the crime.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54669' title='54669'>As we emerged from the sitting-room a woman who had been waiting in the passage took a step forward and laid her hand upon the Inspector's sleeve. </span>
<span sid='54670' title='54670'>Her face was haggard, and thin, and eager; stamped with the print of a recent horror.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54671' title='54671'>'Have you got them? </span>
<span sid='54672' title='54672'>Have you found them?' she panted.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54673' title='54673'>'No, Mrs. Straker; but Mr. Holmes, here, has come from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> to help us, and we shall do all that is possible.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54674' title='54674'>'Surely I met you in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Plymouth&t=h'>Plymouth</a>, at a garden-party, some little time ago, Mrs. Straker,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54675' title='54675'>'No, sir; you are mistaken.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54676' title='54676'>'Dear me; why, I could have sworn to it. </span>
<span sid='54677' title='54677'>You wore a costume of dove-coloured silk with ostrich feather trimming.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54678' title='54678'>'I never had such a dress, sir,' answered the lady.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54679' title='54679'>'Ah; that quite settles it,' said Holmes; and, with an apology, he followed the Inspector outside. </span>
<span sid='54680' title='54680'>A short walk across the moor took us to the hollow in which the body had been found. </span>
<span sid='54681' title='54681'>At the brink of it was the furze bush upon which the coat had been hung.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54682' title='54682'>'There was no wind that night, I understand,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54683' title='54683'>'None; but very heavy rain.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54684' title='54684'>'In that case the overcoat was not blown against the furze bushes, but placed there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54685' title='54685'>'Yes, it was laid across the bush.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54686' title='54686'>'You fill me with interest. </span>
<span sid='54687' title='54687'>I perceive that the ground has been trampled up a good deal. </span>
<span sid='54688' title='54688'>No doubt many feet have been there since Monday night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54689' title='54689'>'A piece of matting has been laid here at the side, and we have all stood upon that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54690' title='54690'>'Excellent.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54691' title='54691'>'In this bag I have one of the boots which Straker wore, one of Fitzroy <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Simpson's&t=h'>Simpson's</a> shoes, and a cast horseshoe of Silver Blaze.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54692' title='54692'>'My dear Inspector, you surpass yourself!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54693' title='54693'>Holmes took the bag, and descending into the hollow he pushed the matting into a more central position. </span>
<span sid='54694' title='54694'>Then stretching himself upon his face and leaning his chin upon his hands he made a careful study of the trampled mud in front of him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54695' title='54695'>'Halloa!' said he, suddenly, 'what's this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54696' title='54696'>It was a wax vesta, half burned, which was so coated with mud that it looked at first like a little chip of wood.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54697' title='54697'>'I cannot think how I came to overlook it,' said the Inspector, with an expression of annoyance.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54698' title='54698'>'It was invisible, buried in the mud. </span>
<span sid='54699' title='54699'>I only saw it because I was looking for it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54700' title='54700'>'What! </span>
<span sid='54701' title='54701'>You expected to find it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54702' title='54702'>'I thought it not unlikely.' </span>
<span sid='54703' title='54703'>He took the boots from the bag and compared the impressions of each of them with marks upon the ground. </span>
<span sid='54704' title='54704'>Then he clambered up to the rim of the hollow and crawled about among the ferns and bushes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54705' title='54705'>'I am afraid that there are no more tracks,' said the Inspector. </span>
<span sid='54706' title='54706'>'I have examined the ground very carefully for a hundred yards in each direction.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54707' title='54707'>'Indeed!' said Holmes, rising, 'I should not have the impertinence to do it again after what you say. </span>
<span sid='54708' title='54708'>But I should like to take a little walk over the moors before it grows dark, that I may know my ground tomorrow, and I think that I shall put this horseshoe into my pocket for luck.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54709' title='54709'>Colonel <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a>, who had shown some signs of impatience at my companion's quiet and systematic method of work, glanced at his watch.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54710' title='54710'>'I wish you would come back with me, Inspector,' said he. </span>
<span sid='54711' title='54711'>'There are several points on which I should like your advice, and especially as to whether we do not owe it to the public to remove our horse's name from the entries for the Cup.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54712' title='54712'>'Certainly not,' cried Holmes, with decision; 'I should let the name stand.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54713' title='54713'>The Colonel bowed. </span>
<span sid='54714' title='54714'>'I am very glad to have had your opinion, sir,' said he. </span>
<span sid='54715' title='54715'>'You will find us at poor Straker's house when you have finished your walk, and we can drive together into <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Tavistock&t=h'>Tavistock</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54716' title='54716'>He turned back with the Inspector, while Holmes and I walked slowly across the moor. </span>
<span sid='54717' title='54717'>The sun was beginning to sink behind the stables of Capleton, and the long sloping plain in front of us was tinged with gold, deepening into rich, ruddy brown where the faded ferns and brambles caught the evening light. </span>
<span sid='54718' title='54718'>But the glories of the landscape were all wasted upon my companion, who was sunk in the deepest thought.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54719' title='54719'>'It's this way, Watson,' he said, at last. </span>
<span sid='54720' title='54720'>'We may leave the question of who killed John Straker for the instant, and confine ourselves to finding out what has become of the horse. </span>
<span sid='54721' title='54721'>Now, supposing that he broke away during or after the tragedy, where could he have gone to? </span>
<span sid='54722' title='54722'>The horse is a very gregarious creature. </span>
<span sid='54723' title='54723'>If left to himself, his instincts would have been either to return to King's Pyland or go over to Capleton. </span>
<span sid='54724' title='54724'>Why should he run wild upon the moor? </span>
<span sid='54725' title='54725'>He would surely have been seen by now. </span>
<span sid='54726' title='54726'>And why should gipsies kidnap him? </span>
<span sid='54727' title='54727'>These people always clear out when they hear of trouble, for they do not wish to be pestered by the police. </span>
<span sid='54728' title='54728'>They could not hope to sell such a horse. </span>
<span sid='54729' title='54729'>They would run a great risk and gain nothing by taking him. </span>
<span sid='54730' title='54730'>Surely that is clear.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54731' title='54731'>'Where is he, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54732' title='54732'>'I have already said that he must have gone to King's Pyland or to Capleton. </span>
<span sid='54733' title='54733'>He is not at King's Pyland, therefore he is at Capleton. </span>
<span sid='54734' title='54734'>Let us take that as a working hypothesis, and see what it leads us to. </span>
<span sid='54735' title='54735'>This part of the moor, as the Inspector remarked, is very hard and dry. </span>
<span sid='54736' title='54736'>But it falls away towards Capleton, and you can see from here that there is a long hollow over yonder, which must have been very wet on Monday night. </span>
<span sid='54737' title='54737'>If our supposition is correct, then the horse must have crossed that, and there is the point where we should look for his tracks.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54738' title='54738'>We had been walking briskly during this conversation, and a few more minutes brought us to the hollow in question. </span>
<span sid='54739' title='54739'>At Holmes' request I walked down the bank to the right, and he to the left, but I had not taken fifty paces before I heard him give a shout, and saw him waving his hand to me. </span>
<span sid='54740' title='54740'>The track of a horse was plainly outlined in the soft earth in front of him, and the shoe which he took from his pocket exactly fitted the impression.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54741' title='54741'>'See the value of imagination,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='54742' title='54742'>'It is the one quality which Gregory lacks. </span>
<span sid='54743' title='54743'>We imagined what might have happened, acted upon the supposition, and find ourselves justified. </span>
<span sid='54744' title='54744'>Let us proceed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54745' title='54745'>We crossed the marshy bottom and passed over a quarter of a mile of dry, hard turf. </span>
<span sid='54746' title='54746'>Again the ground sloped and again we came on the tracks. </span>
<span sid='54747' title='54747'>Then we lost them for half a mile, but only to pick them up once more quite close to Capleton. </span>
<span sid='54748' title='54748'>It was Holmes who saw them first, and he stood pointing with a look of triumph upon his face. </span>
<span sid='54749' title='54749'>A man's track was visible beside the horse's.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54750' title='54750'>'The horse was alone before,' I cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54751' title='54751'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='54752' title='54752'>It was alone before. </span>
<span sid='54753' title='54753'>Halloa! what is this?' </span>
<span sid='54754' title='54754'>The double track turned sharp off and took the direction of King's Pyland. </span>
<span sid='54755' title='54755'>Holmes whistled, and we both followed along after it. </span>
<span sid='54756' title='54756'>His eyes were on the trail, but I happened to look a little to one side, and saw to my surprise the same tracks coming back again in the opposite direction.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54757' title='54757'>'One for you, Watson,' said Holmes, when I pointed it out; 'you have saved us a long walk which would have brought us back on our own traces. </span>
<span sid='54758' title='54758'>Let us follow the return track.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54759' title='54759'>We had not to go far. </span>
<span sid='54760' title='54760'>It ended at the paving of asphalt which led up to the gates of the Capleton stables. </span>
<span sid='54761' title='54761'>As we approached a groom ran out from them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54762' title='54762'>'We don't want any loiterers about here,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54763' title='54763'>'I only wished to ask a question,' said Holmes, with his finger and thumb in his waistcoat pocket. </span>
<span sid='54764' title='54764'>'Should I be too early to see your master, Mr. </span>
<span sid='54765' title='54765'>Silas Brown, if I were to call at five o'clock to-morrow morning?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54766' title='54766'>'Bless you, sir, if anyone is about he will be, for he is always the first stirring. </span>
<span sid='54767' title='54767'>But here he is, sir, to answer your questions for himself. </span>
<span sid='54768' title='54768'>No, sir, no; it's as much as my place is worth to let him see me touch your money. </span>
<span sid='54769' title='54769'>Afterwards, if you like.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54770' title='54770'>As Sherlock Holmes replaced the half-crown which he had drawn from his pocket, a fierce-looking elderly man strode out from the gate with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54771' title='54771'>'What's this, Dawson?' he cried. </span>
<span sid='54772' title='54772'>'No gossiping! </span>
<span sid='54773' title='54773'>Go about your business! </span>
<span sid='54774' title='54774'>And you - what the devil do you want here?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54775' title='54775'>'Ten minutes' talk with you, my good sir,' said Holmes, in the sweetest of voices.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54776' title='54776'>'I've no time to talk to every gadabout. </span>
<span sid='54777' title='54777'>We want no strangers here. </span>
<span sid='54778' title='54778'>Be off, or you may find a dog at your heels.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54779' title='54779'>Holmes leaned forward and whispered something in the trainer's ear. </span>
<span sid='54780' title='54780'>He started violently and flushed to the temples.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54781' title='54781'>'It's a lie!' he shouted. </span>
<span sid='54782' title='54782'>'An infernal lie!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54783' title='54783'>'Very good! </span>
<span sid='54784' title='54784'>Shall we argue about it here in public, or talk it over in your parlour?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54785' title='54785'>'Oh, come in if you wish to.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54786' title='54786'>Holmes smiled. </span>
<span sid='54787' title='54787'>'I shall not keep you more than a few minutes, Watson,' he said. </span>
<span sid='54788' title='54788'>'Now, Mr. Brown, I am quite at your disposal.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54789' title='54789'>It was quite twenty minutes, and the reds had all faded into greys before Holmes and the trainer reappeared. </span>
<span sid='54790' title='54790'>Never have I seen such a change as had been brought about in Silas Brown in that short time. </span>
<span sid='54791' title='54791'>His face was ashy pale, beads of perspiration shone upon his brow, and his hands shook until the hunting-crop wagged like a branch in the wind. </span>
<span sid='54792' title='54792'>His bullying, overbearing manner was all gone too, and he cringed along at my companion's side like a dog with its master.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54793' title='54793'>'Your instructions will be done. </span>
<span sid='54794' title='54794'>It shall be done,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54795' title='54795'>'There must be no mistake,' said Holmes, looking round at him. </span>
<span sid='54796' title='54796'>The other winced as he read the menace in his eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54797' title='54797'>'Oh, no, there shall be no mistake. </span>
<span sid='54798' title='54798'>It shall be there. </span>
<span sid='54799' title='54799'>Should I change it first or not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54800' title='54800'>Holmes though a little and then burst out laughing. </span>
<span sid='54801' title='54801'>'No, don't,' said he. </span>
<span sid='54802' title='54802'>'I shall write to you about it. </span>
<span sid='54803' title='54803'>No tricks now or-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54804' title='54804'>'Oh, you can trust me, you can trust me!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54805' title='54805'>'You must see to it on the day as if it were your own.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54806' title='54806'>'You can rely upon me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54807' title='54807'>'Yes, I think I can. </span>
<span sid='54808' title='54808'>Well, you shall hear from me to-morrow.' </span>
<span sid='54809' title='54809'>He turned upon his heel, disregarding the trembling hand which the other held out to him, and we set off for King's Pyland.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54810' title='54810'>'A more perfect compound of the bully, coward and sneak than Master Silas Brown I have seldom met with,' remarked Holmes, as we trudged along together.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54811' title='54811'>'He has the horse, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54812' title='54812'>'He tried to bluster out of it, but I described to him so exactly what his actions had been upon that morning, that he is convinced that I was watching him. </span>
<span sid='54813' title='54813'>Of course, you observed the peculiarly square toes in the impressions, and that his own boots exactly corresponded to them. </span>
<span sid='54814' title='54814'>Again, of course, no subordinate would have dared to have done such a thing. </span>
<span sid='54815' title='54815'>I described to him how when, according to his custom, he was the first down, he perceived a strange horse wandering over the moor; how he went out to it, and his astonishment at recognizing from the white forehead which has given the favourite its name that chance had put in his power the only horse which could beat the one upon which he had put his money. </span>
<span sid='54816' title='54816'>Then I described how his first impulse had been to lead him back to King's Pyland, and how the devil had shown him how he could hide the horse until the race was over, and how he had led it back and concealed it at Capleton. </span>
<span sid='54817' title='54817'>When I told him every detail he gave it up, and thought only of saving his own skin.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54818' title='54818'>'But his stables had been searched.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54819' title='54819'>'Oh, an old horse-faker like him has many a dodge.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54820' title='54820'>'But are you not afraid to leave the horse in his power now, since he has every interest in injuring it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54821' title='54821'>'My dear fellow, he will guard it as the apple of his eye. </span>
<span sid='54822' title='54822'>He knows that his only hope of mercy is to produce it safe.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54823' title='54823'>'Colonel <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a> did not impress me as a man who would be likely to show much mercy in any case.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54824' title='54824'>'The matter does not rest with Colonel <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a>. </span>
<span sid='54825' title='54825'>I follow my own methods, and tell as much or as little as I choose. </span>
<span sid='54826' title='54826'>That is the advantage of being unofficial. </span>
<span sid='54827' title='54827'>I don't know whether you observed it, Watson, but the Colonel's manner has been just a trifle cavalier to me. </span>
<span sid='54828' title='54828'>I am inclined now to have a little amusement at his expense. </span>
<span sid='54829' title='54829'>Say nothing to him about the horse.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54830' title='54830'>'Certainly not, without your permission.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54831' title='54831'>'And, of course, this is all quite a minor case compared with the question of who killed John Straker.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54832' title='54832'>'And you will devote yourself to that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54833' title='54833'>'On the contrary, we both go back to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> by the night train.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54834' title='54834'>I was thunderstruck by my friend's words. </span>
<span sid='54835' title='54835'>We had only been a few hours in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Devonshire&t=h'>Devonshire</a>, and that he should give up an investigation which he had begun so brilliantly was quite incomprehensible to me. </span>
<span sid='54836' title='54836'>Not a word more could I draw from him until we were back at the trainer's house. </span>
<span sid='54837' title='54837'>The Colonel and the Inspector were awaiting us in the parlour.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54838' title='54838'>'My friend and I return to town by the midnight express,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='54839' title='54839'>'We have had a charming little breath of your beautiful <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Dartmoor&t=h'>Dartmoor</a> air.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54840' title='54840'>The Inspector opened his eyes, and the Colonel's lips curled in a sneer.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54841' title='54841'>'So you despair of arresting the murderer of poor Straker,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54842' title='54842'>Holmes shrugged his shoulders. </span>
<span sid='54843' title='54843'>'There are certainly grave difficulties in the way,' said he. </span>
<span sid='54844' title='54844'>'I have every hope, however, that your horse will start upon Tuesday, and I beg that you will have your jockey in readiness. </span>
<span sid='54845' title='54845'>Might I ask for a photograph of Mr. John Straker?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54846' title='54846'>The Inspector took one from an envelope in his pocket and handed it to him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54847' title='54847'>'My dear Gregory, you anticipate all my wants. </span>
<span sid='54848' title='54848'>If I might ask you to wait here for an instant, I have a question which I should like to put to the maid.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54849' title='54849'>'I must say that I am rather disappointed in our <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> consultant,' said Colonel <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a>, bluntly, as my friend left the room. </span>
<span sid='54850' title='54850'>'I do not see that we are any further than when he came.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54851' title='54851'>'At least, you have his assurance that your horse will run,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54852' title='54852'>'Yes, I have his assurance,' said the Colonel, with a shrug of his shoulders. </span>
<span sid='54853' title='54853'>'I should prefer to have the horse.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54854' title='54854'>I was about to make some reply in defence of my friend, when he entered the room again.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54855' title='54855'>'Now, gentlemen,' said he, 'I am quite ready for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Tavistock&t=h'>Tavistock</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54856' title='54856'>As we stepped into the carriage one of the stable lads held the door open for us. </span>
<span sid='54857' title='54857'>A sudden idea seemed to occur to Holmes, for he leaned forward and touched the lad upon the sleeve.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54858' title='54858'>'You have a few sheep in the paddock,' he said 'Who attends to them?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54859' title='54859'>'I do, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54860' title='54860'>'Have you noticed anything amiss with them of late?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54861' title='54861'>'Well, sir, not of much account; but three of them have gone lame, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54862' title='54862'>I could see that Holmes was extremely pleased, for he chuckled and rubbed his hands together.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54863' title='54863'>'A long shot, Watson; a very long shot!' said he, pinching my arm. </span>
<span sid='54864' title='54864'>'Gregory, let me recommend to your attention this singular epidemic among the sheep. </span>
<span sid='54865' title='54865'>Drive on, coachman!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54866' title='54866'>Colonel <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a> still wore an expression which showed the poor opinion which he had formed of my companion's ability, but I saw by the Inspector's face that his attention had been keenly aroused.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54867' title='54867'>'You consider that to be important?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54868' title='54868'>'Exceedingly so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54869' title='54869'>'Is there any other point to which you would wish to draw my attention?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54870' title='54870'>'To the curious incident of the dog in the night time.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54871' title='54871'>'The dog did nothing in the night-time.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54872' title='54872'>'That was the curious incident,' remarked Sherlock Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54873' title='54873'>Four days later Holmes and I were again in the train bound for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Winchester&t=h'>Winchester</a>, to see the race for the Wessex Cup. </span>
<span sid='54874' title='54874'>Colonel <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a> met us, by appointment, outside the station, and we drove in his drag to the course beyond the town. </span>
<span sid='54875' title='54875'>His face was grave and his manner was cold in the extreme.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54876' title='54876'>'I have seen nothing of my horse,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54877' title='54877'>'I suppose that you would know him when you saw him?' asked Holmes. </span>
<span sid='54878' title='54878'>The Colonel was very angry. </span>
<span sid='54879' title='54879'>'I have been on the turf for twenty years, and never was asked such a question as that before,' said he. </span>
<span sid='54880' title='54880'>'A child would know Silver Blaze with his white forehead and his mottled off foreleg.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54881' title='54881'>'How is the betting?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54882' title='54882'>'Well, that is the curious part of it. </span>
<span sid='54883' title='54883'>You could have got fifteen to one yesterday, but the price has become shorter and shorter, until you can hardly get three to one now.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54884' title='54884'>'Hum!' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='54885' title='54885'>'Somebody knows something, that is clear!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54886' title='54886'>As the drag drew up in the enclosure near the grandstand, I glanced at the card to see the entries. </span>
<span sid='54887' title='54887'>It ran:</span>
<p>
<span sid='54888' title='54888'>Wessex Plate. </span>
<span sid='54889' title='54889'>50 sovs. each, h ft, with 1,000 sovs. added, for four - and five-year olds. </span>
<span sid='54890' title='54890'>Second Â£300. </span>
<span sid='54891' title='54891'>Third Â£200. </span>
<span sid='54892' title='54892'>New course (one mile and five furlongs).</span>
<p>
<span sid='54893' title='54893'>1. Mr. Heath Newton's The Negro (red cap, cinnamon jacket).</span>
<p>
<span sid='54894' title='54894'>2. Colonel Wardlaw's Pugilist (pink cap, blue and black jacket).</span>
<p>
<span sid='54895' title='54895'>3. Lord Backwater's Desborough (yellow cap and sleeves).</span>
<p>
<span sid='54896' title='54896'>4. Colonel <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a>'s Silver Blaze (black cap, red jacket)</span>
<p>
<span sid='54897' title='54897'>5. Duke of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Balmoral&t=h'>Balmoral</a>'s Iris (yellow and black stripes).</span>
<p>
<span sid='54898' title='54898'>6. Lord Singleford's Rasper (purple cap, black sleeves).</span>
<p>
<span sid='54899' title='54899'>'We scratched our other one and put all hopes on your word,' said the Colonel. </span>
<span sid='54900' title='54900'>'Why, what is that? </span>
<span sid='54901' title='54901'>Silver Blaze favourite?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54902' title='54902'>'Five to four against Silver Blaze!' roared the ring.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54903' title='54903'>'Five to four against Silver Blaze! </span>
<span sid='54904' title='54904'>Fifteen to five against Desborough! </span>
<span sid='54905' title='54905'>Five to four on the field!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54906' title='54906'>'There are the numbers up,' I cried. </span>
<span sid='54907' title='54907'>'They are all six there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54908' title='54908'>'All six there! </span>
<span sid='54909' title='54909'>Then my horse is running,' cried the Colonel, in great agitation. </span>
<span sid='54910' title='54910'>'But I don't see him. </span>
<span sid='54911' title='54911'>My colours have not passed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54912' title='54912'>'Only five have passed. </span>
<span sid='54913' title='54913'>This must be he.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54914' title='54914'>As I spoke a powerful bay horse swept out from the weighing enclosure and cantered past us, bearing on its back the well-known black and red of the Colonel.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54915' title='54915'>'That's not my horse,' cried the owner. </span>
<span sid='54916' title='54916'>'That beast has not a white hair upon its body. </span>
<span sid='54917' title='54917'>What is this that you have done, Mr. Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54918' title='54918'>'Well, well, let us see how he gets on,' said my friend, imperturbably. </span>
<span sid='54919' title='54919'>For a few minutes he gazed through my field-glass. </span>
<span sid='54920' title='54920'>'Capital! </span>
<span sid='54921' title='54921'>An excellent start!' he cried suddenly. </span>
<span sid='54922' title='54922'>'There they are, coming round the curve!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54923' title='54923'>From our drag we had a superb view as they came up the straight. </span>
<span sid='54924' title='54924'>The six horses were so close together that a carpet could have covered them, but half-way up the yellow of the Capleton stable showed to the front. </span>
<span sid='54925' title='54925'>Before they reached us, however, Desborough's bolt was shot, and the Colonel's horse, coming away with a rush, passed the post a good six lengths before its rival, the Duke of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Balmoral&t=h'>Balmoral</a>'s Iris making a bad third.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54926' title='54926'>'It's my race anyhow,' gasped the Colonel, passing his hand over his eyes. </span>
<span sid='54927' title='54927'>'I confess that I can make neither head nor tail of it. </span>
<span sid='54928' title='54928'>Don't you think that you have kept up your mystery long enough, Mr. Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54929' title='54929'>'Certainly, Colonel. </span>
<span sid='54930' title='54930'>You shall know everything.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54931' title='54931'>Let us all go round and have a look at the horse together. </span>
<span sid='54932' title='54932'>Here he is,' he continued, as we made our way into the weighing enclosure where only owners and their friends find admittance. </span>
<span sid='54933' title='54933'>'You have only to wash his face and his leg in spirits of wine and you will find that he is the same old Silver Blaze as ever.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54934' title='54934'>'You take my breath away!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54935' title='54935'>'I found him in the hands of a faker, and took the liberty of running him just as he was sent over.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54936' title='54936'>'My dear sir, you have done wonders. </span>
<span sid='54937' title='54937'>The horse looks very fit and well. </span>
<span sid='54938' title='54938'>It never went better in its life. </span>
<span sid='54939' title='54939'>I owe you a thousand apologies for having doubted your ability. </span>
<span sid='54940' title='54940'>You have done me a great service by recovering my horse. </span>
<span sid='54941' title='54941'>You would do me a greater still if you could lay your hands on the murderer of John Straker.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54942' title='54942'>'I have done so,' said Holmes, quietly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54943' title='54943'>The Colonel and I stared at him in amazement. </span>
<span sid='54944' title='54944'>'You have got him! </span>
<span sid='54945' title='54945'>Where is he, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54946' title='54946'>'He is here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54947' title='54947'>'Here! </span>
<span sid='54948' title='54948'>Where?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54949' title='54949'>'In my company at the present moment.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54950' title='54950'>The Colonel flushed angrily. </span>
<span sid='54951' title='54951'>'I quite recognize that I am under obligations to you, Mr. Holmes,' said he, 'but I must regard what you have just said as either a very bad joke or an insult.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54952' title='54952'>Sherlock Holmes laughed. </span>
<span sid='54953' title='54953'>'I assure you that I have not associated you with the crime, Colonel,' said he; 'the real murderer is standing immediately behind you!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54954' title='54954'>He stepped past and laid his hand upon the glossy neck of the thoroughbred.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54955' title='54955'>'The horse!' cried both the Colonel and myself.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54956' title='54956'>'Yes, the horse. </span>
<span sid='54957' title='54957'>And it may lessen his guilt if I say that it was done in self-defence, and that John Straker was a man who was entirely unworthy of your confidence. </span>
<span sid='54958' title='54958'>But there goes the bell; and as I stand to win a little on this next race, I shall defer a more lengthy explanation until a more fitting time.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54959' title='54959'>We had the corner of a Pullman car to ourselves that evening as we whirled back to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, and I fancy that the journey was a short one to Colonel <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a> as well as to myself, as we listened to our companion's narrative of the events which had occurred at the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Dartmoor&t=h'>Dartmoor</a> training stables upon that Monday night, and the means by which he had unravelled them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54960' title='54960'>'I confess,' said he, 'that any theories which I had formed from the newspaper reports were entirely erroneous. </span>
<span sid='54961' title='54961'>And yet there were indications there, had they not been overlaid by other details which concealed their true import. </span>
<span sid='54962' title='54962'>I went to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Devonshire&t=h'>Devonshire</a> with the conviction that Fitzroy Simpson was the true culprit, although, of course, I saw that the evidence against him was by no means complete.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54963' title='54963'>'It was while I was in the carriage, just as we reached the trainer's house, that the immense significance of the curried mutton occurred to me. </span>
<span sid='54964' title='54964'>You may remember that I was distrait, and remained sitting after you had all alighted. </span>
<span sid='54965' title='54965'>I was marvelling in my own mind how I could possibly have overlooked so obvious a clue.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54966' title='54966'>'I confess,' said the Colonel, 'that even now I cannot see how it helps us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54967' title='54967'>'It was the first link in my chain of reasoning. </span>
<span sid='54968' title='54968'>Powdered opium is by no means tasteless. </span>
<span sid='54969' title='54969'>The flavour is not disagreeable, but it is perceptible. </span>
<span sid='54970' title='54970'>Were it mixed with any ordinary dish, the eater would undoubtedly detect it, and would probably eat no more. </span>
<span sid='54971' title='54971'>A curry was exactly the medium which would disguise this taste. </span>
<span sid='54972' title='54972'>By no possible supposition could this stranger, Fitzroy Simpson, have caused curry to be served in the trainer's family that night, and it is surely too monstrous a coincidence to suppose that he happened to come along with powdered opium upon the very night when a dish happened to be served which would disguise the flavour. </span>
<span sid='54973' title='54973'>That is unthinkable. </span>
<span sid='54974' title='54974'>Therefore Simpson becomes eliminated from the case, and our attention centres upon Straker and his wife, the only two people who could have chosen curried mutton for supper that night. </span>
<span sid='54975' title='54975'>The opium was added after the dish was set aside for the stable boy, for the others had the same for supper with no ill effects. </span>
<span sid='54976' title='54976'>Which of them, then, had access to that dish without the maid seeing them?</span>
<p>
<span sid='54977' title='54977'>'Before deciding that question I had grasped the significance of the silence of the dog, for one true inference invariably suggests others. </span>
<span sid='54978' title='54978'>The Simpson incident had shown me that a dog was kept in the stables, and yet, though someone had been in and had fetched out a horse, he had not barked enough to arouse the two lads in the loft. </span>
<span sid='54979' title='54979'>Obviously the midnight visitor was someone whom the dog knew well.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54980' title='54980'>'I was already convinced, or almost convinced, that John Straker went down to the stables in the dead of the night and took out Silver Blaze. </span>
<span sid='54981' title='54981'>For what purpose? </span>
<span sid='54982' title='54982'>For a dishonest one, obviously, or why should he drug his own stable boy? </span>
<span sid='54983' title='54983'>And yet I was at a loss to know why. </span>
<span sid='54984' title='54984'>There have been cases before now where trainers have made sure of great sums of money by laying against their own horses, through agents, and then prevented them from winning by fraud. </span>
<span sid='54985' title='54985'>Sometimes it is a pulling jockey. </span>
<span sid='54986' title='54986'>Sometimes it is some surer and subtler means. </span>
<span sid='54987' title='54987'>What was it here? </span>
<span sid='54988' title='54988'>I hoped that the contents of his pockets might help me to form a conclusion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54989' title='54989'>'And they did so. </span>
<span sid='54990' title='54990'>You cannot have forgotten the singular knife which was found in the dead man's hand, a knife which certainly no sane man would choose for a weapon. </span>
<span sid='54991' title='54991'>It was, as Dr. Watson told us, a form of knife which is used for the most delicate operations known in surgery. </span>
<span sid='54992' title='54992'>And it was to be used for a delicate operation that night. </span>
<span sid='54993' title='54993'>You must know, with your wide experience of turf matters, Colonel <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a>, that it is possible to make a slight nick upon the tendons of a horse's ham, and to do it subcutaneously so as to leave absolutely no trace. </span>
<span sid='54994' title='54994'>A horse so treated would develop a slight lameness which would be put down to a strain in exercise or a touch of rheumatism, but never to foul play.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='54995' title='54995'>'Villain! </span>
<span sid='54996' title='54996'>Scoundrel!' cried the Colonel.</span>
<p>
<span sid='54997' title='54997'>'We have here the explanation of why John Straker wished to take the horse out on to the moor. </span>
<span sid='54998' title='54998'>So spirited a creature would have certainly roused the soundest of sleepers when it felt the prick of the knife. </span>
<span sid='54999' title='54999'>It was absolutely necessary to do it in the open air.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55000' title='55000'>'I have been blind!' cried the Colonel. </span>
<span sid='55001' title='55001'>'Of course, that was why he needed the candle, and struck the match.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55002' title='55002'>'Undoubtedly. </span>
<span sid='55003' title='55003'>But in examining his belongings, I was fortunate enough to discover, not only the method of the crime, but even its motives. </span>
<span sid='55004' title='55004'>As a man of the world, Colonel, you know that men do not carry other people's bills about in their pockets. </span>
<span sid='55005' title='55005'>We have most of us quite enough to do to settle our own. </span>
<span sid='55006' title='55006'>I at once concluded that Straker was leading a double life, and keeping a second establishment. </span>
<span sid='55007' title='55007'>The nature of the bill showed that there was a lady in the case, and one who had expensive tastes. </span>
<span sid='55008' title='55008'>Liberal as you are with your servants, one hardly expects that they can buy twenty-guinea walking dresses for their women. </span>
<span sid='55009' title='55009'>I questioned Mrs. Straker as to the dress without her knowing it, and having satisfied myself that it had never reached her, I made a note of the milliner's address, and felt that by calling there with Straker's photograph, I could easily dispose of the mythical Darbyshire.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55010' title='55010'>'From that time on all was plain. </span>
<span sid='55011' title='55011'>Straker had led out the horse to a hollow where his light would be invisible. </span>
<span sid='55012' title='55012'>Simpson, in his flight, had dropped his cravat, and Straker had picked it up with some idea, perhaps, that he might use it in securing the horse's leg. </span>
<span sid='55013' title='55013'>Once in the hollow he had got behind the horse, and had struck a light, but the creature, frightened at the sudden glare, and with the strange instinct of animals feeling that some mischief was intended, had lashed out, and the steel shoe had struck Straker full on the forehead. </span>
<span sid='55014' title='55014'>He had already, in spite of the rain, taken off his overcoat in order to do his delicate task, and so, as he fell, his knife gashed his thigh. </span>
<span sid='55015' title='55015'>Do I make it clear?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55016' title='55016'>'Wonderful!' cried the Colonel. </span>
<span sid='55017' title='55017'>'Wonderful! </span>
<span sid='55018' title='55018'>You might have been there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55019' title='55019'>'My final shot was, I confess, a very long one. </span>
<span sid='55020' title='55020'>It struck me that so astute a man as Straker would not undertake this delicate tendon-nicking without a little practice. </span>
<span sid='55021' title='55021'>What could he practise on? </span>
<span sid='55022' title='55022'>My eyes fell upon the sheep, and I asked a question which, rather to my surprise, showed that my surmise was correct.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55023' title='55023'>'You have made it perfectly clear, Mr. Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55024' title='55024'>'When I returned to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> I called upon the milliner, who at once recognized Straker as an excellent customer, of the name of Darbyshire, who had a very dashing wife with a strong partiality for expensive dresses. </span>
<span sid='55025' title='55025'>I have no doubt that this woman had plunged him over head and ears in debt, and so led him into this miserable plot.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55026' title='55026'>'You have explained all but one thing,' cried the Colonel. </span>
<span sid='55027' title='55027'>'Where was the horse?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55028' title='55028'>'Ah, it bolted and was cared for by one of your neighbours. </span>
<span sid='55029' title='55029'>We must have an amnesty in that direction, I think. </span>
<span sid='55030' title='55030'>This is <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Clapham Junction&t=h'>Clapham Junction</a>, if I am not mistaken, and we shall be in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Victoria&t=h'>Victoria</a> in less than ten minutes. </span>
<span sid='55031' title='55031'>If you care to smoke a cigar in our rooms, Colonel, I shall be happy to give you any other details which might interest you.'</span>
