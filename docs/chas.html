<h1><span sid='26073' title='26073'>The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton</span></h1>
<p class="subtitle">Arthur Conan Doyle<label for="sn-meta-chas" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-meta-chas" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><!--googleoff: all--><b>Story Number</b>: 34<br><b>Published in</b>: The Collier's magazine, 26 March 1904 (US)<br><b>Collected in</b>: The Return of Sherlock Holmes<!--googleon: all--></span></p>
<p>
<span sid='26074' title='26074'>It is years since the incidents of which I speak took place, and yet it is with diffidence that I allude to them. </span>
<span sid='26075' title='26075'>For a long time, even with the utmost discretion and reticence, it would have been impossible to make the facts public; but now the principal person concerned is beyond the reach of human law, and with due suppression the story may be told in such fashion as to injure no one. </span>
<span sid='26076' title='26076'>It records an absolutely unique experience in the career both of Mr Sherlock Holmes and of myself. </span>
<span sid='26077' title='26077'>The reader will excuse me if I conceal the date or any other fact by which he might trace the actual occurrence.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26078' title='26078'>We had been out for one of our evening rambles, Holmes and I, and had returned about six o'clock on a cold, frosty winter's evening. </span>
<span sid='26079' title='26079'>As Holmes turned up the lamp the light fell upon a card on the table. </span>
<span sid='26080' title='26080'>He glanced at it, and then, with an ejaculation of disgust, threw it on the floor. </span>
<span sid='26081' title='26081'>I picked it up and read:</span>
<p>
<span sid='26082' title='26082'>CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON,</span>
<p>
<span sid='26083' title='26083'>APPLEDORE TOWERS,</span>
<p>
<span sid='26084' title='26084'>HAMPSTEAD.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26085' title='26085'>Agent</span>
<p>
<span sid='26086' title='26086'>'Who is he?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26087' title='26087'>'The worst man in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>,' Holmes answered, as he sat down and stretched his legs before the fire. </span>
<span sid='26088' title='26088'>'Is anything on the back of the card?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26089' title='26089'>I turned it over.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26090' title='26090'>'Will call at 6.30. - CAM,' I read.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26091' title='26091'>'Hum! </span>
<span sid='26092' title='26092'>He's about due. </span>
<span sid='26093' title='26093'>Do you feel a creeping, shrinking sensation, Watson, when you stand before the serpents in the Zoo and see the slithery, gliding, venomous creatures, with their deadly eyes and wicked, flattened faces? </span>
<span sid='26094' title='26094'>Well, that's how Milverton impresses me. </span>
<span sid='26095' title='26095'>I've had to do with fifty murderers in my career, but the worst of them never gave me the repulsion which I have for this fellow. </span>
<span sid='26096' title='26096'>And yet I can't get out of doing business with him - indeed, he is here at my invitation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26097' title='26097'>'But who is he?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26098' title='26098'>'I'll tell you, Watson. </span>
<span sid='26099' title='26099'>He is the king of all the blackmailers. </span>
<span sid='26100' title='26100'>God help the man, and still more the woman, whose secret and reputation come into the power of Milverton. </span>
<span sid='26101' title='26101'>With a smiling face and a heart of marble he will squeeze and squeeze until he has drained them dry. </span>
<span sid='26102' title='26102'>The fellow is a genius in his way, and would have made his mark in some more savoury trade. </span>
<span sid='26103' title='26103'>His method is as follows: he allows it to be known that he is prepared to pay very high sums for letters which compromise people of wealth or position. </span>
<span sid='26104' title='26104'>He receives these wares not only from treacherous valets or maids, but frequently from genteel ruffians who have gained the confidence and affection of trusting women. </span>
<span sid='26105' title='26105'>He deals with no niggard hand. </span>
<span sid='26106' title='26106'>I happen to know that he paid seven hundred pounds to a footman for a note two lines in length, and that the ruin of a noble family was the result. </span>
<span sid='26107' title='26107'>Everything which is in the market goes to Milverton, and there are hundreds in this great city who turn white at his name. </span>
<span sid='26108' title='26108'>No one knows where his grip may fall, for he is far too rich and far too cunning to work from hand to mouth. </span>
<span sid='26109' title='26109'>He will hold a card back for years in order to play it at the moment when the stake is best worth winning. </span>
<span sid='26110' title='26110'>I have said that he is the worst man in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, and I would ask you how could one compare the ruffian who in hot blood bludgeons his mate with this man, who methodically and at his leisure tortures the soul and wrings the nerves in order to add to his already swollen money-bags?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26111' title='26111'>I had seldom heard my friend speak with such intensity of feeling.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26112' title='26112'>'But surely,' said I, 'the fellow must be within the grasp of the law?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26113' title='26113'>'Technically, no doubt, but practically not. </span>
<span sid='26114' title='26114'>What would it profit a woman, for example, to get him a few months' imprisonment if her own ruin must immediately follow? </span>
<span sid='26115' title='26115'>His victims dare not hit back. </span>
<span sid='26116' title='26116'>If ever he blackmailed an innocent person, then, indeed, we should have him; but he is as cunning as the Devil. </span>
<span sid='26117' title='26117'>No, no; we must find other ways to fight him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26118' title='26118'>'And why is he here?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26119' title='26119'>'Because an illustrious client has placed her piteous case in my hands. </span>
<span sid='26120' title='26120'>It is the Lady Eva Brackwell, the most beautiful debutante of last season. </span>
<span sid='26121' title='26121'>She is to be married in a fortnight to the Earl of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Dovercourt&t=h'>Dovercourt</a>. </span>
<span sid='26122' title='26122'>This fiend has several imprudent letters - imprudent, Watson, nothing worse -  which were written to an impecunious young squire in the country. </span>
<span sid='26123' title='26123'>They would suffice to break off the match. </span>
<span sid='26124' title='26124'>Milverton will send the letters to the Earl unless a large sum of money is paid him. </span>
<span sid='26125' title='26125'>I have been commissioned to meet him, and - to make the best terms I can.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26126' title='26126'>At that instant there was a clatter and a rattle in the street below. </span>
<span sid='26127' title='26127'>Looking down I saw a stately carriage and pair, the brilliant lamps gleaming on the glossy haunches of the noble chestnuts. </span>
<span sid='26128' title='26128'>A footman opened the door, and a small, stout man in a shaggy astrakhan overcoat descended. </span>
<span sid='26129' title='26129'>A minute later he was in the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26130' title='26130'>Charles Augustus Milverton was a man of fifty, with a large, intellectual head, a round, plump, hairless face, a perpetual frozen smile, and two keen grey eyes, which gleamed brightly from behind broad, golden-rimmed glasses. </span>
<span sid='26131' title='26131'>There was something of Mr Pickwick's benevolence in his appearance, marred only by the insincerity of the fixed smile and by the hard glitter of those restless and penetrating eyes. </span>
<span sid='26132' title='26132'>His voice was as smooth and suave as his countenance, as he advanced with a plump little hand extended, murmuring his regret for having missed us at his first visit.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26133' title='26133'>Holmes disregarded the outstretched hand and looked at him with a face of granite. </span>
<span sid='26134' title='26134'>Milverton's smile broadened; he shrugged his shoulders, removed his overcoat, folded it with great deliberation over the back of a chair, and then took a seat.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26135' title='26135'>'This gentleman,' said he, with a wave in my direction. </span>
<span sid='26136' title='26136'>'Is it discreet? </span>
<span sid='26137' title='26137'>Is it right?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26138' title='26138'>'Dr Watson is my friend and partner.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26139' title='26139'>'Very good, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='26140' title='26140'>It is only in your client's interests that I protested. </span>
<span sid='26141' title='26141'>The matter is so very delicate-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26142' title='26142'>'Dr Watson has already heard of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26143' title='26143'>'Then we can proceed to business. </span>
<span sid='26144' title='26144'>You say that you are acting for Lady Eva. </span>
<span sid='26145' title='26145'>Has she empowered you to accept my terms?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26146' title='26146'>'What are your terms?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26147' title='26147'>'Seven thousand pounds.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26148' title='26148'>'And the alternative?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26149' title='26149'>'My dear sir, it is painful to me to discuss it; but if the money is not paid on the 14th there certainly will be no marriage on the 18th.' </span>
<span sid='26150' title='26150'>His insufferable smile was more complacent than ever. </span>
<span sid='26151' title='26151'>Holmes thought for a little.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26152' title='26152'>'You appear to me', he said at last, 'to be taking matters too much for granted. </span>
<span sid='26153' title='26153'>I am, of course, familiar with the contents of these letters. </span>
<span sid='26154' title='26154'>My client will certainly do what I may advise. </span>
<span sid='26155' title='26155'>I shall counsel her to tell her future husband the whole story and to trust to his generosity.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26156' title='26156'>Milverton chuckled.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26157' title='26157'>'You evidently do not know the Earl,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26158' title='26158'>From the baffled look upon Holmes's face I could clearly see that he did.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26159' title='26159'>'What harm is there in the letters?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26160' title='26160'>'They are sprightly - very sprightly,' Milverton answered. </span>
<span sid='26161' title='26161'>'The lady was a charming correspondent. </span>
<span sid='26162' title='26162'>But I can assure you that the Earl of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Dovercourt&t=h'>Dovercourt</a> would fail to appreciate them. </span>
<span sid='26163' title='26163'>However, since you think otherwise, we will let it rest at that. </span>
<span sid='26164' title='26164'>It is purely a matter of business. </span>
<span sid='26165' title='26165'>If you think that it is in the best interests of your client that these letters should be placed in the hands of the Earl, then you would indeed be foolish to pay so large a sum of money to regain them.' </span>
<span sid='26166' title='26166'>He rose and seized his astrakhan coat.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26167' title='26167'>Holmes was grey with anger and mortification.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26168' title='26168'>'Wait a little,' he said. </span>
<span sid='26169' title='26169'>'You go too fast. </span>
<span sid='26170' title='26170'>We would certainly make every effort to avoid scandal in so delicate a matter.' </span>
<span sid='26171' title='26171'>Milverton relapsed into his chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26172' title='26172'>'I was sure that you would see it in that light,' he purred.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26173' title='26173'>'At the same time,' Holmes continued, 'Lady Eva is not a wealthy woman. </span>
<span sid='26174' title='26174'>I assure you that two thousand pounds would be a drain upon her resources, and that the sum you name is utterly beyond her power. </span>
<span sid='26175' title='26175'>I beg, therefore, that you will moderate your demands, and that you will return the letters at the price I indicate, which is, I assure you, the highest that you can get.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26176' title='26176'>Milverton's smile broadened and his eyes twinkled humorously.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26177' title='26177'>'I am aware that what you say is true about the lady's resources,' said he. </span>
<span sid='26178' title='26178'>'At the same time, you must admit that the occasion of a lady's marriage is a very suitable time for her friends and relatives to make some little effort upon her behalf. </span>
<span sid='26179' title='26179'>They may hesitate as to an acceptable wedding present. </span>
<span sid='26180' title='26180'>Let me assure them that this little bundle of letters would give more joy than all the candelabra and butter- dishes in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26181' title='26181'>'It is impossible,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26182' title='26182'>'Dear me, dear me, how unfortunate!' cried Milverton, taking out a bulky pocket-book. </span>
<span sid='26183' title='26183'>'I cannot help thinking that ladies are ill-advised in not making an effort. </span>
<span sid='26184' title='26184'>Look at this!' </span>
<span sid='26185' title='26185'>He held up a little note with a coat-of-arms upon the envelope. </span>
<span sid='26186' title='26186'>'That belongs to - well, perhaps it is hardly fair to tell the name until to-morrow morning. </span>
<span sid='26187' title='26187'>But at that time it will be in the hands of the lady's husband. </span>
<span sid='26188' title='26188'>And all because she will not find a beggarly sum which she could get in an hour by turning her diamonds into paste. </span>
<span sid='26189' title='26189'>It is such a pity. </span>
<span sid='26190' title='26190'>Now, you remember the sudden end of the engagement between the Honourable Miss Miles and Colonel Dorking? </span>
<span sid='26191' title='26191'>Only two days before the wedding there was a paragraph in the Morning Post to say that it was all off. </span>
<span sid='26192' title='26192'>And why? </span>
<span sid='26193' title='26193'>It is almost incredible, but the absurd sum of twelve hundred pounds would have settled the whole question. </span>
<span sid='26194' title='26194'>Is it not pitiful? </span>
<span sid='26195' title='26195'>And there I find you, a man of sense, boggling about terms when your client's future and honour are at stake. </span>
<span sid='26196' title='26196'>You surprise me, Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26197' title='26197'>'What I say is true,' Holmes answered. </span>
<span sid='26198' title='26198'>'The money cannot be found. </span>
<span sid='26199' title='26199'>Surely it is better for you to take the substantial sum which I offer than to ruin this woman's career, which can profit you in no way?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26200' title='26200'>'There you make a mistake, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='26201' title='26201'>An exposure would profit me indirectly to a considerable extent. </span>
<span sid='26202' title='26202'>I have eight or ten similar cases maturing. </span>
<span sid='26203' title='26203'>If it was circulated among them that I had made a severe example of the Lady Eva I should find all of them much more open to reason. </span>
<span sid='26204' title='26204'>You see my point?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26205' title='26205'>Holmes sprang from his chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26206' title='26206'>'Get behind him, Watson. </span>
<span sid='26207' title='26207'>Don't let him out! </span>
<span sid='26208' title='26208'>Now, sir, let us see the contents of that note-book.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26209' title='26209'>Milverton had glided as quick as a rat to the side of the room, and stood with his back against the wall.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26210' title='26210'>'Mr Holmes, Mr Holmes!' he said, turning the front of his coat and exhibiting the butt of a large revolver, which projected from the inside pocket. </span>
<span sid='26211' title='26211'>'I have been expecting you to do something original. </span>
<span sid='26212' title='26212'>This has been done so often, and what good has ever come from it? </span>
<span sid='26213' title='26213'>I assure you that I am armed to the teeth, and I am perfectly prepared to use my weapon, knowing that the law will support me. </span>
<span sid='26214' title='26214'>Besides, your supposition that I would bring the letters here in a notebook is entirely mistaken. </span>
<span sid='26215' title='26215'>I would do nothing so foolish. </span>
<span sid='26216' title='26216'>And now, gentlemen, I have one or two little interviews this evening, and it is a long drive to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Hampstead&t=h'>Hampstead</a>.' </span>
<span sid='26217' title='26217'>He stepped forward, took up his coat, laid his hand on his revolver, and turned to the door. </span>
<span sid='26218' title='26218'>I picked up a chair, but Holmes shook his head, and I laid it down again. </span>
<span sid='26219' title='26219'>With a bow, a smile, and a twinkle Milverton was out of the room, and a few moments after we heard the slam of the carriage door and the rattle of the wheels as he drove away.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26220' title='26220'>Holmes sat motionless by the fire, his hands buried deep in his trouser pockets, his chin sunk upon his breast, his eyes fixed upon the glowing embers. </span>
<span sid='26221' title='26221'>For half an hour he was silent and still. </span>
<span sid='26222' title='26222'>Then, with the gesture of a man who has taken his decision, he sprang to his feet and passed into his bedroom. </span>
<span sid='26223' title='26223'>A little later a rakish young workman with a goatee beard and a swagger lit his clay pipe at the lamp before descending into the street. </span>
<span sid='26224' title='26224'>'I'll be back some time, Watson,' said he, and vanished into the night. </span>
<span sid='26225' title='26225'>I understood that he had opened his campaign against Charles Augustus Milverton; but I little dreamed the strange shape which that campaign was destined to take.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26226' title='26226'>For some days Holmes came and went at all hours in this attire, but beyond a remark that his time was spent at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Hampstead&t=h'>Hampstead</a>, and that it was not wasted, I knew nothing of what he was doing. </span>
<span sid='26227' title='26227'>At last, however, on a wild, tempestuous evening, when the wind screamed and rattled against the windows, he returned from his last expedition, and, having removed his disguise, he sat before the fire and laughed heartily in his silent, inward fashion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26228' title='26228'>'You would not call me a marrying man, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26229' title='26229'>'No, indeed!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26230' title='26230'>'You will be interested to hear that I am engaged.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26231' title='26231'>'My dear fellow! I congrat-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26232' title='26232'>'To Milverton's housemaid.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26233' title='26233'>'Good heavens, Holmes!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26234' title='26234'>'I wanted information, Watson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26235' title='26235'>'Surely you have gone too far?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26236' title='26236'>'It was a most necessary step. </span>
<span sid='26237' title='26237'>I am a plumber with a rising business, Escott by name. </span>
<span sid='26238' title='26238'>I have walked out with her each evening, and I have talked with her. </span>
<span sid='26239' title='26239'>Good heavens, those talks! </span>
<span sid='26240' title='26240'>However, I have got all I wanted. </span>
<span sid='26241' title='26241'>I know Milverton's house as I know the palm of my hand.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26242' title='26242'>'But the girl, Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26243' title='26243'>He shrugged his shoulders.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26244' title='26244'>'You can't help it, my dear Watson. </span>
<span sid='26245' title='26245'>You must play your cards as best you can when such a stake is on the table. </span>
<span sid='26246' title='26246'>However, I rejoice to say that I have a hated rival who will certainly cut me out the instant that my back is turned. </span>
<span sid='26247' title='26247'>What a splendid night it is!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26248' title='26248'>'You like this weather?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26249' title='26249'>'It suits my purpose. </span>
<span sid='26250' title='26250'>Watson, I mean to burgle Milverton's house to-night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26251' title='26251'>I had a catching of the breath, and my skin went cold at the words, which were slowly uttered in a tone of concentrated resolution. </span>
<span sid='26252' title='26252'>As a flash of lightning in the night shows up in an instant every detail of a wide landscape, so at one glance I seemed to see every possible result of such an action - the detection, the capture, the honoured career ending in irreparable failure and disgrace, my friend himself lying at the mercy of the odious Milverton.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26253' title='26253'>'For God's sake, Holmes, think what you are doing!' I cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26254' title='26254'>'My dear fellow, I have given it every consideration. </span>
<span sid='26255' title='26255'>I am never precipitate in my actions, nor would I adopt so energetic and indeed so dangerous a course if any other were possible. </span>
<span sid='26256' title='26256'>Let us look at the matter clearly and fairly. </span>
<span sid='26257' title='26257'>I suppose that you will admit that the action is morally justifiable, though technically criminal. </span>
<span sid='26258' title='26258'>To burgle his house is no more than to forcibly take his pocket-book - an action in which you were prepared to aid me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26259' title='26259'>I turned it over in my mind.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26260' title='26260'>'Yes,' I said; 'it is morally justifiable so long as our object is to take no articles save those which are used for an illegal purpose.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26261' title='26261'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='26262' title='26262'>Since it is morally justifiable, I have only to consider the question of personal risk. </span>
<span sid='26263' title='26263'>Surely a gentleman should not lay much stress upon this when a lady is in most desperate need of his help?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26264' title='26264'>'You will be in such a false position.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26265' title='26265'>'Well, that is part of the risk. </span>
<span sid='26266' title='26266'>There is no other possible way of regaining these letters. </span>
<span sid='26267' title='26267'>The unfortunate lady has not the money, and there are none of her people in whom she could confide. </span>
<span sid='26268' title='26268'>To-morrow is the last day of grace, and unless we can get the letters to-night this villain will be as good as his word, and will bring about her ruin. </span>
<span sid='26269' title='26269'>I must, therefore, abandon my client to her fate, or I must play this last card. </span>
<span sid='26270' title='26270'>Between ourselves, Watson, it's a sporting duel between this fellow Milverton and me. </span>
<span sid='26271' title='26271'>He had, as you saw, the best of the first exchanges; but my self-respect and my reputation are concerned to fight it to a finish.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26272' title='26272'>'Well, I don't like it; but I suppose it must be,' said I. </span>
<span sid='26273' title='26273'>'When do we start?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26274' title='26274'>'You are not coming?</span>
<p>
<span sid='26275' title='26275'>'Then you are not going,' said I. </span>
<span sid='26276' title='26276'>'I give you my word of honour - and I never broke it in my life - that I will take a cab straight to the police-station and give you away unless you let me share this adventure with you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26277' title='26277'>'You can't help me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26278' title='26278'>'How do you know that? </span>
<span sid='26279' title='26279'>You can't tell what may happen. </span>
<span sid='26280' title='26280'>Anyway, my resolution is taken. </span>
<span sid='26281' title='26281'>Other people besides you have self-respect and even reputations.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26282' title='26282'>Holmes had looked annoyed, but his brow cleared, and he clapped me on the shoulder.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26283' title='26283'>'Well, well, my dear fellow, be it so. </span>
<span sid='26284' title='26284'>We have shared the same room for some years, and it would be amusing if we ended by sharing the same cell. </span>
<span sid='26285' title='26285'>You know, Watson, I don't mind confessing to you that I have always had an idea that I would have made a highly efficient criminal. </span>
<span sid='26286' title='26286'>This is the chance of my lifetime in that direction. </span>
<span sid='26287' title='26287'>See here!' </span>
<span sid='26288' title='26288'>He took a neat little leather case out of a drawer, and opening it he exhibited a number of shining instruments. </span>
<span sid='26289' title='26289'>This is a first-class, up-to-date burgling kit, with nickel-plated jemmy, diamond-tipped glass-cutter, adaptable keys, and every modern improvement which the march of civilization demands. </span>
<span sid='26290' title='26290'>Here, too, is my dark lantern. </span>
<span sid='26291' title='26291'>Everything is in order. </span>
<span sid='26292' title='26292'>Have you a pair of silent shoes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26293' title='26293'>'I have rubber-soled tennis shoes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26294' title='26294'>'Excellent. </span>
<span sid='26295' title='26295'>And a mask?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26296' title='26296'>'I can make a couple out of black silk.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26297' title='26297'>'I can see that you have a strong natural turn for this sort of thing. </span>
<span sid='26298' title='26298'>Very good; do you make the masks. </span>
<span sid='26299' title='26299'>We shall have some cold supper before we start. </span>
<span sid='26300' title='26300'>It is now nine-thirty. </span>
<span sid='26301' title='26301'>At eleven we shall drive as far as <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Church Row&t=h'>Church Row</a>. </span>
<span sid='26302' title='26302'>It is a quarter of an hour's walk from there to Appledore Towers. </span>
<span sid='26303' title='26303'>We shall be at work before midnight. </span>
<span sid='26304' title='26304'>Milverton is a heavy sleeper, and retires punctually at ten-thirty. </span>
<span sid='26305' title='26305'>With any luck we should be back here by two, with the Lady Eva's letters in my pocket.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26306' title='26306'>Holmes and I put on our dress-clothes, so that we might appear to be two theatre-goers homeward bound. </span>
<span sid='26307' title='26307'>In <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Oxford Street&t=h'>Oxford Street</a> we picked up a hansom and drove to an address in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Hampstead&t=h'>Hampstead</a>. </span>
<span sid='26308' title='26308'>Here we paid off our cab, and with our great-coats buttoned up - for it was bitterly cold, and the wind seemed to blow through us - we walked along the edge of the Heath.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26309' title='26309'>'It's a business that needs delicate treatment,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='26310' title='26310'>'These documents are contained in a safe in the fellow's study, and the study is the ante-room of his bedchamber. </span>
<span sid='26311' title='26311'>On the other hand, like all these stout, little men who do themselves well, he is a plethoric sleeper. </span>
<span sid='26312' title='26312'>Agatha - that's my fiancÃ©e - says it is a joke in the servants' hall that it's impossible to wake the master. </span>
<span sid='26313' title='26313'>He has a secretary who is devoted to his interests and never budges from the study all day. </span>
<span sid='26314' title='26314'>That's why we are going at night. </span>
<span sid='26315' title='26315'>Then he has a beast of a dog which roams the garden. </span>
<span sid='26316' title='26316'>I met Agatha late the last two evenings, and she locks the brute up so as to give me a clear run. </span>
<span sid='26317' title='26317'>This is the house, this big one in its own grounds. </span>
<span sid='26318' title='26318'>Through the gate - now to the right among the laurels. </span>
<span sid='26319' title='26319'>We might put on our masks here, I think. </span>
<span sid='26320' title='26320'>You see, there is not a glimmer of light in any of the windows, and everything is working splendidly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26321' title='26321'>With our black silk face-coverings, which turned us into two of the most truculent figures in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, we stole up to the silent, gloomy house. </span>
<span sid='26322' title='26322'>A sort of tiled veranda extended along one side of it, lined by several windows and two doors.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26323' title='26323'>'That's his bedroom,' Holmes whispered. </span>
<span sid='26324' title='26324'>'This door opens straight into the study. </span>
<span sid='26325' title='26325'>It would suit us best, but it is bolted as well as locked, and we should make too much noise getting in. </span>
<span sid='26326' title='26326'>Come round here. </span>
<span sid='26327' title='26327'>There's a greenhouse which opens into the drawing-room.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26328' title='26328'>The place was locked, but Holmes removed a circle of glass and turned the key from the inside. </span>
<span sid='26329' title='26329'>An instant afterwards he had closed the door behind us, and we had become felons in the eyes of the law. </span>
<span sid='26330' title='26330'>The thick, warm air of the conservatory and the rich, choking fragrance of exotic plants took us by the throat. </span>
<span sid='26331' title='26331'>He seized my hand in the darkness and led me swiftly past banks of shrubs which brushed against our faces. </span>
<span sid='26332' title='26332'>Holmes had remarkable powers, carefully cultivated, of seeing in the dark. </span>
<span sid='26333' title='26333'>Still holding my hand in one of his, he opened a door, and I was vaguely conscious that we had entered a large room in which a cigar had been smoked not long before. </span>
<span sid='26334' title='26334'>He felt his way among the furniture, opened another door, and closed it behind us. </span>
<span sid='26335' title='26335'>Putting out my hand I felt several coats hanging from the wall, and I understood that I was in a passage. </span>
<span sid='26336' title='26336'>We passed along it, and Holmes very gently opened a door upon the right-hand side. </span>
<span sid='26337' title='26337'>Something rushed out at us, and my heart sprang into my mouth, but I could have laughed when I realized that it was the cat. </span>
<span sid='26338' title='26338'>A fire was burning in this new room, and again the air was heavy with tobacco smoke. </span>
<span sid='26339' title='26339'>Holmes entered on tiptoe, waited for me to follow, and then very gently closed the door. </span>
<span sid='26340' title='26340'>We were in Milverton's study, and a portiere at the farther side showed the entrance to his bedroom.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26341' title='26341'>It was a good fire, and the room was illuminated by it. </span>
<span sid='26342' title='26342'>Near the door I saw the gleam of an electric switch, but it was unnecessary, even if it had been safe, to turn it on. </span>
<span sid='26343' title='26343'>At one side of the fireplace was a heavy curtain, which covered the bay window we had seen from outside. </span>
<span sid='26344' title='26344'>On the other side was the door which communicated with the veranda. </span>
<span sid='26345' title='26345'>A desk stood in the centre, with a turning chair of shining red leather. </span>
<span sid='26346' title='26346'>Opposite was a large bookcase, with a marble burst of Athene on the top. </span>
<span sid='26347' title='26347'>In the corner between the bookcase and the wall there stood a tall green safe, the firelight flashing back from the polished brass knobs upon its face. </span>
<span sid='26348' title='26348'>Holmes stole across and looked at it. </span>
<span sid='26349' title='26349'>Then he crept to the door of the bedroom, and stood with slanting head listening intently. </span>
<span sid='26350' title='26350'>No sound came from within. </span>
<span sid='26351' title='26351'>Meanwhile it had struck me that it would be wise to secure our retreat through the outer door, so I examined it. </span>
<span sid='26352' title='26352'>To my amazement it was neither locked nor bolted! </span>
<span sid='26353' title='26353'>I touched Holmes on the arm, and he turned his masked face in that direction. </span>
<span sid='26354' title='26354'>I saw him start, and he was evidently as surprised as I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26355' title='26355'>'I don't like it,' he whispered, putting his lips to my very ear. </span>
<span sid='26356' title='26356'>'I can't quite make it out. </span>
<span sid='26357' title='26357'>Anyhow, we have no time to lose.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26358' title='26358'>'Can I do anything?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26359' title='26359'>'Yes; stand by the door. </span>
<span sid='26360' title='26360'>If you hear anyone come, bolt it on the inside, and we can get away as we came. </span>
<span sid='26361' title='26361'>If they come the other way, we can get through the door if our job is done, or hide behind these window curtains if it is not. </span>
<span sid='26362' title='26362'>Do you understand?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26363' title='26363'>I nodded and stood by the door. </span>
<span sid='26364' title='26364'>My first feeling of fear had passed away, and I thrilled now with a keener zest than I had ever enjoyed when we were the defenders of the law instead of its defiers. </span>
<span sid='26365' title='26365'>The high object of our mission, the consciousness that it was unselfish and chivalrous, the villainous character of our opponent, all added to the sporting interest of the adventure. </span>
<span sid='26366' title='26366'>Far from feeling guilty, I rejoiced and exulted in our dangers. </span>
<span sid='26367' title='26367'>With a glow of admiration I watched Holmes unrolling his case of instruments and choosing his tool with the calm, scientific accuracy of a surgeon who performs a delicate operation. </span>
<span sid='26368' title='26368'>I knew that the opening of safes was a particular hobby with him, and I understood the joy which it gave him to be confronted with this green and gold monster, the dragon which held in its maw the reputations of many fair ladies. </span>
<span sid='26369' title='26369'>Turning up the cuffs of his dress-coat - he had placed his overcoat on a chair - Holmes laid out two drills, a jemmy, and several skeleton keys. </span>
<span sid='26370' title='26370'>I stood at the centre door with my eyes glancing at each of the others, ready for any emergency; though, indeed, my plans were somewhat vague as to what I should do if we were interrupted. </span>
<span sid='26371' title='26371'>For half an hour Holmes worked with concentrated energy, laying down one tool, picking up another, handling each with the strength and delicacy of the trained mechanic. </span>
<span sid='26372' title='26372'>Finally I heard a click, the broad green door swung open, and inside I had a glimpse of a number of paper packets, each tied, sealed, and inscribed. </span>
<span sid='26373' title='26373'>Holmes picked one out, but it was hard to read by the flickering fire, and he drew out his little dark lantern, for it was too dangerous, with Milverton in the next room, to switch on the electric light. </span>
<span sid='26374' title='26374'>Suddenly I saw him halt, listen intently, and then in an instant he had swung the door of the safe to, picked up his coat, stuffed his tools into the pockets, and darted behind the window curtain, motioning me to do the same.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26375' title='26375'>It was only when I had joined him there that I heard what had alarmed his quicker senses. </span>
<span sid='26376' title='26376'>There was a noise somewhere within the house. </span>
<span sid='26377' title='26377'>A door slammed in the distance. </span>
<span sid='26378' title='26378'>Then a confused, dull murmur broke itself into the measured thud of heavy footsteps rapidly approaching. </span>
<span sid='26379' title='26379'>They were in the passage outside the room. </span>
<span sid='26380' title='26380'>They paused at the door. </span>
<span sid='26381' title='26381'>The door opened. </span>
<span sid='26382' title='26382'>There was a sharp snick as the electric light was turned on. </span>
<span sid='26383' title='26383'>The door closed once more, and the pungent reek of a strong cigar was borne to our nostrils. </span>
<span sid='26384' title='26384'>Then the footsteps continued backwards and forwards, backwards and forwards, within a few yards of us. </span>
<span sid='26385' title='26385'>Finally, there was a creak from a chair, and the footsteps ceased. </span>
<span sid='26386' title='26386'>Then a key clicked in a lock, and I heard the rustle of papers.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26387' title='26387'>So far I had not dared to look out, but now I gently parted the division of the curtains in front of me and peeped through. </span>
<span sid='26388' title='26388'>From the pressure of Holmes's shoulder against mine I knew that he was sharing my observations. </span>
<span sid='26389' title='26389'>Right in front of us, and almost within our reach, was the broad, rounded back of Milverton. </span>
<span sid='26390' title='26390'>It was evident that we had entirely miscalculated his movements, that he had never been to his bedroom, but that he had been sitting up in some smoking- or billiard room in the farther wing of the house, the windows of which we had not seen. </span>
<span sid='26391' title='26391'>His broad, grizzled head, with its shining patch of baldness, was in the immediate foreground of our vision. </span>
<span sid='26392' title='26392'>He was leaning far back in the red leather chair, his legs outstretched, a long black cigar projecting at an angle from his mouth. </span>
<span sid='26393' title='26393'>He wore a semi-military smoking-jacket, claret-coloured, with a black velvet collar. </span>
<span sid='26394' title='26394'>In his hand he held a long legal document, which he was reading in an indolent fashion, blowing rings of tobacco smoke from his lips as he did so. </span>
<span sid='26395' title='26395'>There was no promise of a speedy departure in his composed bearing and his comfortable attitude.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26396' title='26396'>I felt Holmes's hand steal into mine and give me a reassuring shake, as if to say that the situation was within his powers, and that he was easy in his mind. </span>
<span sid='26397' title='26397'>I was not sure whether he had seen what was only too obvious from my position - that the door of the safe was imperfectly closed, and that Milverton might at any moment observe it. </span>
<span sid='26398' title='26398'>In my own mind I had determined that if I were sure, from the rigidity of his gaze, that it had caught his eye, I would at once spring out, throw my great-coat over his head, pinion him, and leave the rest to Holmes. </span>
<span sid='26399' title='26399'>But Milverton never looked up. </span>
<span sid='26400' title='26400'>He was languidly interested by the papers in his hand, and page after page was turned as he followed the argument of the lawyer. </span>
<span sid='26401' title='26401'>At least, I thought, when he has finished the document and the cigar he will go to his room; but before he had reached the end of either there came a remarkable development which turned our thoughts into quite another channel.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26402' title='26402'>Several times I had observed that Milverton looked at his watch, and once he had risen and sat down again, with a gesture of impatience. </span>
<span sid='26403' title='26403'>The idea, however, that he might have an appointment at so strange an hour never occurred to me until a faint sound reached my ears from the veranda outside. </span>
<span sid='26404' title='26404'>Milverton dropped his papers and sat rigid in his chair. </span>
<span sid='26405' title='26405'>The sound was repeated, and then there came a gentle tap at the door. </span>
<span sid='26406' title='26406'>Milverton rose and opened it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26407' title='26407'>'Well,' said he curtly, 'you are nearly half an hour late.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26408' title='26408'>So this was the explanation of the unlocked door and of the nocturnal vigil of Milverton. </span>
<span sid='26409' title='26409'>There was the gentle rustle of a woman's dress. </span>
<span sid='26410' title='26410'>I had closed the slit between the curtains as Milverton's face turned in our direction, but now I ventured very carefully to open it once more. </span>
<span sid='26411' title='26411'>He had resumed his seat, the cigar still projecting at an insolent angle from the corner of his mouth. </span>
<span sid='26412' title='26412'>In front of him, in the full glare of the electric light, there stood a tall, slim, dark woman, a veil over her face, a mantle drawn round her chin. </span>
<span sid='26413' title='26413'>Her breath came quick and fast and every inch of the lithe figure was quivering with strong emotion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26414' title='26414'>'Well,' said Milverton, 'you've made me lose a good night's rest, my dear. </span>
<span sid='26415' title='26415'>I hope you'll prove worth it. </span>
<span sid='26416' title='26416'>You couldn't come any other time - eh?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26417' title='26417'>The woman shook her head.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26418' title='26418'>'Well, if you couldn't you couldn't. </span>
<span sid='26419' title='26419'>If the Countess is a hard mistress you have your chance to get level with her now. </span>
<span sid='26420' title='26420'>Bless the girl, what are you shivering about? </span>
<span sid='26421' title='26421'>That's right! </span>
<span sid='26422' title='26422'>Pull yourself together! </span>
<span sid='26423' title='26423'>Now, let us get down to business.' </span>
<span sid='26424' title='26424'>He took a note from the drawer of his desk. </span>
<span sid='26425' title='26425'>'You say that you have five letters which compromise the Countess d'Albert. </span>
<span sid='26426' title='26426'>You want to sell them. </span>
<span sid='26427' title='26427'>I want to buy them. </span>
<span sid='26428' title='26428'>So far so good. </span>
<span sid='26429' title='26429'>It only remains to fix a price. </span>
<span sid='26430' title='26430'>I should want to inspect the letters, of course. </span>
<span sid='26431' title='26431'>If they are really good specimens - Good God, is it you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26432' title='26432'>The woman without a word had raised her veil and dropped the mantle from her chin. </span>
<span sid='26433' title='26433'>It was a dark, handsome, clear-cut face which confronted Milverton, a face with a curved nose, strong, dark eyebrows, shading hard, glittering eyes, and a straight, thin-lipped mouth set in a dangerous smile.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26434' title='26434'>'It is I,' she said - 'the woman whose life you have ruined.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26435' title='26435'>Milverton laughed, but fear vibrated in his voice. </span>
<span sid='26436' title='26436'>'You were so very obstinate,' said he. </span>
<span sid='26437' title='26437'>'Why did you drive me to such extremities? </span>
<span sid='26438' title='26438'>I assure you I wouldn't hurt a fly of my own accord, but every man has his business, and what was I to do? </span>
<span sid='26439' title='26439'>I put the price well within your means. </span>
<span sid='26440' title='26440'>You would not pay.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26441' title='26441'>'So you sent the letters to my husband, and he - the noblest gentleman that ever lived, a man whose boots I was never worthy to lace - he broke his gallant heart and died. </span>
<span sid='26442' title='26442'>You remember that last night when I came through that door I begged and prayed you for mercy, and you laughed in my face as you are trying to laugh now, only your coward heart cannot keep your lips from twitching? </span>
<span sid='26443' title='26443'>Yes; you never thought to see me here again, but it was that night which taught me how I could meet you face to face, and alone. </span>
<span sid='26444' title='26444'>Well, Charles Milverton, what have you to say?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26445' title='26445'>'Don't imagine that you can bully me,' said he, rising to his feet. </span>
<span sid='26446' title='26446'>'I have only to raise my voice, and I could call my servants and have you arrested. </span>
<span sid='26447' title='26447'>But I will make allowance for your natural anger. </span>
<span sid='26448' title='26448'>Leave the room at once as you came, and I will say no more.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26449' title='26449'>The woman stood with her hand buried in her bosom, and the same deadly smile on her thin lips.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26450' title='26450'>'You will ruin no more lives as you ruined mine. </span>
<span sid='26451' title='26451'>You will wring no more hearts as you wrung mine. </span>
<span sid='26452' title='26452'>I will free the world of a poisonous thing. </span>
<span sid='26453' title='26453'>Take that, you hound, and that! - and that! - and that! - and that!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26454' title='26454'>She had drawn a little gleaming revolver, and emptied barrel after barrel into Milverton's body, the muzzle within two feet of his shirt front. </span>
<span sid='26455' title='26455'>He shrank away, and then fell forward upon the table, coughing furiously and clawing among the papers. </span>
<span sid='26456' title='26456'>Then he staggered to his feet, received another shot, and rolled upon the floor. </span>
<span sid='26457' title='26457'>'You've done me,' he cried, and lay still. </span>
<span sid='26458' title='26458'>The woman looked at him intently and ground her heel into his upturned face. </span>
<span sid='26459' title='26459'>She looked again, but there was no sound or movement. </span>
<span sid='26460' title='26460'>I heard a sharp rustle, the night air blew into the heated room, and the avenger was gone.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26461' title='26461'>No interference upon our part could have saved the man from his fate; but as the woman poured bullet after bullet into Milverton's shrinking body, I was about to spring out, when I felt Holmes's cold, strong grasp upon my wrist. </span>
<span sid='26462' title='26462'>I understood the whole argument of that firm, restraining grip - that it was no affair of ours; that justice had overtaken a villain; that we had our own duties and our own objects which were not to be lost sight of. </span>
<span sid='26463' title='26463'>But hardly had the woman rushed from the room when Holmes, with swift, silent steps, was over at the other door. </span>
<span sid='26464' title='26464'>He turned the key in the lock. </span>
<span sid='26465' title='26465'>At the same instant we heard voices in the house and the sound of hurrying feet. </span>
<span sid='26466' title='26466'>The revolver shots had roused the household. </span>
<span sid='26467' title='26467'>With perfect coolness Holmes slipped across to the safe, filled his two arms with bundles of letters, and poured them all into the fire. </span>
<span sid='26468' title='26468'>Again and again he did it, until the safe was empty. </span>
<span sid='26469' title='26469'>Someone turned the handle and beat upon the outside of the door. </span>
<span sid='26470' title='26470'>Holmes looked swiftly round. </span>
<span sid='26471' title='26471'>The letter which had been the messenger of death for Milverton lay, all mottled with his blood, upon the table. </span>
<span sid='26472' title='26472'>Holmes tossed it in among the blazing papers. </span>
<span sid='26473' title='26473'>Then he drew the key from the outer door, passed through after me, and locked it on the outside. </span>
<span sid='26474' title='26474'>'This way, Watson,' said he; 'we can scale the garden wall in this direction.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26475' title='26475'>I could not have believed that an alarm could have spread so swiftly. </span>
<span sid='26476' title='26476'>Looking back, the huge house was one blaze of light. </span>
<span sid='26477' title='26477'>The front door was open, and figures were rushing down the drive. </span>
<span sid='26478' title='26478'>The whole garden was alive with people, and one fellow raised a view-halloo as we emerged from the veranda and followed hard at our heels. </span>
<span sid='26479' title='26479'>Holmes seemed to know the ground perfectly, and he threaded his way swiftly among a plantation of small trees, I close at his heels, and our foremost pursuer panting behind us. </span>
<span sid='26480' title='26480'>It was a six-foot wall which barred our path, but he sprang to the top and over. </span>
<span sid='26481' title='26481'>As I did the same I felt the hand of the man behind me grab my ankle; but I kicked myself free, and scrambled over a glass-strewn coping. </span>
<span sid='26482' title='26482'>I fell upon my face among some bushes; but Holmes had me on my feet in an instant, and together we dashed away across the huge expanse of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Hampstead&t=h'>Hampstead</a> Heath. </span>
<span sid='26483' title='26483'>We had run two miles, I suppose, before Holmes at last halted and listened intently. </span>
<span sid='26484' title='26484'>All was absolutely silence behind us. </span>
<span sid='26485' title='26485'>We had shaken off our pursuers, and were safe.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26486' title='26486'>We had breakfasted and were smoking our morning pipe, on the day after the remarkable experience which I have recorded, when Mr Lestrade, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>, very solemn and impressive, was ushered into our modest sitting-room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26487' title='26487'>'Good morning, Mr Holmes,' said he - 'good morning. </span>
<span sid='26488' title='26488'>May I ask if you are very busy just now?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26489' title='26489'>'Not too busy to listen to you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26490' title='26490'>'I thought that, perhaps, if you had nothing particular on hand, you might care to assist us in a most remarkable case which occurred only last night at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Hampstead&t=h'>Hampstead</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26491' title='26491'>'Dear me!' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='26492' title='26492'>'What was that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26493' title='26493'>'A murder - a most dramatic and remarkable murder. </span>
<span sid='26494' title='26494'>I know how keen you are upon these things, and I would take it as a great favour if you would step down to Appledore Towers and give us the benefit of your advice. </span>
<span sid='26495' title='26495'>It is no ordinary crime. </span>
<span sid='26496' title='26496'>We have had our eyes upon this Mr Milverton for some time, and, between ourselves, he was a bit of a villain. </span>
<span sid='26497' title='26497'>He is known to have held papers which he used for blackmailing purposes. </span>
<span sid='26498' title='26498'>These papers have all been burned by the murderers. </span>
<span sid='26499' title='26499'>No article of value was taken, as it is probable that the criminals were men of good position, whose sole object was to prevent social exposure.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26500' title='26500'>'Criminals!' exclaimed Holmes. </span>
<span sid='26501' title='26501'>'Plural!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26502' title='26502'>'Yes, there were two of them. </span>
<span sid='26503' title='26503'>They were, as nearly as possible, captured red-handed. </span>
<span sid='26504' title='26504'>We have their footmarks, we have their description; it's ten to one that we trace them. </span>
<span sid='26505' title='26505'>The first fellow was a bit too active, but the second was caught by the under-gardener, and only got away after a struggle. </span>
<span sid='26506' title='26506'>He was a middle-sized, strongly built man - square jaw, thick neck, moustache, a mask over his eyes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26507' title='26507'>'That's rather vague,' said Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='26508' title='26508'>'Why, it might be a description of Watson!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26509' title='26509'>'It's true,' said the inspector, with much amusement. </span>
<span sid='26510' title='26510'>'It might be a description of Watson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26511' title='26511'>'Well, I am afraid I can't help you, Lestrade,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='26512' title='26512'>'The fact is that I knew this fellow Milverton, that I considered him one of the most dangerous men in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, and that I think there are certain crimes which the law cannot touch, and which therefore, to some extent, justify private revenge. </span>
<span sid='26513' title='26513'>No, it's no use arguing. </span>
<span sid='26514' title='26514'>I have made up my mind. </span>
<span sid='26515' title='26515'>My sympathies are with the criminals rather than with the victim, and I will not handle this case.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26516' title='26516'>Holmes had not said one word to me about the tragedy which we had witnessed, but I observed all the morning that he was in the most thoughtful mood, and he gave me the impression, from his vacant eyes and his abstracted manner, of a man who is striving to recall something to his memory. </span>
<span sid='26517' title='26517'>We were in the middle of our lunch, when he suddenly sprang to his feet. </span>
<span sid='26518' title='26518'>'By Jove, Watson! </span>
<span sid='26519' title='26519'>I've got it!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='26520' title='26520'>'Take your hat! </span>
<span sid='26521' title='26521'>Come with me!' </span>
<span sid='26522' title='26522'>He hurried at his top speed down <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> and along <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Oxford Street&t=h'>Oxford Street</a>, until we had almost reached Regent Circus. </span>
<span sid='26523' title='26523'>Here on the left hand there stands a shop window filled with photographs of the celebrities and beauties of the day. </span>
<span sid='26524' title='26524'>Holmes's eyes fixed themselves upon one of them, and following his gaze I saw the picture of a regal and stately lady in Court dress, with a high diamond tiara upon her noble head. </span>
<span sid='26525' title='26525'>I looked at that delicately curved nose, at the marked eyebrows, at the straight mouth, and the strong little chin beneath it. </span>
<span sid='26526' title='26526'>Then I caught my breath as I read the time-honoured title of the great nobleman and statesman whose wife she had been. </span>
<span sid='26527' title='26527'>My eyes met those of Holmes, and he put his finger to his lips as we turned away from the window.</span>
