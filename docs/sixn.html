<h1><span sid='30026' title='30026'>The Adventure of the Six Napoleons</span></h1>
<p class="subtitle">Arthur Conan Doyle<label for="sn-meta-sixn" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-meta-sixn" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><!--googleoff: all--><b>Story Number</b>: 35<br><b>Published in</b>: The Collier's magazine in 30 April 1904 (US)<br><b>Collected in</b>: The Return of Sherlock Holmes<!--googleon: all--></span></p>
<p>
<span sid='30027' title='30027'>It was no very unusual thing for Mr Lestrade, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>, to look in upon us of an evening, and his visits were welcome to Sherlock Holmes, for they enabled him to keep in touch with all that was going on at the police headquarters. </span>
<span sid='30028' title='30028'>In return for the news which Lestrade would bring, Holmes was always ready to listen with attention to the details of any case upon which the detective was engaged, and was able occasionally, without any active interference, to give some hint or suggestion drawn from his own vast knowledge and experience.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30029' title='30029'>On this particular evening Lestrade had spoken of the weather and the newspapers. </span>
<span sid='30030' title='30030'>Then he had fallen silent, puffing thoughtfully at his cigar. </span>
<span sid='30031' title='30031'>Holmes looked keenly at him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30032' title='30032'>'Anything remarkable on hand?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30033' title='30033'>'Oh, no, Mr Holmes, nothing very particular.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30034' title='30034'>'Then tell me all about it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30035' title='30035'>Lestrade laughed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30036' title='30036'>'Well, Mr Holmes, there is no use denying that there is something on my mind. </span>
<span sid='30037' title='30037'>And yet it is such an absurd business that I hesitated to bother you about it. </span>
<span sid='30038' title='30038'>On the other hand, although it is trivial, it is undoubtedly queer, and I know that you have a taste for all that is out of the common. </span>
<span sid='30039' title='30039'>But in my opinion it comes more in Dr Watson's line that ours.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30040' title='30040'>'Disease?' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30041' title='30041'>'Madness, anyhow. </span>
<span sid='30042' title='30042'>And a queer madness too! </span>
<span sid='30043' title='30043'>You wouldn't think there was anyone living at this time of day who had such a hatred of Napoleon the First that he would break any image of him that he could see.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30044' title='30044'>Holmes sank back in his chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30045' title='30045'>'That's no business of mine,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30046' title='30046'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='30047' title='30047'>That's what I said. </span>
<span sid='30048' title='30048'>But then, when the man commits burglary in order to break images which are not his own, that brings it away from the doctor and on to the policeman.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30049' title='30049'>Holmes sat up again.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30050' title='30050'>'Burglary! </span>
<span sid='30051' title='30051'>This is more interesting. </span>
<span sid='30052' title='30052'>Let me hear the details.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30053' title='30053'>Lestrade took out his official note-book and refreshed his memory from its pages.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30054' title='30054'>'The first case reported was four days ago,' said he. </span>
<span sid='30055' title='30055'>'It was at the shop of Morse Hudson, who has a place for the sale of pictures and statues in the Kennington Road. </span>
<span sid='30056' title='30056'>The assistant had left the front shop for an instant, when he heard a crash, and, hurrying in found a plaster bust of Napoleon, which stood with several other works of art upon the counter, lying shivered into fragments. </span>
<span sid='30057' title='30057'>He rushed out into the road, but, although several passers-by declared that they had noticed a man run out of the shop, he could neither see anyone nor could he find any means of identifying the rascal. </span>
<span sid='30058' title='30058'>It seemed to be one of those senseless acts of hooliganism which occur from time to time, and it was reported to the constable on the beat as such. </span>
<span sid='30059' title='30059'>The plaster cast was not worth more than a few shillings, and the whole affair appeared to be too childish for any particular investigation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30060' title='30060'>'The second case, however, was more serious and also more singular. </span>
<span sid='30061' title='30061'>It occurred only last night.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30062' title='30062'>'In Kennington Road, and within a few hundred yards of Morse Hudson's shop, there lives a well-known medical practitioner, named Dr Barnicot, who has one of the largest practices upon the south side of the Thames. </span>
<span sid='30063' title='30063'>His residence and principal consulting-room is at Kennington Road, but he has a branch surgery and dispensary at Lower <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a> Road, two miles away. </span>
<span sid='30064' title='30064'>This Dr Barnicot is an enthusiastic admirer of Napoleon, and his house is full of books, pictures, and relics of the French Emperor. </span>
<span sid='30065' title='30065'>Some little time ago he purchased from Morse Hudson two duplicate plaster casts of the famous head of Napoleon by the French sculptor Devine. </span>
<span sid='30066' title='30066'>One of these he placed in his hall in the house at Kennington Road, and the other on the mantelpiece of the surgery at Lower <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a>. </span>
<span sid='30067' title='30067'>Well, when Dr Barnicot came down this morning he was astonished to find that his house had been burgled during the night, but that nothing had been taken save the plaster head from the hall. </span>
<span sid='30068' title='30068'>It had been carried out, and had been dashed savagely against the garden wall, under which its splintered fragments were discovered.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30069' title='30069'>Holmes rubbed his hands.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30070' title='30070'>'This is certainly very novel,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30071' title='30071'>'I thought it would please you. </span>
<span sid='30072' title='30072'>But I have not got to the end yet. </span>
<span sid='30073' title='30073'>Dr Barnicot was due at his surgery at twelve o'clock, and you can imagine his amazement when, on arriving there, he found that the window had been opened in the night, and that the broken pieces of his second bust were strewn all over the room. </span>
<span sid='30074' title='30074'>It had been smashed to atoms where it stood. </span>
<span sid='30075' title='30075'>In neither case were there any signs which could give us a clue as to the criminal or lunatic who had done the mischief. </span>
<span sid='30076' title='30076'>Now, Mr Holmes, you have got the facts.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30077' title='30077'>'They are singular, not to say grotesque,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='30078' title='30078'>'May I ask whether the two busts smashed in Dr Barnicot's rooms were the exact duplicates of the one which was destroyed in Morse Hudson's shop?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30079' title='30079'>'They were taken from the same mould.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30080' title='30080'>'Such a fact must tell against the theory that the man who breaks them is influenced by any general hatred of Napoleon. </span>
<span sid='30081' title='30081'>Considering how many hundreds of statues of the great Emperor must exist in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, it is too much to suppose such a coincidence as that a promiscuous iconoclast should chance to begin upon three specimens of the same bust.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30082' title='30082'>'Well, I thought as you do,' said Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='30083' title='30083'>'On the other hand, this Morse Hudson is the purveyor of busts in that part of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, and these three were the only ones which had been in his shop for years. </span>
<span sid='30084' title='30084'>So although, as you say, there are many hundreds of statues in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, it is very probable that these three were the only ones in that district. </span>
<span sid='30085' title='30085'>Therefore a local fanatic would begin with them. </span>
<span sid='30086' title='30086'>What do you think, Dr Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30087' title='30087'>'There are no limits to the possibilities of monomania,' I answered. </span>
<span sid='30088' title='30088'>'There is the condition which the modern French psychologists have called the "idée fixe", which may be trifling in character, and accompanied by complete sanity in every other way. </span>
<span sid='30089' title='30089'>A man who had read deeply about Napoleon, or who had possibly received some hereditary family injury through the great war, might conceivably form such an "idée fixe", and under its influence be capable of any fantastic outrage.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30090' title='30090'>'That won't do, my dear Watson,' said Holmes, shaking his head; 'for no amount of "idée fixe" would enable your interesting monomaniac to find out where these busts were situated.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30091' title='30091'>'Well, how you do you explain it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30092' title='30092'>'I don't attempt to do so. </span>
<span sid='30093' title='30093'>I would only observe that there is a certain method in the gentleman's eccentric proceedings. </span>
<span sid='30094' title='30094'>For example, in Dr Barnicot's hall, where a sound might arouse the family, the bust was taken outside before being broken, whereas in the surgery, where there was less danger of an alarm, it was smashed where it stood. </span>
<span sid='30095' title='30095'>The affair seems absurdly trifling, and yet I dare call nothing trivial when I reflect that some of my most classic cases have had the least promising commencement. </span>
<span sid='30096' title='30096'>You will remember, Watson, how the dreadful business of the Abernetty family was first brought to my notice by the depth which the parsley had sunk into the butter upon a hot day. </span>
<span sid='30097' title='30097'>I can't afford, therefore, to smile at your three broken busts, Lestrade, and I shall be very much obliged to you if you will let me hear of any fresh developments of so singular a chain of events.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30098' title='30098'>The development for which my friend had asked came in a quicker and an infinitely more tragic form than he could have imagined. </span>
<span sid='30099' title='30099'>I was still dressing in my bedroom next morning, when there was a tap at the door, and Holmes entered, a telegram in his hand. </span>
<span sid='30100' title='30100'>He read it aloud:</span>
<p>
<span sid='30101' title='30101'>Come instantly, 131, Pitt Street, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kensington&t=h'>Kensington</a>. </span>
<span sid='30102' title='30102'>LESTRADE.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30103' title='30103'>'What is it, then?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30104' title='30104'>'Don't know - may be anything. </span>
<span sid='30105' title='30105'>But I suspect it is the sequel of the story of the statues. </span>
<span sid='30106' title='30106'>In that case our friend the image-breaker has begun operations in another quarter of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='30107' title='30107'>There's coffee on the table, Watson, and I have a cab at the door.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30108' title='30108'>In half an hour we had reached Pitt Street, a quiet little backwater just beside one of the briskest currents of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> life. </span>
<span sid='30109' title='30109'>No. 131 was one of a row, all flat-chested, respectable, and most unromantic dwellings. </span>
<span sid='30110' title='30110'>As we drove up we found the railings in front of the house lined by a curious crowd. </span>
<span sid='30111' title='30111'>Holmes whistled.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30112' title='30112'>'By George! it's attempted murder at the least. </span>
<span sid='30113' title='30113'>Nothing less will hold the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> message boy. </span>
<span sid='30114' title='30114'>There's a deed of violence indicated in that fellow's round shoulders and outstretched neck. </span>
<span sid='30115' title='30115'>What's this, Watson? </span>
<span sid='30116' title='30116'>The top step swilled down and the other ones dry. </span>
<span sid='30117' title='30117'>Footsteps enough, anyhow! </span>
<span sid='30118' title='30118'>Well, well, there's Lestrade at the front window, and we shall soon know all about it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30119' title='30119'>The official received us with a very grave face and showed us into a sitting-room, where an exceedingly unkempt and agitated elderly man, clad in a flannel dressing-gown, was pacing up and down. </span>
<span sid='30120' title='30120'>He was introduced to us as the owner of the house - Mr Horace Harker, of the Central Press Syndicate.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30121' title='30121'>'It's the Napoleon bust business again,' said Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='30122' title='30122'>'You seemed interested last night, Mr Holmes, so I thought perhaps you would be glad to be present now that the affair has taken a very much graver turn.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30123' title='30123'>'What has it turned to, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30124' title='30124'>'To murder. </span>
<span sid='30125' title='30125'>Mr Harker, will you tell these gentlemen exactly what has occurred?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30126' title='30126'>The man in the dressing-gown turned upon us with a most melancholy face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30127' title='30127'>'It's an extraordinary thing,' said he, 'that all my life I have been collecting other people's news, and now that a real piece of news has come my own way I am so confused and bothered that I can't put two words together. </span>
<span sid='30128' title='30128'>If I had come in here as a journalist I should have interviewed myself and had two columns in every evening paper. </span>
<span sid='30129' title='30129'>As it is, I am giving away valuable copy by telling my story over and over to a string of different people, and I can make no use of it myself. </span>
<span sid='30130' title='30130'>However, I've heard your name, Mr Sherlock Holmes, and if you'll only explain this queer business I shall be paid for my trouble in telling you the story.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30131' title='30131'>Holmes sat down and listened.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30132' title='30132'>'It all seems to centre round that bust of Napoleon which I bought for this very room about four months ago. </span>
<span sid='30133' title='30133'>I picked it up cheap from Harding Brothers, two doors from the High Street Station. </span>
<span sid='30134' title='30134'>A great deal of my journalistic work is done at night, and I often write until the early morning. </span>
<span sid='30135' title='30135'>So it was to-day. </span>
<span sid='30136' title='30136'>I was sitting in my den, which is at the back of the top of the house, about three o'clock, when I was convinced that I heard some sounds downstairs. </span>
<span sid='30137' title='30137'>I listened, but they were not repeated, and I concluded that they came from outside. </span>
<span sid='30138' title='30138'>Then suddenly, about five minutes later, there came a most horrible yell - the most dreadful sound, Mr Holmes, that ever I heard. </span>
<span sid='30139' title='30139'>It will ring in my ears as long as I live. </span>
<span sid='30140' title='30140'>I sat frozen with horror for a minute or two. </span>
<span sid='30141' title='30141'>Then I seized the poker and went downstairs When I entered this room I found the window wide open, and I at once observed that the bust was gone from the mantelpiece. </span>
<span sid='30142' title='30142'>Why any burglar should take such a thing passes my understanding, for it was only a plaster cast, and of no real value whatever.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30143' title='30143'>'You can see for yourself that anyone going out through that open window could reach the front doorstep by taking a long stride. </span>
<span sid='30144' title='30144'>This was clearly what the burglar had done, so I went round and opened the door. </span>
<span sid='30145' title='30145'>Stepping out into the dark I nearly fell over a dead man who was lying there. </span>
<span sid='30146' title='30146'>I ran back for a light, and there was the poor devil, a great gash in his throat and the whole place swimming in blood. </span>
<span sid='30147' title='30147'>He lay on his back, his knees drawn up, and his mouth horribly open. </span>
<span sid='30148' title='30148'>I shall see him in my dreams. </span>
<span sid='30149' title='30149'>I had just time to blow on my police-whistle, and then I must have fainted, for I knew nothing more until I found the policeman standing over me in the hall.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30150' title='30150'>'Well, who was the murdered man?' asked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30151' title='30151'>'There's nothing to show who he was,' said Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='30152' title='30152'>'You shall see the body at the mortuary, but we have made nothing of it up to now. </span>
<span sid='30153' title='30153'>He is a tall man, sunburnt, very powerful, not more than thirty. </span>
<span sid='30154' title='30154'>He is poorly dressed, and yet does not appear to be a labourer. </span>
<span sid='30155' title='30155'>A horn-handled clasp-knife was lying in a pool of blood beside him. </span>
<span sid='30156' title='30156'>Whether it was the weapon which did the deed, or whether it belonged to the dead man, I do not know. </span>
<span sid='30157' title='30157'>There was no name on his clothing, and nothing in his pockets save an apple, some string, a shilling map of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, and a photograph. </span>
<span sid='30158' title='30158'>Here it is.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30159' title='30159'>It was evidently taken by a snap-shot from a small camera. </span>
<span sid='30160' title='30160'>It represented an alert, sharp-featured simian man with thick eyebrows, and a very peculiar projection of the lower part of the face like the muzzle of a baboon.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30161' title='30161'>'And what became of the bust?' asked Holmes, after a careful study of this picture.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30162' title='30162'>'We had news of it just before you came. </span>
<span sid='30163' title='30163'>It has been found in the front garden of an empty house in Campden House Road. </span>
<span sid='30164' title='30164'>It was broken into fragments. </span>
<span sid='30165' title='30165'>I am going round now to see it. </span>
<span sid='30166' title='30166'>Will you come?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30167' title='30167'>'Certainly. </span>
<span sid='30168' title='30168'>I must just take one look round.' </span>
<span sid='30169' title='30169'>He examined the carpet and the window. </span>
<span sid='30170' title='30170'>'The fellow had either very long legs or was a most active man,' said he. </span>
<span sid='30171' title='30171'>'With an area beneath, it was no mean feat to reach that window-ledge and open that window. </span>
<span sid='30172' title='30172'>Getting back was comparatively simple. </span>
<span sid='30173' title='30173'>Are you coming with us to see the remains of your bust, Mr Harker?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30174' title='30174'>The disconsolate journalist had seated himself at a writing-table.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30175' title='30175'>'I must try and make something of it,' said he, 'though I have no doubt that the first editions of the evening papers are out already with full details. </span>
<span sid='30176' title='30176'>It's like my luck! </span>
<span sid='30177' title='30177'>You remember when the stand fell at Doncaster? </span>
<span sid='30178' title='30178'>Well, I was the only journalist in the stand, and my journal the only one that had no account of it, for I was too shaken to write it. </span>
<span sid='30179' title='30179'>And now I'll be too late with a murder done on my own doorstep.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30180' title='30180'>As we left the room we heard his pen travelling shrilly over the foolscap.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30181' title='30181'>The spot where the fragments of the bust had been found was only a few hundred yards away. </span>
<span sid='30182' title='30182'>For the first time our eyes rested upon this presentment of the great Emperor, which seemed to raise such frantic and destructive hatred in the mind of the unknown. </span>
<span sid='30183' title='30183'>It lay scattered in splintered shards upon the grass. </span>
<span sid='30184' title='30184'>Holmes picked up several of them and examined them carefully. </span>
<span sid='30185' title='30185'>I was convinced from his intent face and purposeful manner that at last he was upon a clue.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30186' title='30186'>'Well?' asked Lestrade.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30187' title='30187'>Holmes shrugged his shoulders.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30188' title='30188'>'We have a long way to go yet,' said he. </span>
<span sid='30189' title='30189'>'And yet - and yet - well, we have some suggestive facts to act upon. </span>
<span sid='30190' title='30190'>The possession of this trifling bust was worth more in the eyes of this strange criminal than a human life. </span>
<span sid='30191' title='30191'>That is one point. </span>
<span sid='30192' title='30192'>Then there is the singular fact that he did not break it in the house, or immediately outside the house, if to break it was his sole object.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30193' title='30193'>'He was rattled and hustled by meeting this other fellow. </span>
<span sid='30194' title='30194'>He hardly knew what he was doing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30195' title='30195'>'Well, that's likely enough. </span>
<span sid='30196' title='30196'>But I wish to call your attention very particularly to the position of this house in the garden of which the bust was destroyed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30197' title='30197'>Lestrade looked about him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30198' title='30198'>'It was an empty house, and so he knew that he would not be disturbed in the garden.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30199' title='30199'>'Yes, but there is another empty house farther up the street which he must have passed before he came to this one. </span>
<span sid='30200' title='30200'>Why did he not break it there, since it is evident that every yard that he carried it increased the risk of someone meeting him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30201' title='30201'>'I give it up,' said Lestrade.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30202' title='30202'>Holmes pointed to the street-lamp above our heads.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30203' title='30203'>'He could see what he was doing here, and he could not there. </span>
<span sid='30204' title='30204'>That was the reason.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30205' title='30205'>'By Jove! that's true,' said the detective. </span>
<span sid='30206' title='30206'>'Now that I come to think of it, Dr Barnicot's bust was broken not far from his red lamp. </span>
<span sid='30207' title='30207'>Well, Mr Holmes, what are we to do with that fact?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30208' title='30208'>'To remember it - to docket it. </span>
<span sid='30209' title='30209'>We may come on something later which will bear upon it. </span>
<span sid='30210' title='30210'>What steps do you propose to take now, Lestrade?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30211' title='30211'>'The most practical way of getting at it, in my opinion, is to identify the dead man. </span>
<span sid='30212' title='30212'>There should be no difficulty about that. </span>
<span sid='30213' title='30213'>When we have found who he is and who his associates are, we should have a good start in learning what he was doing in Pitt Street last night, and who it was who met him and killed him on the doorstep of Mr Horace Harker. </span>
<span sid='30214' title='30214'>Don't you think so?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30215' title='30215'>'No doubt; and yet it is not quite the way in which I should approach the case.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30216' title='30216'>'What would you do then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30217' title='30217'>'Oh, you must not let me influence you in any way. </span>
<span sid='30218' title='30218'>I suggest that you go on your line and I on mine. </span>
<span sid='30219' title='30219'>We can compare notes afterwards, and each will supplement the other.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30220' title='30220'>'Very good,' said Lestrade.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30221' title='30221'>'If you are going back to Pitt Street you might see Mr Horace Harker. </span>
<span sid='30222' title='30222'>Tell him from me that I have quite made up my mind, and that it is certain that a dangerous homicidal lunatic with Napoleonic delusions was in his house last night. </span>
<span sid='30223' title='30223'>It will be useful for his article.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30224' title='30224'>Lestrade stared.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30225' title='30225'>'You don't seriously believe that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30226' title='30226'>Holmes smiled.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30227' title='30227'>'Don't I? </span>
<span sid='30228' title='30228'>Well, perhaps I don't. </span>
<span sid='30229' title='30229'>But I am sure that it will interest Mr Horace Harker and the subscribers of the Central Press Syndicate. </span>
<span sid='30230' title='30230'>Now, Watson, I think that we shall find that we have a long and rather complex day's work before us. </span>
<span sid='30231' title='30231'>I should be glad, Lestrade, if you could make it convenient to meet us at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> at six o'clock this evening. </span>
<span sid='30232' title='30232'>Until then I should like to keep this photograph found in the dead man's pocket. </span>
<span sid='30233' title='30233'>It is possible that I may have to ask your company and assistance upon a small expedition which will have to be undertaken to-night, if my chain of reasoning should prove to be correct. </span>
<span sid='30234' title='30234'>Until then, good-bye, and good luck!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30235' title='30235'>Sherlock Holmes and I walked together to the High Street, where he stopped at the shop of Harding Brothers, whence the bust had been purchased. </span>
<span sid='30236' title='30236'>A young assistant informed us that Mr Harding would be absent until after noon, and that he was himself a newcomer, who could give us no information. </span>
<span sid='30237' title='30237'>Holmes's face showed his disappointment and annoyance.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30238' title='30238'>'Well, well, we can't expect to have it all our own way, Watson,' he said at last. </span>
<span sid='30239' title='30239'>'We must come back in the afternoon, if Mr Harding will not be here until then. </span>
<span sid='30240' title='30240'>I am, as you have no doubt surmised, endeavouring to trace these busts to their source, in order to find if there is not something peculiar which may account for their remarkable fate. </span>
<span sid='30241' title='30241'>Let us make for Mr Morse Hudson, of the Kennington Road, and see if he can throw any light upon the problem.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30242' title='30242'>A drive of an hour brought us to the picture-dealer's establishment. </span>
<span sid='30243' title='30243'>He was a small, stout man with a red face and a peppery manner.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30244' title='30244'>'Yes, sir. </span>
<span sid='30245' title='30245'>On my very counter, sir,' said he. </span>
<span sid='30246' title='30246'>'What we pay rates and taxes for I don't know, when any ruffian can come in and break one's goods. </span>
<span sid='30247' title='30247'>Yes, sir, it was I who sold Dr Barnicot his two statues. </span>
<span sid='30248' title='30248'>Disgraceful, sir! </span>
<span sid='30249' title='30249'>A Nihilist plot, that's what I make it. </span>
<span sid='30250' title='30250'>No one but an Anarchist would go about breaking statues. </span>
<span sid='30251' title='30251'>Red republicans, that's what I call 'em. </span>
<span sid='30252' title='30252'>Who did I get the statues from? </span>
<span sid='30253' title='30253'>I don't see what that has to do with it. </span>
<span sid='30254' title='30254'>Well, if you really want to know, I got them from Gelder & Co., in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Church Street&t=h'>Church Street</a>, Stepney. </span>
<span sid='30255' title='30255'>They are a well-known house in the trade, and have been this twenty years. </span>
<span sid='30256' title='30256'>How many had I? </span>
<span sid='30257' title='30257'>Three - two and one are three - two of Dr Barnicot's and one smashed in broad daylight on my own counter. </span>
<span sid='30258' title='30258'>Do I know that photograph? </span>
<span sid='30259' title='30259'>No, I don't. </span>
<span sid='30260' title='30260'>Yes, I do though. </span>
<span sid='30261' title='30261'>Why, it's Beppo! </span>
<span sid='30262' title='30262'>He was a kind of Italian piece-work man, who made himself useful in the shop. </span>
<span sid='30263' title='30263'>He could carve a bit, and gild a frame, and do odd jobs. </span>
<span sid='30264' title='30264'>The fellow left me last week, and I've heard nothing of him since. </span>
<span sid='30265' title='30265'>No, I don't know where he came from nor where he went to. </span>
<span sid='30266' title='30266'>I had nothing against him while he was here. </span>
<span sid='30267' title='30267'>He was gone two days before the bust was smashed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30268' title='30268'>'Well, that's all we could reasonably expect to get from Morse Hudson,' said Holmes, as we emerged from the shop. </span>
<span sid='30269' title='30269'>'We have this Beppo as a common factor, both in Kennington and in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kensington&t=h'>Kensington</a>, so that is worth a ten-mile drive. </span>
<span sid='30270' title='30270'>Now, Watson, let us make for Gelder & Co., of Stepney, the source and origin of busts. </span>
<span sid='30271' title='30271'>I shall be surprised if we don't get some help down there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30272' title='30272'>In rapid succession we passed through the fringe of fashionable <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, hotel <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, theatrical <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, literary <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, commercial <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, and, finally, maritime <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, till we came to a riverside city of a hundred thousand souls, where the tenement houses swelter and reek with the outcasts of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>. </span>
<span sid='30273' title='30273'>Here, in a broad thoroughfare, once the abode of wealthy city merchants we found the sculpture works for which we searched. </span>
<span sid='30274' title='30274'>Outside was a considerable yard full of monumental masonry. </span>
<span sid='30275' title='30275'>Inside was a large room in which fifty workers were carving or moulding. </span>
<span sid='30276' title='30276'>The manager, a big blond German, received us civilly, and gave a clear answer to all Holmes's questions. </span>
<span sid='30277' title='30277'>A reference to his books showed that hundreds of casts had been taken from a marble copy of Devine's head of Napoleon, but that the three which had been sent to Morse Hudson a year or so before had been half of a batch of six, the other three being sent to Harding Brothers, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kensington&t=h'>Kensington</a>. </span>
<span sid='30278' title='30278'>There was no reason why those six should be different to any of the other casts. </span>
<span sid='30279' title='30279'>He could suggest no possible cause why anyone should wish to destroy them - in fact, he laughed at the idea. </span>
<span sid='30280' title='30280'>Their wholesale price was six shillings, but the retailer would get twelve or more. </span>
<span sid='30281' title='30281'>The cast was taken in two moulds from each side of the face, and then these two profiles of plaster of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Paris&t=h'>Paris</a> were joined together to make the complete bust. </span>
<span sid='30282' title='30282'>The work was usually done by Italians in the room we were in. </span>
<span sid='30283' title='30283'>When finished the busts were put on a table in the passage to dry, and afterwards stored. </span>
<span sid='30284' title='30284'>That was all he could tell us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30285' title='30285'>But the production of the photograph had a remarkable effect upon the manager. </span>
<span sid='30286' title='30286'>His face flushed with anger, and his brows knotted over his blue Teutonic eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30287' title='30287'>'Ah, the rascal!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='30288' title='30288'>'Yes, indeed, I know him very well. </span>
<span sid='30289' title='30289'>This has always been a respectable establishment, and the only time that we have ever had the police in it was over this very fellow. </span>
<span sid='30290' title='30290'>It was more than a year ago now. </span>
<span sid='30291' title='30291'>He knifed another Italian in the street, and then he came to the works with the police on his heels, and he was taken here. </span>
<span sid='30292' title='30292'>Beppo was his name - his second name I never knew. </span>
<span sid='30293' title='30293'>Serve me right for engaging a man with such a face. </span>
<span sid='30294' title='30294'>But he was a good workman - one of the best.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30295' title='30295'>'What did he get?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30296' title='30296'>'The man lived, and he got off with a year. </span>
<span sid='30297' title='30297'>I have no doubt he is out now; but he has not dared to show his nose here. </span>
<span sid='30298' title='30298'>We have a cousin of his here, and I dare say he could tell you where he is.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30299' title='30299'>'No, no,' cried Holmes, 'not a word to the cousin - not a word, I beg you. </span>
<span sid='30300' title='30300'>The matter is very important, and the farther I go with it the more important it seems to grow. </span>
<span sid='30301' title='30301'>When you referred in your ledger to the sale of those casts I observed that the date was 3rd June of last year. </span>
<span sid='30302' title='30302'>Could you give me the date when Beppo was arrested?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30303' title='30303'>'I could tell you roughly by the pay-list,' the manager answered. </span>
<span sid='30304' title='30304'>'Yes,' he continued, after some turning over of pages, 'he was paid last on May 20th.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30305' title='30305'>'Thank you,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='30306' title='30306'>'I don't think that I need intrude upon your time and patience any more.' </span>
<span sid='30307' title='30307'>With a last word of caution that he should say nothing as to our researches we turned our faces westward once more.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30308' title='30308'>The afternoon was far advanced before we were able to snatch a hasty luncheon at a restaurant. </span>
<span sid='30309' title='30309'>A news-bill at the entrance announced '<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kensington&t=h'>Kensington</a> Outrage. </span>
<span sid='30310' title='30310'>Murder by a Madman', and the contents of the paper showed that Mr Horace Harker had got his account into print after all. </span>
<span sid='30311' title='30311'>Two columns were occupied with a highly sensational and flowery rendering of the whole incident. </span>
<span sid='30312' title='30312'>Holmes propped it against the cruet stand and read it while he ate. </span>
<span sid='30313' title='30313'>Once or twice he chuckled.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30314' title='30314'>'This is all right, Watson,' said he. </span>
<span sid='30315' title='30315'>'Listen to this: "It is satisfactory to know that there can be no difference of opinion upon this case, since Mr Lestrade, one of the most experienced members of the official force, and Mr Sherlock Holmes, the well-known consulting expert, have each come to the conclusion that the grotesque series of incidents, which have ended in so tragic a fashion, arise from lunacy rather than from deliberate crime. </span>
<span sid='30316' title='30316'>No explanation save mental aberration can cover the facts." </span>
<span sid='30317' title='30317'>The Press, Watson, is a most valuable institution, if you only know how to use it. </span>
<span sid='30318' title='30318'>And now, if you have quite finished, we will hark back to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kensington&t=h'>Kensington</a>, and see what the manager of Harding Brothers has to say to the matter?</span>
<p>
<span sid='30319' title='30319'>The founder of that great emporium proved to be a brisk, crisp little person, very dapper and quick, with a clear head and a ready tongue.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30320' title='30320'>'Yes, sir, I have already read the account in the evening papers. </span>
<span sid='30321' title='30321'>Mr Horace Harker is a customer of ours. </span>
<span sid='30322' title='30322'>We supplied him with the bust some months ago. </span>
<span sid='30323' title='30323'>We ordered three busts of that sort from Gelder & Co., of Stepney. </span>
<span sid='30324' title='30324'>They are all sold now. </span>
<span sid='30325' title='30325'>To whom? </span>
<span sid='30326' title='30326'>Oh, I dare say by consulting our sales book we could very easily tell you. </span>
<span sid='30327' title='30327'>Yes, we have the entries here. </span>
<span sid='30328' title='30328'>One to Mr Harker, you see, and one to Mr Josiah Brown, of Laburnum Lodge, Laburnum Vale, Chiswick, and one to Mr Sandeford, of Lower Grove Road, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Reading&t=h'>Reading</a>. </span>
<span sid='30329' title='30329'>No, I have never seen this face which you show me in the photograph. </span>
<span sid='30330' title='30330'>You would hardly forget it - would you, sir? - for I've seldom seen an uglier. </span>
<span sid='30331' title='30331'>Have we any Italians on the staff? </span>
<span sid='30332' title='30332'>Yes, sir, we have several among our work-people and cleaners. </span>
<span sid='30333' title='30333'>I dare say they might get a peep at that sales book if they wanted to. </span>
<span sid='30334' title='30334'>There is no particular reason for keeping a watch upon that book. </span>
<span sid='30335' title='30335'>Well, well, it's a very strange business, and I hope that you'll let me know if anything comes of your inquiries.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30336' title='30336'>Holmes had taken several notes during Mr Harding's evidence, and I could see that he was thoroughly satisfied by the turn which affairs were taking. </span>
<span sid='30337' title='30337'>He made no remark, however, save that, unless we hurried, we should be late for our appointment with Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='30338' title='30338'>Sure enough, when we reached <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> the detective was already there, and we found him pacing up and down in a fever of impatience. </span>
<span sid='30339' title='30339'>His look of importance showed that his day's work had not been in vain.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30340' title='30340'>'Well?' he asked. </span>
<span sid='30341' title='30341'>'What luck, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30342' title='30342'>'We have had a very busy day, and not entirely a wasted one,' my friend explained. </span>
<span sid='30343' title='30343'>'We have seen both the retailers and also the wholesale manufacturers. </span>
<span sid='30344' title='30344'>I can trace each of the busts now from the beginning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30345' title='30345'>'The busts!' cried Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='30346' title='30346'>'Well, well, you have your own methods, Mr Sherlock Holmes, and it is not for me to say a word against them, but I think I have done a better day's work than you. </span>
<span sid='30347' title='30347'>I have identified the dead man.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30348' title='30348'>'You don't say so?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30349' title='30349'>'And found a cause for the crime.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30350' title='30350'>'Splendid!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30351' title='30351'>'We have an inspector who makes a speciality of Saffron Hill and the Italian quarter. </span>
<span sid='30352' title='30352'>Well, this dead man had some Catholic emblem round his neck, and that, along with his colour, made me think he was from the South. </span>
<span sid='30353' title='30353'>Inspector Hill knew him the moment he caught sight of him. </span>
<span sid='30354' title='30354'>His name is Pietro Venucci, from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Naples&t=h'>Naples</a>, and he is one of the greatest cut-throats in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='30355' title='30355'>He is connected with the Mafia, which, as you know, is a secret political society, enforcing its decrees by murder. </span>
<span sid='30356' title='30356'>Now you see how the affair begins to clear up. </span>
<span sid='30357' title='30357'>The other fellow is probably an Italian also, and a member of the Mafia. </span>
<span sid='30358' title='30358'>He has broken the rules in some fashion. </span>
<span sid='30359' title='30359'>Pietro is set upon his track. </span>
<span sid='30360' title='30360'>Probably the photograph we found in his pocket is the man himself, so that he may not knife the wrong person. </span>
<span sid='30361' title='30361'>He dogs the fellow, he sees him enter a house, he waits outside for him, and in the scuffle receives his own death-wound. </span>
<span sid='30362' title='30362'>How is that, Mr Sherlock Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30363' title='30363'>Holmes clapped his hands approvingly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30364' title='30364'>'Excellent, Lestrade, excellent!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='30365' title='30365'>'But I didn't quite follow your explanation of the destruction of the busts.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30366' title='30366'>'The busts! </span>
<span sid='30367' title='30367'>You never can get those busts out of your head. </span>
<span sid='30368' title='30368'>After all, that is nothing; petty larceny, six months at the most. </span>
<span sid='30369' title='30369'>It is the murder that we are really investigating, and I tell you that I am gathering all the threads into my hands.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30370' title='30370'>'And the next stage?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30371' title='30371'>'Is a very simple one. </span>
<span sid='30372' title='30372'>I shall go down with Hill to the Italian quarter, find the man whose photograph we have got, and arrest him on the charge of murder. </span>
<span sid='30373' title='30373'>Will you come with us?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30374' title='30374'>'I think not. </span>
<span sid='30375' title='30375'>I fancy we can attain our end in a simpler way. </span>
<span sid='30376' title='30376'>I can't say for certain, because it all depends - well, it all depends upon a factor which is completely outside our control. </span>
<span sid='30377' title='30377'>But I have great hopes - in fact, the betting is exactly two to one - that if you will come with us tonight I shall be able to help you to lay him by the heels.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30378' title='30378'>'In the Italian quarter?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30379' title='30379'>'No; I fancy Chiswick is an address which is more likely to find him. </span>
<span sid='30380' title='30380'>If you will come with me to Chiswick tonight, Lestrade, I'll promise to go to the Italian quarter with you to-morrow, and no harm will be done by the delay. </span>
<span sid='30381' title='30381'>And now I think that a few hours' sleep would do us all good, for I do not propose to leave before eleven o'clock, and it is unlikely that we shall be back before morning. </span>
<span sid='30382' title='30382'>You'll dine with us, Lestrade, and then you are welcome to the sofa until it is time for us to start. </span>
<span sid='30383' title='30383'>In the meantime, Watson, I should be glad if you would ring for an express messenger, for I have a letter to send, and it is important that it should go at once.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30384' title='30384'>Holmes spent the evening in rummaging among the files of the old daily papers with which one of our lumber-rooms was packed. </span>
<span sid='30385' title='30385'>When at last he descended it was with triumph in his eyes, but he said nothing to either of us as to the result of his researches. </span>
<span sid='30386' title='30386'>For my own part, I had followed step by step the methods by which he had traced the various windings of this complex case, and, though I could not yet perceive the goal which we would reach, I understood clearly that Holmes expected this grotesque criminal to make an attempt upon the two remaining busts, one of which, I remembered, was at Chiswick. </span>
<span sid='30387' title='30387'>No doubt the object of our journey was to catch him in the very act, and I could not but admire the cunning with which my friend had inserted the wrong clue in the evening paper so as to give the fellow the idea that he could continue his scheme with impunity. </span>
<span sid='30388' title='30388'>I was not surprised when Holmes suggested that I should take my revolver with me. </span>
<span sid='30389' title='30389'>He had himself picked up the loaded hunting-crop which was his favourite weapon.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30390' title='30390'>A four-wheeler was at the door at eleven, and in it we drove to a spot at the other side of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Hammersmith&t=h'>Hammersmith</a> Bridge. </span>
<span sid='30391' title='30391'>Here the cabman was directed to wait. </span>
<span sid='30392' title='30392'>A short walk brought us to a secluded road fringed with pleasant houses, each standing in its own grounds. </span>
<span sid='30393' title='30393'>In the light of a street lamp we read 'Laburnum Villa' upon the gate-post of one of them. </span>
<span sid='30394' title='30394'>The occupants had evidently retired to rest, for all was dark save for a fanlight over the hall door, which shed a single blurred circle on to the garden path. </span>
<span sid='30395' title='30395'>The wooden fence which separated the grounds from the road threw a dense black shadow upon the inner side, and here it was that we crouched.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30396' title='30396'>'I fear that you'll have a long time to wait,' Holmes whispered. </span>
<span sid='30397' title='30397'>'We may thank our stars that it is not raining. </span>
<span sid='30398' title='30398'>I don't think we can even venture to smoke to pass the time. </span>
<span sid='30399' title='30399'>However, it's a two to one chance that we get something to pay us for our trouble.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30400' title='30400'>It proved, however, that our vigil was not to be so long as Holmes had led us to fear, and it ended in a very sudden and singular fashion. </span>
<span sid='30401' title='30401'>In an instant, without the least sound to warn us of his coming, the garden gate swung open, and a lithe, dark figure, as swift and active as an ape, rushed up the garden path. </span>
<span sid='30402' title='30402'>We saw it whisk past the light thrown from over the door and disappear against the black shadow of the house. </span>
<span sid='30403' title='30403'>There was a long pause, during which we held our breath, and then a very gentle creaking sound came to our ears. </span>
<span sid='30404' title='30404'>The window was being opened. </span>
<span sid='30405' title='30405'>The noise ceased, and again there was a long silence. </span>
<span sid='30406' title='30406'>The fellow was making his way into the house. </span>
<span sid='30407' title='30407'>We saw the sudden flash of a dark lantern inside the room. </span>
<span sid='30408' title='30408'>What he sought was evidently not there, for again we saw the flash through another blind, and then through another.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30409' title='30409'>'Let us get to the open window. </span>
<span sid='30410' title='30410'>We will nab him as he climbs out,' Lestrade whispered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30411' title='30411'>But before we could move the man had emerged again. </span>
<span sid='30412' title='30412'>As he came out into the glimmering patch of light we saw that he carried something white under his arm. </span>
<span sid='30413' title='30413'>He looked stealthily all round him. </span>
<span sid='30414' title='30414'>The silence of the deserted street reassured him. </span>
<span sid='30415' title='30415'>Turning his back upon us, he laid down his burden, and the next instant there was the sound of a sharp tap, followed by a clatter and rattle. </span>
<span sid='30416' title='30416'>The man was so intent upon what he was doing that he never heard our steps as we stole across the grass plot. </span>
<span sid='30417' title='30417'>With the bound of a tiger Holmes was on his back, and an instant later Lestrade and I had him by either wrist, and the handcuffs had been fastened. </span>
<span sid='30418' title='30418'>As we turned him over I saw his hideous, sallow face, with writhing, furious features glaring up at us, and I knew that it was indeed the man of the photograph whom we had secured.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30419' title='30419'>But it was not our prisoner to whom Holmes was giving his attention. </span>
<span sid='30420' title='30420'>Squatted on the doorstep, he was engaged in most carefully examining that which the man had brought from the house. </span>
<span sid='30421' title='30421'>It was a bust of Napoleon like the one which we had seen that morning, and it had been broken into similar fragments. </span>
<span sid='30422' title='30422'>Carefully Holmes held each separate shard to the light, but in no way did it differ from any other shattered piece of plaster. </span>
<span sid='30423' title='30423'>He had just completed his examination, when the hall lights flew up, the door opened and the owner of the house, a jovial, rotund figure in shirt and trousers, presented himself.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30424' title='30424'>'Mr Josiah Brown, I suppose?' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30425' title='30425'>'Yes, sir; and you no doubt are Mr Sherlock Holmes? </span>
<span sid='30426' title='30426'>I had the note which you sent by the express messenger, and I did exactly what you told me. </span>
<span sid='30427' title='30427'>We locked every door in the inside and awaited developments. </span>
<span sid='30428' title='30428'>Well, I'm very glad to see that you have got the rascal. </span>
<span sid='30429' title='30429'>I hope, gentlemen, that you will come in and have some refreshment.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30430' title='30430'>However, Lestrade was anxious to get his man into safe quarters, so within a few minutes our cab had been summoned and we were all four upon our way to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='30431' title='30431'>Not a word would our captive say; but he glared at us from the shadow of his matted hair, and once, when my hand seemed within his reach, he snapped at it like a hungry wolf. </span>
<span sid='30432' title='30432'>We stayed long enough at the police-station to learn that a search of his clothing revealed nothing save shillings and a long sheath knife, the handle of which bore copious traces of recent blood.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30433' title='30433'>'That's all right,' said Lestrade, as we parted. </span>
<span sid='30434' title='30434'>'Hill knows all these gentry, and he will give a name to him. </span>
<span sid='30435' title='30435'>You'll find that my theory of the Mafia will work out all right. </span>
<span sid='30436' title='30436'>But I'm sure I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mr Holmes, for the workmanlike way in which you laid hands upon him. </span>
<span sid='30437' title='30437'>I don't quite understand it all yet.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30438' title='30438'>'I fear it is rather too late an hour for explanations,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='30439' title='30439'>'Besides, there are one or two details which are not finished off, and it is one of those cases which are worth working out to the very end. </span>
<span sid='30440' title='30440'>If you will come round once more to my rooms at six o'clock to-morrow I think I shall he able to show you that even now you have not grasped the entire meaning of this business, which presents some features which make it absolutely original in the history of crime. </span>
<span sid='30441' title='30441'>If ever I permit you to chronicle any more of my little problems, Watson, I foresee that you will enliven your pages by an account of the singular adventure of the Napoleonic busts.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30442' title='30442'>When we met again next evening, Lestrade was furnished with much information concerning our prisoner. </span>
<span sid='30443' title='30443'>His name, it appeared, was Beppo, second name unknown. </span>
<span sid='30444' title='30444'>He was a well-known ne'er-do-well among the Italian colony. </span>
<span sid='30445' title='30445'>He had once been a skilful sculptor and had earned an honest living, but he had taken to evil courses, and had twice already been in gaol - once for a petty theft and once, as we had already heard, for stabbing a fellow-countryman. </span>
<span sid='30446' title='30446'>He could talk English perfectly well. </span>
<span sid='30447' title='30447'>His reasons for destroying the busts were still unknown, and he refused to answer any questions upon the subject; but the police had discovered that these same busts might very well have been made by his own hands, since he was engaged in this class of work at the establishment of Gelder & Co. </span>
<span sid='30448' title='30448'>To all this information, much of which we already knew, Holmes listened with polite attention; but I, who knew him so well, could clearly see that his thoughts were elsewhere, and I detected a mixture of mingled uneasiness and expectation beneath that mask which he was wont to assume. </span>
<span sid='30449' title='30449'>At last he started in his chair and his eyes brightened. </span>
<span sid='30450' title='30450'>There had been a ring at the bell. </span>
<span sid='30451' title='30451'>A minute later we heard steps upon he stairs, and an elderly, red-faced man with grizzled side-whiskers was ushered in. </span>
<span sid='30452' title='30452'>In his right hand he carried an old-fashioned carpet-bag, which he placed upon the table.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30453' title='30453'>'Is Mr Sherlock Holmes here?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30454' title='30454'>My friend bowed and smiled 'Mr Sandeford, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Reading&t=h'>Reading</a>, I suppose?' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30455' title='30455'>'Yes, sir. </span>
<span sid='30456' title='30456'>I fear that I am a little late; but the trains were awkward. </span>
<span sid='30457' title='30457'>You wrote to me about a bust that is in my possession.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30458' title='30458'>'Exactly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30459' title='30459'>'I have your letter here. </span>
<span sid='30460' title='30460'>You said, "I desire to possess a copy of Devine's Napoleon and am prepared to pay you ten pounds for the one which is in your possession." </span>
<span sid='30461' title='30461'>Is that right?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30462' title='30462'>'Certainly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30463' title='30463'>'I was very much surprised at your letter, for I could not imagine how you knew that I owned such a thing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30464' title='30464'>'Of course you must have been surprised, but the explanation is very simple. </span>
<span sid='30465' title='30465'>Mr Harding, of Harding Brothers, said that they had sold you their last copy, and he gave me your address.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30466' title='30466'>'Oh, that was it, was it? </span>
<span sid='30467' title='30467'>Did he tell you what I paid for it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30468' title='30468'>'No, he did not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30469' title='30469'>'Well, I am an honest man, though not a very rich one. </span>
<span sid='30470' title='30470'>I only gave fifteen shillings for the bust, and I think you ought to know that before I take ten pounds from you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30471' title='30471'>'I am sure the scruple does you honour, Mr Sandeford. </span>
<span sid='30472' title='30472'>But I have named that price, so I intend to stick to it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30473' title='30473'>'Well, it is very handsome of you, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='30474' title='30474'>I brought the bust up with me, as you asked me to do. </span>
<span sid='30475' title='30475'>Here it is!' </span>
<span sid='30476' title='30476'>He opened his bag, and at last we saw placed upon our table a complete specimen of that bust which we had already seen more than once in fragments.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30477' title='30477'>Holmes took a paper from his pocket and laid a ten-pound note upon the table.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30478' title='30478'>'You will kindly sign that paper, Mr Sandeford, in the presence of these witnesses. </span>
<span sid='30479' title='30479'>It is simply to say that you transfer every possible right that you ever had in the bust to me. </span>
<span sid='30480' title='30480'>I am a methodical man, you see, and you never know what turn events might take afterwards. </span>
<span sid='30481' title='30481'>Thank you, Mr Sandeford; here is your money, and I wish you a very good evening.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30482' title='30482'>When our visitor had disappeared Sherlock Holmes's movements were such as to rivet our attention. </span>
<span sid='30483' title='30483'>He began by taking a clean white cloth from a drawer and laying it over the table. </span>
<span sid='30484' title='30484'>Then he placed his newly acquired bust in the centre of the cloth. </span>
<span sid='30485' title='30485'>Finally he picked up his hunting-crop and struck Napoleon a sharp blow on the top of the head. </span>
<span sid='30486' title='30486'>The figure broke into fragments, and Holmes bent eagerly over the shattered remains. </span>
<span sid='30487' title='30487'>Next instant, with a loud shout of triumph, he held up one splinter, in which a round, dark object was fixed like a plum in a pudding.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30488' title='30488'>'Gentlemen,' he cried, let me introduce you to the famous black pearl of the Borgias.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30489' title='30489'>Lestrade and I sat silent for a moment, and then, with a spontaneous impulse, we both broke out clapping as at the well-wrought crisis of a play. </span>
<span sid='30490' title='30490'>A flush of colour sprang to Holmes's pale cheeks, and he bowed to us like the master dramatist who receives the homage of his audience. </span>
<span sid='30491' title='30491'>It was at such moments that for an instant he ceased to be a reasoning machine and betrayed his human love for admiration and applause. </span>
<span sid='30492' title='30492'>The same singularly proud and reserved nature which turned away with disdain from popular notoriety was capable of being moved to its depth by spontaneous wonder and praise from a friend.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30493' title='30493'>'Yes, gentlemen,' said he, 'it is the most famous pearl now existing in the world, and it has been my good fortune, by a connected chain of inductive reasoning, to trace it from the Prince of Colonna's bedroom at the Dacre Hotel, where it was lost, to the interior of this, the last of the six busts of Napoleon which were manufactured by Gelder & Co., of Stepney. </span>
<span sid='30494' title='30494'>You will remember, Lestrade, the sensation caused by the disappearance of this valuable jewel, and the vain efforts of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> police to recover it. </span>
<span sid='30495' title='30495'>I was myself consulted upon the case; but I was unable to throw any light upon it. </span>
<span sid='30496' title='30496'>Suspicion fell upon the maid of the Princess, who was an Italian, and it was proved that she had a brother in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, but we failed to trace any connection between them. </span>
<span sid='30497' title='30497'>The maid's name was Lucretia Venucci, and there is no doubt in my mind that this Pietro who was murdered two nights ago was the brother. </span>
<span sid='30498' title='30498'>I have been looking up the dates in the old files of the paper, and I find that the disappearance of the pearl was exactly two days before the arrest of Beppo for some crime of violence - an event which took place in the factory of Gelder & Co., at the very moment when these busts were being made. </span>
<span sid='30499' title='30499'>Now you clearly see the sequence of events, though you see them, of course, in the inverse order to the way in which they presented themselves to me. </span>
<span sid='30500' title='30500'>Beppo had the pearl in his possession. </span>
<span sid='30501' title='30501'>He may have stolen it from Pietro, he may have been Pietro's confederate, he may have been the go-between of Pietro and his sister. </span>
<span sid='30502' title='30502'>It is of no consequence to us which is the correct solution.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30503' title='30503'>'The main fact is that he had the pearl, and at that moment, when it was on his person, he was pursued by the police. </span>
<span sid='30504' title='30504'>He made for the factory in which he worked, and he knew that he had only a few minutes in which to conceal this enormously valuable prize, which would otherwise be found on him when he was searched. </span>
<span sid='30505' title='30505'>Six plaster casts of Napoleon were drying in the passage. </span>
<span sid='30506' title='30506'>One of them was still soft. </span>
<span sid='30507' title='30507'>In an instant Beppo, a skilful workman, made a small hole in the wet plaster, dropped in the pearl, and with a few touches covered over the aperture once more. </span>
<span sid='30508' title='30508'>It was an admirable hiding-place. </span>
<span sid='30509' title='30509'>No one could possibly find it. </span>
<span sid='30510' title='30510'>But Beppo was condemned to a year's imprisonment, and in the meanwhile his six busts were scattered over <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='30511' title='30511'>He could not tell which contained his treasure. </span>
<span sid='30512' title='30512'>Only by breaking them could he see. </span>
<span sid='30513' title='30513'>Even shaking would tell him nothing for as the plaster was wet it was probable that the pearl would adhere to it - as, in fact, it has done. </span>
<span sid='30514' title='30514'>Beppo did not despair, and he conducted his search with considerable ingenuity and perseverance. </span>
<span sid='30515' title='30515'>Through a cousin who works with Gelder he found out the retail firms who had bought the busts. </span>
<span sid='30516' title='30516'>He managed to find employment with Morse Hudson, and in that way tracked down three of them. </span>
<span sid='30517' title='30517'>The pearl was not there. </span>
<span sid='30518' title='30518'>Then with the help of some Italian employee, he succeeded in finding out where the other three busts had gone. </span>
<span sid='30519' title='30519'>The first was at Harker's. </span>
<span sid='30520' title='30520'>There he was dogged by his confederate, who held Beppo responsible for the loss of the pearl, and he stabbed him in the scuffle which followed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30521' title='30521'>'If he was his confederate, why should he carry his photograph?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30522' title='30522'>'As a means of tracing him if he wished to inquire about him from any third person. </span>
<span sid='30523' title='30523'>That was the obvious reason. </span>
<span sid='30524' title='30524'>Well, after the murder I calculated that Beppo would probably hurry rather than delay his movements. </span>
<span sid='30525' title='30525'>He would fear that the police would read his secret, and so hastened on before they should get ahead of him. </span>
<span sid='30526' title='30526'>Of course, I could not say that he had not found the pearl in Harker's bust. </span>
<span sid='30527' title='30527'>I had not even concluded for certain that it was the pearl; but it was evident to me that he was looking for something, since he carried the bust past the other houses in order to break it in the garden which had a lamp overlooking it. </span>
<span sid='30528' title='30528'>Since Harker's bust was one in three, the chances were exactly as I told you - two to one against the pearl being inside it. </span>
<span sid='30529' title='30529'>There remained two busts, and it was obvious that he would go for the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> one first. </span>
<span sid='30530' title='30530'>I warned the inmates of the house, so as to avoid a second tragedy, and we went down, with the happiest results. </span>
<span sid='30531' title='30531'>By that time, of course, I knew for certain that it was the Borgia pearl that we were after. </span>
<span sid='30532' title='30532'>The name of the murdered man linked the one event with the other. </span>
<span sid='30533' title='30533'>There only remained a single bust - the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Reading&t=h'>Reading</a> one - and the pearl must be there. </span>
<span sid='30534' title='30534'>I bought it in your presence from the owner - and there it lies.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30535' title='30535'>We sat in silence for a moment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='30536' title='30536'>'Well,' said Lestrade, 'I've seen you handle a good many cases, Mr Holmes, but I don't know that I ever knew a more workmanlike one than that. </span>
<span sid='30537' title='30537'>We're not jealous of you at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>. </span>
<span sid='30538' title='30538'>No, sir, we are damned proud of you, and if you come down tomorrow there's not a man, from the oldest inspector to the youngest constable, who wouldn't be glad to shake you by the hand.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='30539' title='30539'>'Thank you!' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='30540' title='30540'>'Thank you!' and as he turned away it seemed to me that he was more nearly moved by the softer human emotions than I had ever seen him. </span>
<span sid='30541' title='30541'>A moment later he was the cold and practical thinker once more. </span>
<span sid='30542' title='30542'>'Put the pearl in the safe, Watson,' said he, 'and get out the papers of the Conk-Singleton forgery case. </span>
<span sid='30543' title='30543'>Goodbye, Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='30544' title='30544'>If any little problem comes your way I shall be happy, if I can, to give you a hint or two as to its solution.'</span>
