<h1><span sid='27200' title='27200'>The Adventure of the Abbey Grange</span></h1>
<p class="subtitle">Arthur Conan Doyle<label for="sn-meta-abbe" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-meta-abbe" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><!--googleoff: all--><b>Story Number</b>: 39<br><b>Published in</b>: The Strand Magazine in September 1904<br><b>Collected in</b>: The Return of Sherlock Holmes<!--googleon: all--></span></p>
<p>
<span sid='27201' title='27201'>It was on a bitterly cold and frosty morning during the winter of '97 that I was wakened by a tugging at my shoulder. </span>
<span sid='27202' title='27202'>It was Holmes. </span>
<span sid='27203' title='27203'>The candle in his hand shone upon his eager, stooping face, and told me at a glance that something was amiss.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27204' title='27204'>'Come, Watson, come!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='27205' title='27205'>'The game is afoot. </span>
<span sid='27206' title='27206'>Not a word! </span>
<span sid='27207' title='27207'>Into your clothes and come!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27208' title='27208'>Ten minutes later we were both in a cab and rattling through the silent streets on our way to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Charing Cross&t=h'>Charing Cross</a> Station. </span>
<span sid='27209' title='27209'>The first faint winter's dawn was beginning to appear, and we could dimly see the occasional figure of an early workman as he passed us, blurred and indistinct in the opalescent <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> reek. </span>
<span sid='27210' title='27210'>Holmes nestled in silence into his heavy coat, and I was glad to do the same, for the air was most bitter, and neither of us had broken our fast. </span>
<span sid='27211' title='27211'>It was not until we had consumed some hot tea at the station, and taken our places in the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kent&t=h'>Kent</a>ish train, that we were sufficiently thawed, he to speak and I to listen. </span>
<span sid='27212' title='27212'>Holmes drew a note from his pocket and read it aloud:</span>
<p>
<span sid='27213' title='27213'>ABBEY GRANGE, MARSHAM, KENT, 3.30 am</span>
<p>
<span sid='27214' title='27214'>My dear Mr Holmes - I should be very glad of your immediate assistance in what promises to be a most remarkable case. </span>
<span sid='27215' title='27215'>It is something quite in your line. </span>
<span sid='27216' title='27216'>Except for releasing the lady I will see that everything is kept exactly as I have found it, but I beg you not to lose an instant, as it is difficult to leave Sir Eustace there.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27217' title='27217'>Yours faithfully,</span>
<p>
<span sid='27218' title='27218'>STANLEY HOPKINS.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27219' title='27219'>'Hopkins has called me in seven times, and on each occasion his summons has been entirely justified,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='27220' title='27220'>'I fancy that every one of his cases has found its way into your collection, and I must admit, Watson, that you have some power of selection which atones for much which I deplore in your narratives. </span>
<span sid='27221' title='27221'>Your fatal habit of looking at everything from the point of view of a story instead of as a scientific exercise has ruined what might have been an instructive and even classical series of demonstrations. </span>
<span sid='27222' title='27222'>You slur over work of the utmost finesse and delicacy in order to dwell upon sensational details which may excite but cannot possibly instruct the reader.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27223' title='27223'>'Why do you not write them yourself?' I said, with some bitterness.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27224' title='27224'>'I will, my dear Watson, I will. </span>
<span sid='27225' title='27225'>At present I am, as you know, fairly busy, but I propose to devote my declining years to the composition of a textbook which shall focus the whole art of detection into one volume. </span>
<span sid='27226' title='27226'>Our present research appears to be a case of murder.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27227' title='27227'>'You think this Sir Eustace is dead, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27228' title='27228'>'I should say so. </span>
<span sid='27229' title='27229'>Hopkins's writing shows considerable agitation, and he is not an emotional man. </span>
<span sid='27230' title='27230'>Yes, I gather there has been violence, and that the body is left for our inspection. </span>
<span sid='27231' title='27231'>A mere suicide would not have caused him to send for me. </span>
<span sid='27232' title='27232'>As to the release of the lady, it would appear that she has been locked in her room during the tragedy. </span>
<span sid='27233' title='27233'>We are moving in high life, Watson - crackling paper, "EB" monogram, coat-of-arms, picturesque address. </span>
<span sid='27234' title='27234'>I think that friend Hopkins will live up to his reputation, and that we shall have an interesting morning. </span>
<span sid='27235' title='27235'>The crime was committed before twelve last night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27236' title='27236'>'How can you possibly tell?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27237' title='27237'>'By an inspection of the trains and by reckoning the time. </span>
<span sid='27238' title='27238'>The local police had to be called in, they had to communicate with <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>, Hopkins had to go out, and he in turn had to send for me. </span>
<span sid='27239' title='27239'>All that makes a fair night's work. </span>
<span sid='27240' title='27240'>Well, here we are at Chislehurst Station, and we shall soon set our doubts at rest.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27241' title='27241'>A drive of a couple of miles through narrow country lanes brought us to a park gate, which was opened for us by an old lodge-keeper, whose haggard face bore the reflection of some great disaster. </span>
<span sid='27242' title='27242'>The avenue ran through a noble park, between lines of ancient elms, and ended in a low, widespread house, pillared in front after the fashion of Palladio. </span>
<span sid='27243' title='27243'>The central part was evidently of a great age and shrouded in ivy, but the large windows showed that modern changes had been carried out, and one wing of the house appeared to be entirely new. </span>
<span sid='27244' title='27244'>The youthful figure and alert, eager face of Inspector Stanley Hopkins confronted us in the open doorway.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27245' title='27245'>'I'm very glad you have come, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='27246' title='27246'>And you, too, Dr Watson! </span>
<span sid='27247' title='27247'>But, indeed, if I had my time over again I should not have troubled you, for since the lady has come to herself she has given so clear an account of the affair that there is not much left for us to do. </span>
<span sid='27248' title='27248'>You remember that <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lewisham&t=h'>Lewisham</a> gang of burglars?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27249' title='27249'>'What, the three Randalls?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27250' title='27250'>'Exactly; the father and two sons. </span>
<span sid='27251' title='27251'>It's their work. </span>
<span sid='27252' title='27252'>I have not a doubt of it. </span>
<span sid='27253' title='27253'>They did a job at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sydenham&t=h'>Sydenham</a> a fortnight ago, and were seen and described. </span>
<span sid='27254' title='27254'>Rather cool to do another so soon and so near; but it is they, beyond all doubt. </span>
<span sid='27255' title='27255'>It's a hanging matter this time.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27256' title='27256'>'Sir Eustace is dead, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27257' title='27257'>'Yes; his head was knocked in with his own poker.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27258' title='27258'>'Sir Eustace Brackenstall, the driver tells me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27259' title='27259'>'Exactly - one of the richest men in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kent&t=h'>Kent</a>. </span>
<span sid='27260' title='27260'>Lady Brackenstall is in the morning-room. </span>
<span sid='27261' title='27261'>Poor lady, she has had a most dreadful experience. </span>
<span sid='27262' title='27262'>She seemed half dead when I saw her first. </span>
<span sid='27263' title='27263'>I think you had best see her and hear her account of the facts. </span>
<span sid='27264' title='27264'>Then we will examine the dining-room together.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27265' title='27265'>Lady Brackenstall was no ordinary person. </span>
<span sid='27266' title='27266'>Seldom have I seen so graceful a figure, so womanly a presence, and so beautiful a face. </span>
<span sid='27267' title='27267'>She was a blonde, golden-haired, blue- eyed, and would, no doubt, have had the perfect complexion which goes with such colouring had not her recent experience left her drawn and haggard. </span>
<span sid='27268' title='27268'>Her sufferings were physical as well as mental, for over one eye rose a hideous, plum-coloured swelling, which her maid, a tall, austere woman, was bathing assiduously with vinegar and water. </span>
<span sid='27269' title='27269'>The lady lay back exhausted upon a couch, but her quick, observant gaze as we entered the room, and the alert expression of her beautiful features, showed that neither her wits nor her courage had been shaken by her terrible experience. </span>
<span sid='27270' title='27270'>She was enveloped in a loose dressing-gown of blue and silver, but a black sequin-covered dinner-dress was hung upon the couch beside her.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27271' title='27271'>'I have told you all that happened, Mr Hopkins,' she said wearily; 'could you not repeat it for me? </span>
<span sid='27272' title='27272'>Well, if you think it necessary, I will tell these gentlemen what occurred. </span>
<span sid='27273' title='27273'>Have they been in the dining-room yet?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27274' title='27274'>'I thought they had better hear your ladyship's story first.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27275' title='27275'>'I shall be glad when you can arrange matters. </span>
<span sid='27276' title='27276'>It is horrible to me to think of him still lying there.' </span>
<span sid='27277' title='27277'>She shuddered and buried her face for a moment in her hands. </span>
<span sid='27278' title='27278'>As she did so the loose gown fell back from her forearm. </span>
<span sid='27279' title='27279'>Holmes uttered an exclamation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27280' title='27280'>'You have other injuries, madam! </span>
<span sid='27281' title='27281'>What is this?' </span>
<span sid='27282' title='27282'>Two vivid red spots stood out in one of the white, round limbs. </span>
<span sid='27283' title='27283'>She hastily covered it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27284' title='27284'>'It is nothing. </span>
<span sid='27285' title='27285'>It has no connection with the hideous business of last night. </span>
<span sid='27286' title='27286'>If you and your friend will sit down I will tell you all I can.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27287' title='27287'>'I am the wife of Sir Eustace Brackenstall. </span>
<span sid='27288' title='27288'>I have been married about a year. </span>
<span sid='27289' title='27289'>I suppose that it is no use my attempting to conceal that our marriage has not been a happy one. </span>
<span sid='27290' title='27290'>I fear that all our neighbours would tell you that,- even if I were to attempt to deny it. </span>
<span sid='27291' title='27291'>Perhaps the fault may be partly mine. </span>
<span sid='27292' title='27292'>I was brought up in the freer, less conventional atmosphere of South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Australia&t=h'>Australia</a>, and this English life, with its proprieties and its primness, is not congenial to me. </span>
<span sid='27293' title='27293'>But the main reason lies in the one fact which is notorious to everyone, and that is that Sir Eustace was a confirmed drunkard. </span>
<span sid='27294' title='27294'>To be with such a man for an hour is unpleasant. </span>
<span sid='27295' title='27295'>Can you imagine what it means for a sensitive and high-spirited woman to be tied to him for day and night? </span>
<span sid='27296' title='27296'>It is a sacrilege, a crime, a villainy to hold that such a marriage is binding. </span>
<span sid='27297' title='27297'>I say that these monstrous laws of yours will bring a curse upon the land - Heaven will not let such wickedness endure.' </span>
<span sid='27298' title='27298'>For an instant she sat up, her cheeks flushed, and her eyes blazing from under the terrible mark upon her brow. </span>
<span sid='27299' title='27299'>Then the strong, soothing hand of the austere maid drew her head down on to the cushion, and the wild anger died away into passionate sobbing. </span>
<span sid='27300' title='27300'>At last she continued:</span>
<p>
<span sid='27301' title='27301'>'I will tell you about last night. </span>
<span sid='27302' title='27302'>You are aware, perhaps, that in this house all servants sleep in the modern wing. </span>
<span sid='27303' title='27303'>This central block is made up of the dwelling-rooms, with the kitchen behind and our bedroom above. </span>
<span sid='27304' title='27304'>My maid Theresa sleeps above my room. </span>
<span sid='27305' title='27305'>There is no one else, and no sound could alarm those who are in the farther wing. </span>
<span sid='27306' title='27306'>This must have been well known to the robbers, or they would not have acted as they did.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27307' title='27307'>'Sir Eustace retired about half-past ten. </span>
<span sid='27308' title='27308'>The servants had already gone to their quarters. </span>
<span sid='27309' title='27309'>Only my maid was up, and she had remained in her room at the top of the house until I needed her services. </span>
<span sid='27310' title='27310'>I sat until after eleven in this room, absorbed in a book. </span>
<span sid='27311' title='27311'>Then I walked round to see that all was right before I went upstairs. </span>
<span sid='27312' title='27312'>It was my custom to do this myself, for, as I have explained, Sir Eustace was not always to be trusted. </span>
<span sid='27313' title='27313'>I went into the kitchen, the butler's pantry, the gun-room, the billiard-room, the drawing-room, and finally the dining-room. </span>
<span sid='27314' title='27314'>As I approached the window, which is covered with thick curtains, I suddenly felt the wind blown upon my face, and realized that it was open. </span>
<span sid='27315' title='27315'>I flung the curtain aside, and found myself face to face with a broad- shouldered, elderly man who had just stepped into the room. </span>
<span sid='27316' title='27316'>The window is a long French one, which really forms a door leading to the lawn. </span>
<span sid='27317' title='27317'>I held my bedroom candle lit in my hand, and, by its light, behind the first man I saw two others, who were in the act of entering. </span>
<span sid='27318' title='27318'>I stepped back, but the fellow was on me in an instant. </span>
<span sid='27319' title='27319'>He caught me first by the wrist and then by the throat. </span>
<span sid='27320' title='27320'>I opened my mouth to scream, but he struck me a savage blow with his fist over the eye, and felled me to the ground. </span>
<span sid='27321' title='27321'>I must have been unconscious for a few minutes, for when I came to myself I found that they had torn down the bell-rope and had secured me tightly to the oaken chair which stands at the head of the dining-room table. </span>
<span sid='27322' title='27322'>I was so firmly bound that I could not move, and a handkerchief round my mouth prevented me from uttering any sound. </span>
<span sid='27323' title='27323'>It was at this instant that my unfortunate husband entered the room. </span>
<span sid='27324' title='27324'>He had evidently heard some suspicious sounds, and he came prepared for such a scene as he found. </span>
<span sid='27325' title='27325'>He was dressed in his shirt and trousers, with his favourite blackthorn cudgel in his hand. </span>
<span sid='27326' title='27326'>He rushed at one of the burglars, but another - it was the elderly man - stooped, picked the poker out of the grate, and struck him a terrible blow as he passed He fell without a groan, and never moved again. </span>
<span sid='27327' title='27327'>I fainted once more, but again it could only have been a very few minutes during which I was insensible. </span>
<span sid='27328' title='27328'>When I opened my eyes I found that they had collected the silver from the sideboard, and they had drawn a bottle of wine which stood there. </span>
<span sid='27329' title='27329'>Each of them had a glass in his hand. </span>
<span sid='27330' title='27330'>I have already told you, have I not, that one was elderly, with a beard, and the others young, hairless lads. </span>
<span sid='27331' title='27331'>They might have been a father with his two sons. </span>
<span sid='27332' title='27332'>They talked together in whispers. </span>
<span sid='27333' title='27333'>Then they came over and made sure that I was still securely bound. </span>
<span sid='27334' title='27334'>Finally they withdrew, closing the window after them. </span>
<span sid='27335' title='27335'>It was quite a quarter of an hour before I got my mouth free. </span>
<span sid='27336' title='27336'>When I did so my screams brought the maid to my assistance. </span>
<span sid='27337' title='27337'>The other servants were soon alarmed, and we sent for the local police, who instantly communicated with <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='27338' title='27338'>That is really all I can tell you, gentlemen, and I trust that it will not be necessary for me to go over so painful a story again.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27339' title='27339'>'Any questions, Mr Holmes?' said Hopkins.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27340' title='27340'>'I will not impose any further tax upon Lady Brackenstall's patience and time,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='27341' title='27341'>'Before I go into the dining-room I should be glad to hear your experience.' </span>
<span sid='27342' title='27342'>He looked at the maid.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27343' title='27343'>'I saw the men before ever they came into the house,' said she. </span>
<span sid='27344' title='27344'>'As I sat by my bedroom window I saw three men in the moonlight down by the lodge gate yonder, but I thought nothing of it at the time. </span>
<span sid='27345' title='27345'>It was more than an hour after that I heard my mistress scream, and down I ran, to find her, poor lamb, just as she says, and him on the floor with his blood and brains over the room. </span>
<span sid='27346' title='27346'>It was enough to drive a woman out of her wits, tied there, and her very dress spotted with him; but she never wanted courage, did Miss Mary Fraser of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Adelaide&t=h'>Adelaide</a>, and Lady Brackenstall of Abbey Grange hasn't learned new ways. </span>
<span sid='27347' title='27347'>You've questioned her long enough, you gentlemen, and now she is coming to her own room, just with her old Theresa, to get the rest that she badly needs.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27348' title='27348'>With a motherly tenderness the gaunt woman put her arm round her mistress and led her from the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27349' title='27349'>'She has been with her all her life,' said Hopkins. </span>
<span sid='27350' title='27350'>'Nursed her as a baby, and came with her to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> when they first left <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Australia&t=h'>Australia</a> eighteen months ago. </span>
<span sid='27351' title='27351'>Theresa Wright is her name, and the kind of maid you don't pick up nowadays. </span>
<span sid='27352' title='27352'>This way, Mr Holmes, if you please!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27353' title='27353'>The keen interest had passed out of Holmes's expressive face, and I knew that with the mystery all the charm of the case had departed. </span>
<span sid='27354' title='27354'>There still remained an arrest to be effected, but what were these commonplace rogues that he should soil his hands with them? </span>
<span sid='27355' title='27355'>An abstruse and learned specialist who finds that he has been called in for a case of measles would experience something of the annoyance which I read in my friend's eyes. </span>
<span sid='27356' title='27356'>Yet the scene in the dining-room of the Abbey Grange was sufficiently strange to arrest his attention and to recall his waning interest.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27357' title='27357'>It was a very large and high chamber, with carved oak ceiling, oaken panelling, and a fine array of deers' heads and ancient weapons around the walls. </span>
<span sid='27358' title='27358'>At the farther end from the door was the high French window of which we had heard. </span>
<span sid='27359' title='27359'>Three smaller windows on the right-hand side filled the apartment with cold winter sunshine. </span>
<span sid='27360' title='27360'>On the left was a large, deep fireplace, with a massive over-hanging oak mantelpiece. </span>
<span sid='27361' title='27361'>Beside the fireplace was a heavy oaken chair with arms and cross-bars at the bottom. </span>
<span sid='27362' title='27362'>In and out through the open woodwork was woven a crimson cord, which was secured at each side to the crosspiece below. </span>
<span sid='27363' title='27363'>In releasing the lady the cord had been slipped off her, but the knots with which it had been secured still remained. </span>
<span sid='27364' title='27364'>These details only struck our attention afterwards, for our thoughts were entirely absorbed by the terrible object which lay spread upon the tiger-skin hearthrug in front of the fire.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27365' title='27365'>It was the body of a tall, well-made man, about forty years of age. </span>
<span sid='27366' title='27366'>He lay upon his back, his face upturned, with his white teeth grinning through his short, black beard. </span>
<span sid='27367' title='27367'>His two clenched hands were raised above his head, and a heavy blackthorn stick lay across them. </span>
<span sid='27368' title='27368'>His dark, handsome, aquiline features were convulsed into a spasm of vindictive hatred, which had set his dead face in a terribly fiendish expression. </span>
<span sid='27369' title='27369'>He had evidently been in his bed when the alarm had broken out, for he wore a foppish, embroidered night-shirt, and his bare feet projected from his trousers. </span>
<span sid='27370' title='27370'>His head was horribly injured, and the whole room bore witness to the savage ferocity of the blow which had struck him down. </span>
<span sid='27371' title='27371'>Beside him lay the heavy poker, bent into a curve by the concussion. </span>
<span sid='27372' title='27372'>Holmes examined both it and the indescribable wreck which it had wrought.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27373' title='27373'>'He must be a powerful man, this elder Randall,' he remarked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27374' title='27374'>'Yes,' said Hopkins. </span>
<span sid='27375' title='27375'>'I have some record of the fellow, and he is a rough customer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27376' title='27376'>'You should have no difficulty in getting him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27377' title='27377'>'Not the slightest. </span>
<span sid='27378' title='27378'>We have been on the look-out for him, and there was some idea that he had got away to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>. </span>
<span sid='27379' title='27379'>Now we know that the gang are here I don't see how they can escape. </span>
<span sid='27380' title='27380'>We have the news at every seaport already, and a reward will be offered before evening. </span>
<span sid='27381' title='27381'>What beats me is how they could have done so mad a thing, knowing that the lady would describe them, and that we could not fail to recognize the description.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27382' title='27382'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='27383' title='27383'>One would have expected that they would have silenced Lady Brackenstall as well.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27384' title='27384'>'They may not have realized,' I suggested, 'that she had recovered from her faint.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27385' title='27385'>'That is likely enough. </span>
<span sid='27386' title='27386'>If she seemed to be senseless they would not take her life. </span>
<span sid='27387' title='27387'>What about this poor fellow, Hopkins? </span>
<span sid='27388' title='27388'>I seem to have heard some queer stories about him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27389' title='27389'>'He was a good-hearted man when he was sober, but a perfect devil when he was drunk, or rather when he was half drunk, for he seldom really went the whole way. </span>
<span sid='27390' title='27390'>The devil seemed to be in him at such times, and he was capable of anything. </span>
<span sid='27391' title='27391'>From what I hear, in spite of all his wealth and his title, he very nearly came our way once or twice. </span>
<span sid='27392' title='27392'>There was a scandal about his drenching a dog with petroleum and setting it on fire	her ladyship's dog, to make the matter worse - and that was only hushed up with difficulty. </span>
<span sid='27393' title='27393'>Then he threw a decanter at that maid Theresa Wright; there was trouble about that. </span>
<span sid='27394' title='27394'>On the whole, and between ourselves, it will be a brighter house without him. </span>
<span sid='27395' title='27395'>What are you looking at now?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27396' title='27396'>Holmes was down on his knees examining with great attention the knots upon the red cord with which the lady had been secured. </span>
<span sid='27397' title='27397'>Then he carefully scrutinized the broken and frayed end where it had snapped off when the burglar had dragged it down.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27398' title='27398'>'When this was pulled down the bell in the kitchen must have rung loudly,' he remarked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27399' title='27399'>'No one could hear it. </span>
<span sid='27400' title='27400'>The kitchen stands right at the back of the house.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27401' title='27401'>'How did the burglar know no one would hear it? </span>
<span sid='27402' title='27402'>How dare he pull at a bell-rope in that reckless fashion?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27403' title='27403'>'Exactly, Mr Holmes, exactly. </span>
<span sid='27404' title='27404'>You put the very question which I have asked myself again and again. </span>
<span sid='27405' title='27405'>There can be no doubt that this fellow must have known the house and its habits. </span>
<span sid='27406' title='27406'>He must have perfectly understood that the servants would all be in bed at that comparatively early hour, and that no one could possibly hear a bell ring in the kitchen. </span>
<span sid='27407' title='27407'>Therefore he must have been in close league with one of the servants. </span>
<span sid='27408' title='27408'>Surely that is evident. </span>
<span sid='27409' title='27409'>But there are eight servants, and all of good character.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27410' title='27410'>'Other things being equal,' said Holmes, 'one would suspect the one at whose head the master threw a decanter. </span>
<span sid='27411' title='27411'>And yet that would involve treachery towards the mistress to whom this woman seems devoted. </span>
<span sid='27412' title='27412'>Well, well, the point is a minor one, and when you have Randall you will probably find no difficulty in securing his accomplices. </span>
<span sid='27413' title='27413'>The lady's story certainly seems to be corroborated, if it needed corroboration, by every detail which we see before us.' </span>
<span sid='27414' title='27414'>He walked to the French window and threw it open. </span>
<span sid='27415' title='27415'>'There are no signs here, but the ground is iron hard, and one would not expect them. </span>
<span sid='27416' title='27416'>I see that these candles on the mantelpiece have been lighted.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27417' title='27417'>'Yes, it was by their light and that of the lady's bedroom candle that the burglars saw their way about.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27418' title='27418'>'And what did they take?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27419' title='27419'>'Well, they did not take much - only half a dozen articles of plate off the sideboard. </span>
<span sid='27420' title='27420'>Lady Brackenstall thinks that they were themselves so disturbed by the death of Sir Eustace that they did not ransack the house as they would otherwise have done.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27421' title='27421'>'No doubt that is true. </span>
<span sid='27422' title='27422'>And yet they drank some wine, I understand.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27423' title='27423'>'To steady their own nerves.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27424' title='27424'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='27425' title='27425'>These three glasses upon the sideboard have been untouched, I suppose?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27426' title='27426'>'Yes; and the bottle stands as they left it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27427' title='27427'>'Let us look at it. </span>
<span sid='27428' title='27428'>Hullo, hullo! what is this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27429' title='27429'>The three glasses were grouped together, all of them tinged with wine, and one of them containing some dregs of bee-swing. </span>
<span sid='27430' title='27430'>The bottle stood near them, two-thirds full, and beside it lay a long, deeply stained cork. </span>
<span sid='27431' title='27431'>Its appearance and the dust upon the bottle showed that it was no common vintage which the murderers had enjoyed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27432' title='27432'>A change had come over Holmes's manner. </span>
<span sid='27433' title='27433'>He had lost his listless expression, and again I saw an alert light of interest in his keen deep-set eyes. </span>
<span sid='27434' title='27434'>He raised the cork and examined it minutely.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27435' title='27435'>'How did they draw it?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27436' title='27436'>Hopkins pointed to a half-opened drawer. </span>
<span sid='27437' title='27437'>In it lay some table linen and a large corkscrew.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27438' title='27438'>'Did Lady Brackenstall say that screw was used?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27439' title='27439'>'No; you remember that she was senseless at the moment when the bottle was opened.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27440' title='27440'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='27441' title='27441'>As a matter of fact, that screw was not used. </span>
<span sid='27442' title='27442'>This bottle was opened by a pocket-screw, probably contained in a knife, and not more than an inch and a half long. </span>
<span sid='27443' title='27443'>If you examine the top of the cork you will observe that the screw was driven in three times before the cork was extracted. </span>
<span sid='27444' title='27444'>It has never been transfixed. </span>
<span sid='27445' title='27445'>This long screw would have transfixed it and drawn it with a single pull. </span>
<span sid='27446' title='27446'>When you catch this fellow you will find that he has one of these multiplex knives in his possession.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27447' title='27447'>'Excellent!' said Hopkins.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27448' title='27448'>'But these glasses do puzzle me, I confess. </span>
<span sid='27449' title='27449'>Lady Brackenstall actually saw the three men drinking, did she not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27450' title='27450'>'Yes; she was clear about that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27451' title='27451'>'Then there is an end of it. </span>
<span sid='27452' title='27452'>What more is to be said? </span>
<span sid='27453' title='27453'>And yet you must admit that the three glasses are very remarkable, Hopkins. </span>
<span sid='27454' title='27454'>What, you see nothing remarkable? </span>
<span sid='27455' title='27455'>Well, well, let it pass. </span>
<span sid='27456' title='27456'>Perhaps when a man has special knowledge and special powers like my own it rather encourages him to seek a complex explanation when a simpler one is at hand. </span>
<span sid='27457' title='27457'>Of course, it must be a mere chance about the glasses. </span>
<span sid='27458' title='27458'>Well, good morning, Hopkins, I don't see that I can be of any use to you, and you appear to have your case very clear. </span>
<span sid='27459' title='27459'>You will let me know when Randall is arrested, and any further developments which may occur. </span>
<span sid='27460' title='27460'>I trust that I shall soon have to congratulate you upon a successful conclusion. </span>
<span sid='27461' title='27461'>Come, Watson, I fancy that we may employ ourselves more profitably at home.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27462' title='27462'>During our return journey I could see by Holmes's face that he was much puzzled by something which he had observed. </span>
<span sid='27463' title='27463'>Every now and then, by an effort, he would throw off the impression and talk as if the matter were clear, but then his doubts would settle down upon him again, and his knitted brows and abstracted eyes would show that his thoughts had gone back once more to the great dining-room of the Abbey Grange in which this midnight tragedy had been enacted. </span>
<span sid='27464' title='27464'>At last, by a sudden impulse, just as our train was crawling out of a suburban station, he sprang on to the platform and pulled me out after him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27465' title='27465'>'Excuse me, my dear fellow,' said he, as we watched the rear carriages of our train disappearing round a curve; 'I am sorry to make you the victim of what may seem a mere whim, but on my life, Watson, I simply can't leave that case in this condition. </span>
<span sid='27466' title='27466'>Every instinct that I possess cries out against it. </span>
<span sid='27467' title='27467'>It's wrong - it's all wrong - I'll swear that it's wrong. </span>
<span sid='27468' title='27468'>And yet the lady's story was complete, the maid's corroboration was sufficient, the detail was fairly exact. </span>
<span sid='27469' title='27469'>What have I to put against that? </span>
<span sid='27470' title='27470'>Three wine-glasses, that is all. </span>
<span sid='27471' title='27471'>But if I had not taken things for granted, if I had examined everything with the care which I would have shown had we approached the case de novo and had no cut-and-dried story to warp my mind, would I not then have found something more definite to go upon? </span>
<span sid='27472' title='27472'>Of course I should. </span>
<span sid='27473' title='27473'>Sit down on this bench, Watson, until a train for Chislehurst arrives, and allow me to lay the evidence before you, imploring you in the first instance to dismiss from your mind the idea that anything which the maid or mistress may have said must necessarily be true. </span>
<span sid='27474' title='27474'>The lady's charming personality must not be permitted to warp our judgement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27475' title='27475'>'Surely there are details in her story which, if we look at it in cold blood, would excite our suspicion. </span>
<span sid='27476' title='27476'>These burglars made a considerable haul at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sydenham&t=h'>Sydenham</a> a fortnight ago. </span>
<span sid='27477' title='27477'>Some account of them and their appearance was in the papers, and would naturally occur to anyone who wished to invent a story in which imaginary robbers should play a part. </span>
<span sid='27478' title='27478'>As a matter of fact, burglars who have done a good stroke of business are, as a rule, only too glad to enjoy the proceeds in peace and quiet without embarking on another perilous undertaking. </span>
<span sid='27479' title='27479'>Again, it is unusual for burglars to strike a lady to prevent her screaming, since one would imagine that was the sure way to make her scream; it is unusual for them to commit murder when their numbers are sufficient to overpower one man; it is unusual for them to be content with a limited plunder when there is much more within their reach; and, finally, I should say that it was very unusual for such men to leave a bottle half empty. </span>
<span sid='27480' title='27480'>How do all these unusuals strike you, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27481' title='27481'>'Their cumulative effect is certainly considerable, and yet each of them is quite possible in itself. </span>
<span sid='27482' title='27482'>The most unusual thing of all, as it seems to me, is that the lady should be tied to the chair.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27483' title='27483'>'Well, I am not so sure about that, Watson, for it is evident that they must either kill her or else secure her in such a way that she could not give immediate notice of their escape. </span>
<span sid='27484' title='27484'>But at any rate I have shown, have I not, that there is a certain element of improbability about the lady's story? </span>
<span sid='27485' title='27485'>And now on the top of this comes the incident of the wine-glasses.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27486' title='27486'>'What about the wine-glasses?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27487' title='27487'>'Can you see them in your mind's eye?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27488' title='27488'>'I see them clearly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27489' title='27489'>'We are told that three men drank from them. </span>
<span sid='27490' title='27490'>Does that strike you as likely?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27491' title='27491'>'Why not? </span>
<span sid='27492' title='27492'>There was wine in each glass.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27493' title='27493'>'Exactly; but there was bee-swing only in one glass. </span>
<span sid='27494' title='27494'>You must have noticed that fact. </span>
<span sid='27495' title='27495'>What does that suggest to your mind?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27496' title='27496'>The last glass filled would be most likely to contain bee-swing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27497' title='27497'>'Not at all. </span>
<span sid='27498' title='27498'>The bottle was full of it, and it is inconceivable that the first two glasses were clear and the third heavily charged with it. </span>
<span sid='27499' title='27499'>There are two possible explanations, and only two. </span>
<span sid='27500' title='27500'>One is that after the second glass was filled the bottle was violently agitated, and so the third glass received the bee-swing. </span>
<span sid='27501' title='27501'>That does not appear probable. </span>
<span sid='27502' title='27502'>No, no; I am sure that I am right.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27503' title='27503'>'What, then, do you suppose?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27504' title='27504'>'That only two glasses were used, and that the dregs of both were poured into a third glass, so as to give the false impression that three people had been there. </span>
<span sid='27505' title='27505'>In that way all the bee-swing would be in the last glass, would it not? </span>
<span sid='27506' title='27506'>Yes, am convinced that this is so. </span>
<span sid='27507' title='27507'>But if I have hit upon the true explanation of this one small phenomenon, then in an instant the case rises from the commonplace to the exceedingly remarkable, for it can only mean that Lady Brackenstall and her maid have deliberately lied to us, that not one word of their story is to be believed, that they have some very strong reason for covering the real criminal, and that we must construct our case for ourselves without any help from them. </span>
<span sid='27508' title='27508'>That is the mission which now lies before us, and here, Watson, is the Chislehurst train?</span>
<p>
<span sid='27509' title='27509'>The household of the Abbey Grange were much surprised at our return, but Sherlock Holmes, finding that Stanley Hopkins had gone off to report to headquarters, took possession of the dining-room, locked the door upon the inside and devoted himself for two hours to one of those minute and laborious investigations which formed the solid basis on which his brilliant edifices of deduction were reared. </span>
<span sid='27510' title='27510'>Seated in a corner like an interested student who observes the demonstration of his professor, I followed every step of that remarkable research. </span>
<span sid='27511' title='27511'>The window, the curtains, the carpet, the chair, the rope - each in turn was minutely examined and duly pondered. </span>
<span sid='27512' title='27512'>The body of the unfortunate baronet had been removed, but all else remained as we had seen it in the morning. </span>
<span sid='27513' title='27513'>Then, to my astonishment, Holmes climbed up on to the massive mantelpiece. </span>
<span sid='27514' title='27514'>Far above his head hung the few inches of red cord which were still attached to the wire. </span>
<span sid='27515' title='27515'>For a long time he gazed upwards at it, and then in an attempt to get nearer to it he rested his knee upon a wooden bracket on the wall. </span>
<span sid='27516' title='27516'>This brought his hand within a few inches of' the broken end of the rope; but it was not this so much as the bracket itself which seemed to engage his attention. </span>
<span sid='27517' title='27517'>Finally he sprang down with an ejaculation of satisfaction.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27518' title='27518'>'It's all right, Watson,' said he. </span>
<span sid='27519' title='27519'>'We have got our case - one of the most remarkable in our collection. </span>
<span sid='27520' title='27520'>But, dear me, how slow-witted I have been, and how nearly I have committed the blunder of my lifetime! </span>
<span sid='27521' title='27521'>Now, I think that with a few missing links my chain is almost complete.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27522' title='27522'>'You have got your men?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27523' title='27523'>'Man, Watson, man. </span>
<span sid='27524' title='27524'>Only one, but a very formidable person. </span>
<span sid='27525' title='27525'>Strong as a lion - witness the blow which bent that poker. </span>
<span sid='27526' title='27526'>Six foot three in height, active as a squirrel, dexterous with his fingers; finally, remarkably quick-witted, for this whole ingenious story is of his concoction. </span>
<span sid='27527' title='27527'>Yes, Watson, we have come upon the handiwork of a very remarkable individual. </span>
<span sid='27528' title='27528'>And yet in that bell-rope he has given us a clue which should not have left us a doubt.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27529' title='27529'>'Where was the clue?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27530' title='27530'>'Well, if you were to pull down a bell-rope, Watson, where would you expect it to break? </span>
<span sid='27531' title='27531'>Surely at the spot where it is attached to the wire. </span>
<span sid='27532' title='27532'>Why should it break three inches from the top as this one has done?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27533' title='27533'>'Because it is frayed there?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27534' title='27534'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='27535' title='27535'>This end, which we can examine, is frayed. </span>
<span sid='27536' title='27536'>He was cunning enough to do that with his knife. </span>
<span sid='27537' title='27537'>But the other end is not frayed. </span>
<span sid='27538' title='27538'>You could not observe that from here, but if you were on the mantelpiece you would see that it is cut clean off without any mark of fraying whatever. </span>
<span sid='27539' title='27539'>You can reconstruct what occurred. </span>
<span sid='27540' title='27540'>The man needed the rope. </span>
<span sid='27541' title='27541'>He would not tear it down for fear of giving the alarm by ringing the bell. </span>
<span sid='27542' title='27542'>What did he do? </span>
<span sid='27543' title='27543'>He sprang up on the mantelpiece, could not quite reach it, put his knee on the bracket - you will see the impression in the dust - and got his knife to bear upon the cord. </span>
<span sid='27544' title='27544'>I could not reach the place by at least three inches, from which I infer that he is at least three inches a bigger man than I. </span>
<span sid='27545' title='27545'>Look at that mark upon the seat of the oaken chair! </span>
<span sid='27546' title='27546'>What is it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27547' title='27547'>'Blood.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27548' title='27548'>'Undoubtedly it is blood. </span>
<span sid='27549' title='27549'>This alone puts the lady's story out of court. </span>
<span sid='27550' title='27550'>If she were seated on the chair when the crime was done, how comes that mark? </span>
<span sid='27551' title='27551'>No, no; she was placed in the chair after the death of her husband. </span>
<span sid='27552' title='27552'>I'll wager that the black dress shows a corresponding mark to this. </span>
<span sid='27553' title='27553'>We have not yet met our Waterloo, Watson, but this is our <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Marengo&t=h'>Marengo</a>, for it begins in defeat and ends in victory. </span>
<span sid='27554' title='27554'>I should like now to have a few words with the nurse Theresa. </span>
<span sid='27555' title='27555'>We must be wary for a while, if we are to get the information which we want.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27556' title='27556'>She was an interesting person, this stern <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Australia&t=h'>Australia</a>n nurse. </span>
<span sid='27557' title='27557'>Taciturn, suspicious, ungracious, it took some time before Holmes's pleasant manner and frank acceptance of all that she said thawed her into a corresponding amiability. </span>
<span sid='27558' title='27558'>She did not attempt to conceal her hatred for her late employer.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27559' title='27559'>'Yes, sir, it is true that he threw the decanter at me. </span>
<span sid='27560' title='27560'>I heard him call my mistress a name, and I told him that he would not dare to speak so if her brother had been there. </span>
<span sid='27561' title='27561'>Then it was that he threw it at me. </span>
<span sid='27562' title='27562'>He might have thrown a dozen if he had but left my bonny bird alone. </span>
<span sid='27563' title='27563'>He was for ever ill-treating her, and she too proud to complain. </span>
<span sid='27564' title='27564'>She will not even tell me all that he has done to her. </span>
<span sid='27565' title='27565'>She never told me of those marks on her arm that you saw this morning, but I know very well that they come from a stab with a hat-pin. </span>
<span sid='27566' title='27566'>The sly devil - God forgive me that I should speak of him so, now that he is dead, but a devil he was if ever one walked the earth. </span>
<span sid='27567' title='27567'>He was all honey when we first met him, only eighteen months ago, and we both feel as if it were eighteen years. </span>
<span sid='27568' title='27568'>She had only just arrived in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27569' title='27569'>'Yes, it was her first voyage she had never been from home before. </span>
<span sid='27570' title='27570'>He won her with his tide and his money and his false <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> ways. </span>
<span sid='27571' title='27571'>If she made a mistake she has paid for it, if ever a woman did. </span>
<span sid='27572' title='27572'>What month did we meet him? </span>
<span sid='27573' title='27573'>Well, I tell you it was just after we arrived. </span>
<span sid='27574' title='27574'>We arrived in June, and it was July. </span>
<span sid='27575' title='27575'>They were married in January of last year. </span>
<span sid='27576' title='27576'>Yes, she is down in the morning-room again, and I have no doubt she will see you, but you must not ask too much of her, for she has gone through all that flesh and blood will stand.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27577' title='27577'>Lady Brackenstall was reclining on the same couch, but looked brighter than before. </span>
<span sid='27578' title='27578'>The maid had entered with us, and began once more to foment the bruise upon her mistress's brow.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27579' title='27579'>'I hope,' said the lady, 'that you have not come to cross-examine me again?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27580' title='27580'>'No,' Holmes answered, in his gentlest voice, 'I will not cause you any unnecessary trouble, Lady Brackenstall, and my whole desire is to make things easy for you, for I am convinced that you are a much-tried woman. </span>
<span sid='27581' title='27581'>If you will treat me as a friend and trust me, you may find that I will justify your trust.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27582' title='27582'>'What do you want me to do?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27583' title='27583'>'To tell me the truth.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27584' title='27584'>'Mr Holmes!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27585' title='27585'>'No, no, Lady Brackenstall, it is no use. </span>
<span sid='27586' title='27586'>You may have heard of any little reputation which I possess. </span>
<span sid='27587' title='27587'>I will stake it all on the fact that your story is an absolute fabrication.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27588' title='27588'>Mistress and maid were both staring at Holmes with pale faces and frightened eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27589' title='27589'>'You are an impudent fellow!' cried Theresa. </span>
<span sid='27590' title='27590'>'Do you mean to say that my mistress has told a lie?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27591' title='27591'>Holmes rose from his chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27592' title='27592'>'Have you nothing to tell me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27593' title='27593'>'I have told you everything.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27594' title='27594'>'Think once more, Lady Brackenstall. </span>
<span sid='27595' title='27595'>Would it not be better to be frank?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27596' title='27596'>For an instant there was hesitation in her beautiful face. </span>
<span sid='27597' title='27597'>Then some new strong thought caused it to set like a mask.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27598' title='27598'>'I have told you all I know.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27599' title='27599'>Holmes took his hat and shrugged his shoulders. </span>
<span sid='27600' title='27600'>'I am sorry,' he said, and without another word we left the room and the house. </span>
<span sid='27601' title='27601'>There was a pond in the park, and to this my friend led the way. </span>
<span sid='27602' title='27602'>It was frozen over, but a single hole was left for the convenience of a solitary swan. </span>
<span sid='27603' title='27603'>Holmes gazed at it, and then passed on to the lodge gate. </span>
<span sid='27604' title='27604'>There he scribbled a short note for Stanley Hopkins, and left it with the lodge-keeper.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27605' title='27605'>'It may be a hit, or it may be a miss, but we are bound to do something for friend Hopkins, just to justify this second visit,' said he. </span>
<span sid='27606' title='27606'>'I will not quite take him into my confidence yet. </span>
<span sid='27607' title='27607'>I think our next scene of operations must be the shipping office of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Adelaide&t=h'>Adelaide</a> - <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Southampton&t=h'>Southampton</a> line, which stands at the end of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pall Mall&t=h'>Pall Mall</a>, if I remember right. </span>
<span sid='27608' title='27608'>There is a second line of steamers which connect South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Australia&t=h'>Australia</a> with <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, but we will draw the larger cover first.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27609' title='27609'>Holmes's card sent in to the manager ensured instant attention, and he was not long in acquiring all the information which he needed. </span>
<span sid='27610' title='27610'>In June of '95 only one of their line had reached a home port. </span>
<span sid='27611' title='27611'>It was the Rock of Gibraltar, their largest and best boat. </span>
<span sid='27612' title='27612'>A reference to the passenger list showed that Miss Fraser of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Adelaide&t=h'>Adelaide</a>, with her maid, had made the voyage in her. </span>
<span sid='27613' title='27613'>The boat was now on her way to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Australia&t=h'>Australia</a>, somewhere to the south of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Suez Canal&t=h'>Suez Canal</a>. </span>
<span sid='27614' title='27614'>Her officers were the same as in '95, with one exception. </span>
<span sid='27615' title='27615'>The first officer, Mr Jack Croker, had been made a captain, and was to take charge of their new ship, the Bass Rock, sailing in two days' time from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Southampton&t=h'>Southampton</a>. </span>
<span sid='27616' title='27616'>He lived at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sydenham&t=h'>Sydenham</a>, but he was likely to be in that morning for instructions, if we cared to wait for him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27617' title='27617'>No; Mr Holmes had no desire to see him, but would be glad to know more about his record and character.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27618' title='27618'>His record was magnificent. </span>
<span sid='27619' title='27619'>There was not an officer in the fleet to touch him. </span>
<span sid='27620' title='27620'>As to his character, he was reliable on duty, but a wild, desperate fellow off the deck of his ship, hot-headed, excitable, but loyal, honest, and kind-hearted. </span>
<span sid='27621' title='27621'>That was the pith of the information with which Holmes left the office of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Adelaide&t=h'>Adelaide</a> - <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Southampton&t=h'>Southampton</a> Company. </span>
<span sid='27622' title='27622'>Thence he drove to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>, but instead of entering he sat in his cab with his brows drawn down, lost in profound thought. </span>
<span sid='27623' title='27623'>Finally he drove round to the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Charing Cross&t=h'>Charing Cross</a> telegraph office, sent off a message, and then, at last, we made for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> once more.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27624' title='27624'>'No, I couldn't do it, Watson,' said he, as we re-entered our room. </span>
<span sid='27625' title='27625'>'Once that warrant was made out nothing on earth would save him. </span>
<span sid='27626' title='27626'>Once or twice in my career I feel that I have done more real harm by my discovery of the criminal than ever he had done by his crime. </span>
<span sid='27627' title='27627'>I have learned caution now, and I had rather play tricks with the law of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> than with my own conscience. </span>
<span sid='27628' title='27628'>Let us know a little more before we act.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27629' title='27629'>Before evening we had a visit from Inspector Stanley Hopkins. </span>
<span sid='27630' title='27630'>Things were not going very well with him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27631' title='27631'>'I believe that you are a wizard, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='27632' title='27632'>I really do sometimes think that you have powers that are not human. </span>
<span sid='27633' title='27633'>Now, how on earth could you know that the stolen silver was at the bottom of that pond?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27634' title='27634'>'I didn't know it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27635' title='27635'>'But you told me to examine it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27636' title='27636'>'You got it then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27637' title='27637'>'Yes, I got it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27638' title='27638'>'I am very glad if I have helped you.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27639' title='27639'>'But you haven't helped me. </span>
<span sid='27640' title='27640'>You have made the affair far more difficult. </span>
<span sid='27641' title='27641'>What sort of burglars are they who steal silver and then throw it into the nearest pond?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27642' title='27642'>'It was certainly rather eccentric behaviour. </span>
<span sid='27643' title='27643'>I was merely going on the idea that if the silver had been taken by persons who did not want it, who merely took it for a blind, as it were, then they would naturally be anxious to get rid of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27644' title='27644'>'But why should such an idea cross your mind?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27645' title='27645'>'Well, I thought it was possible. </span>
<span sid='27646' title='27646'>When they came out through the French window there was the pond, with one tempting little hole in the ice right in front of their noses. </span>
<span sid='27647' title='27647'>Could there be a better hiding-place?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27648' title='27648'>'Ah, a hiding-place - that is better!' cried Stanley Hopkins. </span>
<span sid='27649' title='27649'>'Yes, yes, I see it all now! </span>
<span sid='27650' title='27650'>It was early, there were folk upon the roads, they were afraid of being seen with the silver, so they sank it in the pond, intending to return for it when the coast was clear. </span>
<span sid='27651' title='27651'>Excellent, Mr Holmes - that is better than your idea of a blind.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27652' title='27652'>'Quite so; you have got an admirable theory. </span>
<span sid='27653' title='27653'>I have no doubt that my own ideas were quite wild, but you must admit that they have ended in discovering the silver.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27654' title='27654'>'Yes, sir; yes. </span>
<span sid='27655' title='27655'>It was all your doing. </span>
<span sid='27656' title='27656'>But I have had a bad set-back.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27657' title='27657'>'A set-back?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27658' title='27658'>'Yes, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='27659' title='27659'>The Randall gang were arrested in New <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=York&t=h'>York</a> this morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27660' title='27660'>'Dear me, Hopkins. </span>
<span sid='27661' title='27661'>That is certainly rather against your theory that they committed a murder in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kent&t=h'>Kent</a> last night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27662' title='27662'>'It is fatal, Mr Holmes, absolutely fatal. </span>
<span sid='27663' title='27663'>Still, there are other gangs of three besides the Randalls, or it may be some new gang of which the police have never heard.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27664' title='27664'>'Quite so; it is perfectly possible. </span>
<span sid='27665' title='27665'>What, are you off?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27666' title='27666'>'Yes, Mr Holmes; there is no rest for me until I have got to the bottom of the business. </span>
<span sid='27667' title='27667'>I suppose you have no hint to give me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27668' title='27668'>'I have given you one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27669' title='27669'>'Which?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27670' title='27670'>'Well, I suggested a blind.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27671' title='27671'>'But why, Mr Holmes, why?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27672' title='27672'>'Ah, that's the question, of course. </span>
<span sid='27673' title='27673'>But I commend the idea to your mind. </span>
<span sid='27674' title='27674'>You might possibly find that there was something in it. </span>
<span sid='27675' title='27675'>You won't stop for dinner? </span>
<span sid='27676' title='27676'>Well, good-bye, and let us know how you get on.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27677' title='27677'>Dinner was over and the table cleared before Holmes alluded to the matter again. </span>
<span sid='27678' title='27678'>He had lit his pipe, and held his slippered feet to the cheerful blaze of the fire. </span>
<span sid='27679' title='27679'>Suddenly he looked at his watch.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27680' title='27680'>'I expect developments, Watson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27681' title='27681'>'When?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27682' title='27682'>'Now - within a few minutes. </span>
<span sid='27683' title='27683'>I dare say you thought I acted rather badly to Stanley Hopkins just now?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27684' title='27684'>'I trust your judgement.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27685' title='27685'>'A very sensible reply, Watson. </span>
<span sid='27686' title='27686'>You must look at it this way; what I know is unofficial; what he knows is official. </span>
<span sid='27687' title='27687'>I have the right to private judgment, but he has none. </span>
<span sid='27688' title='27688'>He must disclose all, or he is a traitor to his service. </span>
<span sid='27689' title='27689'>In a doubtful case I would not put him in so painful a position, and so I reserve my information until my own mind is clear upon the matter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27690' title='27690'>'But when will that be?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27691' title='27691'>'The time has come. </span>
<span sid='27692' title='27692'>You will now be present at the last scene of a remarkable little drama.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27693' title='27693'>There was a sound upon the stairs, and our door was opened to admit as fine a specimen of manhood as ever passed through it. </span>
<span sid='27694' title='27694'>He was a very tall young man, golden- moustached, blue-eyed, with a skin which had been burned by tropical suns, and a springy step which showed that the huge frame was as active as it was strong. </span>
<span sid='27695' title='27695'>He closed the door behind him, and then he stood with clenched hands and heaving breast, choking down some overmastering emotion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27696' title='27696'>'Sit down, Captain Croker. </span>
<span sid='27697' title='27697'>You got my telegram?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27698' title='27698'>Our visitor sank into an arm-chair and looked from one to the other of us with questioning eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27699' title='27699'>'I got your telegram, and I came at the hour you said. </span>
<span sid='27700' title='27700'>I heard that you had been down to the office. </span>
<span sid='27701' title='27701'>There was no getting away from you. </span>
<span sid='27702' title='27702'>Let's hear the worst. </span>
<span sid='27703' title='27703'>What are you going to do with me? </span>
<span sid='27704' title='27704'>Arrest me? </span>
<span sid='27705' title='27705'>Speak out, man! </span>
<span sid='27706' title='27706'>You can't sit there and play with me like a cat with a mouse.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27707' title='27707'>'Give him a cigar,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='27708' title='27708'>'Bite on that, Captain Croker, and don't let your nerves run away with you. </span>
<span sid='27709' title='27709'>I should not sit here smoking with you if I thought that you were a common criminal, you may be sure of that. </span>
<span sid='27710' title='27710'>Be frank with me, and we may do some good. </span>
<span sid='27711' title='27711'>Play tricks with me, and I'll crush you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27712' title='27712'>'What do you wish me to do?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27713' title='27713'>'To give me a true account of all that happened at the Abbey Grange last night - a true account, mind you, with nothing added and nothing taken off. </span>
<span sid='27714' title='27714'>I know so much already that if you go one inch off the straight I'll blow this police whistle from my window and the affair goes out of my hands for ever.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27715' title='27715'>The sailor thought for a little. </span>
<span sid='27716' title='27716'>Then he struck his leg with his great sunburnt hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27717' title='27717'>'I'll chance it,' he cried. </span>
<span sid='27718' title='27718'>'I believe you are a man of your word, and a white man, and I'll tell you the whole story. </span>
<span sid='27719' title='27719'>But one thing I will say first. </span>
<span sid='27720' title='27720'>So far as I am concerned, I regret nothing and I fear nothing, and I would do it all again and be proud of the job. </span>
<span sid='27721' title='27721'>Damn the beast - if he had as many lives as a cat he would owe them all to me! </span>
<span sid='27722' title='27722'>But it's the lady, Mary - Mary Fraser - for never will I call her by that accursed name. </span>
<span sid='27723' title='27723'>When I think of getting her into trouble, I who would give my life just to bring one smile to her dear face, it's that that turns my soul into water. </span>
<span sid='27724' title='27724'>And yet - and yet - what less could I do? </span>
<span sid='27725' title='27725'>I'll tell you my story, gentlemen, and then I'll ask you as man to man what less could I do.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27726' title='27726'>'I must go back a bit. </span>
<span sid='27727' title='27727'>You seem to know everything, so I expect that you know that I met her when she was a passenger and I was the first officer of the Rock of Gibraltar. </span>
<span sid='27728' title='27728'>From the first day I met her she was the only woman to me. </span>
<span sid='27729' title='27729'>Every day of that voyage I loved her more, and many a time since have I kneeled down in the darkness of the night watch and kissed the deck of that ship because I knew her dear feet had trod it. </span>
<span sid='27730' title='27730'>She was never engaged to me. </span>
<span sid='27731' title='27731'>She treated me as fairly as ever a woman treated a man. </span>
<span sid='27732' title='27732'>I have no complaint to make. </span>
<span sid='27733' title='27733'>It was all love on my side, and all good comradeship and friendship on hers. </span>
<span sid='27734' title='27734'>When we parted she was a free woman, but I could never again be a free man.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27735' title='27735'>'Next time I came back from sea I heard of her marriage. </span>
<span sid='27736' title='27736'>Well, why shouldn't she marry whom she liked? </span>
<span sid='27737' title='27737'>Title and money - who could carry them better than she? </span>
<span sid='27738' title='27738'>She was born for all that is beautiful and dainty. </span>
<span sid='27739' title='27739'>I didn't grieve over her marriage. </span>
<span sid='27740' title='27740'>I was not such a selfish hound as that. </span>
<span sid='27741' title='27741'>I just rejoiced that good luck had come her way, and that she had not thrown herself away on a penniless sailor. </span>
<span sid='27742' title='27742'>That's how I loved Mary Fraser.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27743' title='27743'>'Well, I never thought to see her again; but last voyage I was promoted, and the new boat was not yet launched, so I had to wait for a couple of months with my people at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sydenham&t=h'>Sydenham</a>. </span>
<span sid='27744' title='27744'>One day out in a country lane I met Theresa Wright, her old maid. </span>
<span sid='27745' title='27745'>She told me about her, about him, about everything. </span>
<span sid='27746' title='27746'>I tell you, gentlemen, it nearly drove me mad. </span>
<span sid='27747' title='27747'>This drunken hound, that he should dare to raise his hand to her whose boots he was not worthy to lick! </span>
<span sid='27748' title='27748'>I met Theresa again. </span>
<span sid='27749' title='27749'>Then I met Mary herself - and met her again. </span>
<span sid='27750' title='27750'>Then she would meet me no more. </span>
<span sid='27751' title='27751'>But the other day I had a notice that I was to start on my voyage within a week, and I determined that I would see her once before I left. </span>
<span sid='27752' title='27752'>Theresa was always my friend, for she loved Mary and hated this villain almost as much as I did. </span>
<span sid='27753' title='27753'>From her I learned the ways of the house. </span>
<span sid='27754' title='27754'>Mary used to sit up reading in her own little room downstairs. </span>
<span sid='27755' title='27755'>I crept round there last night and scratched at the window. </span>
<span sid='27756' title='27756'>At first she would not open to me, but in her heart I know that now she loves me, and she could not leave me in the frosty night. </span>
<span sid='27757' title='27757'>She whispered to me to come round to the big front window, and I found it open before me so as to let me into the dining-room. </span>
<span sid='27758' title='27758'>Again I heard from her own lips things that made my blood boil, and again I cursed this brute who mishandled the woman that I loved. </span>
<span sid='27759' title='27759'>Well, gentlemen, I was standing with her just inside the window, in all innocence, as God is my judge, when he rushed like a madman into the room, called her the vilest name that a man could use to a woman, and welted her across the face with the stick he had in his hand. </span>
<span sid='27760' title='27760'>I had sprung for the poker, and it was a fair fight between us. </span>
<span sid='27761' title='27761'>See here on my arm where his first blow fell. </span>
<span sid='27762' title='27762'>Then it was my turn, and I went through him as if he had been a rotten pumpkin. </span>
<span sid='27763' title='27763'>Do you think I was sorry? </span>
<span sid='27764' title='27764'>Not I! </span>
<span sid='27765' title='27765'>It was his life or mine; but far more than that - it was his life or hers, for how could I leave her in the power of this madman? </span>
<span sid='27766' title='27766'>That was how I killed him. </span>
<span sid='27767' title='27767'>Was I wrong? </span>
<span sid='27768' title='27768'>Well, then, what would either of you gentlemen have done if you had been in my position?</span>
<p>
<span sid='27769' title='27769'>'She had screamed when he struck her, and that brought old Theresa down from the room above. </span>
<span sid='27770' title='27770'>There was a bottle of wine on the sideboard, and I opened it and poured a little between Mary's lips, for she was half dead with the shock. </span>
<span sid='27771' title='27771'>Then I took a drop myself. </span>
<span sid='27772' title='27772'>Theresa was as cool as ice, and it was her plot as much as mine. </span>
<span sid='27773' title='27773'>We must make it appear that burglars had done the thing. </span>
<span sid='27774' title='27774'>Theresa kept on repeating our story to her mistress, while I swarmed up and cut the rope of the bell. </span>
<span sid='27775' title='27775'>Then I lashed her in her chair, and frayed out the end of the rope to make it look natural, else they would wonder how in the world a burglar could have got up there to cut it. </span>
<span sid='27776' title='27776'>Then I gathered up a few plates and pots of silver, to carry out the idea of a robbery, and there I left them, with orders to give the alarm when I had a quarter of an hour's start. </span>
<span sid='27777' title='27777'>I dropped the silver into the pond and made off for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sydenham&t=h'>Sydenham</a>, feeling that for once in my life I had done a real good night's work. </span>
<span sid='27778' title='27778'>And that's the truth and the whole truth, Mr Holmes, if it costs me my neck.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27779' title='27779'>Holmes smoked for some time in silence. </span>
<span sid='27780' title='27780'>Then he crossed the room and shook our visitor by the hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27781' title='27781'>'That's what I think,' said he. </span>
<span sid='27782' title='27782'>'I know that every word is true, for you have hardly said a word which I did not know. </span>
<span sid='27783' title='27783'>No one but an acrobat or a sailor could have got up to the bell-rope from the bracket, and no one but a sailor could have made the knots with which the cord was fastened to the chair. </span>
<span sid='27784' title='27784'>Only once had this lady been brought into contact with sailors, and that was on her voyage, and it was someone of her own class of life, since she was trying hard to shield him and so showing that she loved him. </span>
<span sid='27785' title='27785'>You see how easy it was for me to lay my hands upon you when once I had started upon the right trail.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27786' title='27786'>'I thought the police never could have seen through our dodge.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27787' title='27787'>'And the police haven't; nor will they, to the best of my belief. </span>
<span sid='27788' title='27788'>Now, look here, Captain Croker, this is a very serious matter, though I am willing to admit that you acted under the most extreme provocation to which any man could be subjected. </span>
<span sid='27789' title='27789'>I am not sure that in defence of your own life your action will not be pronounced legitimate. </span>
<span sid='27790' title='27790'>However, that is for a British jury to decide. </span>
<span sid='27791' title='27791'>Meanwhile I have so much sympathy for you that if you choose to disappear in the next twenty-four hours I will promise you that no one will hinder you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27792' title='27792'>'And then it will all come out?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27793' title='27793'>'Certainly it will come out.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27794' title='27794'>The sailor flushed with anger.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27795' title='27795'>'What sort of proposal is that to make to a man? </span>
<span sid='27796' title='27796'>I know enough of law to understand that Mary would be had as accomplice. </span>
<span sid='27797' title='27797'>Do you think I would leave her alone to face the music while I slunk away? </span>
<span sid='27798' title='27798'>No, sir; let them do their worst upon me, but for Heaven's sake, Mr Holmes, find some way of keeping my poor Mary out of the courts.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27799' title='27799'>Holmes for the second time held out his hand to the sailor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27800' title='27800'>'I was only testing you, and you ring true every time. </span>
<span sid='27801' title='27801'>Well, it is a great responsibility that I take upon myself, but I have given Hopkins an excellent hint, and if he can't avail himself of it I can do no more. </span>
<span sid='27802' title='27802'>See here, Captain Croker, we'll do this in due form of law. </span>
<span sid='27803' title='27803'>You are the prisoner. </span>
<span sid='27804' title='27804'>Watson, you are a British jury, and I never met a man who was more eminently fitted to represent one. </span>
<span sid='27805' title='27805'>I am the judge. </span>
<span sid='27806' title='27806'>Now, gentlemen of the jury, you have heard the evidence. </span>
<span sid='27807' title='27807'>Do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27808' title='27808'>'Not guilty, my lord,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27809' title='27809'>'Vox populi, vox Dei. </span>
<span sid='27810' title='27810'>You are acquitted, Captain Croker. </span>
<span sid='27811' title='27811'>So long as the law does not find some other victim, you are safe from me. </span>
<span sid='27812' title='27812'>Come back to this lady in a year, and may her future and yours justify us in the judgment which we have pronounced this night.'</span>
