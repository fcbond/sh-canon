<p>
<span sid='55658' title='55658'>I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year, and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman, with fiery red hair. </span>
<span sid='55659' title='55659'>With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw, when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room, and closed the door behind me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55660' title='55660'>'You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,' he said cordially.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55661' title='55661'>'I was afraid that you were engaged!</span>
<p>
<span sid='55662' title='55662'>'So I am. </span>
<span sid='55663' title='55663'>Very much so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55664' title='55664'>'Then I can wait in the next room.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55665' title='55665'>'Not at all. </span>
<span sid='55666' title='55666'>This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55667' title='55667'>The stout gentleman half rose from his chair, and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small, fat-encircled eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55668' title='55668'>'Try the settee,' said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair, and putting his finger-tips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. </span>
<span sid='55669' title='55669'>'I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. </span>
<span sid='55670' title='55670'>You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55671' title='55671'>'Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,' I observed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55672' title='55672'>'You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55673' title='55673'>'A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55674' title='55674'>'You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep piling fact upon fact on you, until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. </span>
<span sid='55675' title='55675'>Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time. </span>
<span sid='55676' title='55676'>You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. </span>
<span sid='55677' title='55677'>As far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to. </span>
<span sid='55678' title='55678'>Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. </span>
<span sid='55679' title='55679'>I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part, but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. </span>
<span sid='55680' title='55680'>As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. </span>
<span sid='55681' title='55681'>In the present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55682' title='55682'>The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride, and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his great-coat. </span>
<span sid='55683' title='55683'>As he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward, and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man, and endeavoured after the fashion of my companion to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55684' title='55684'>I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. </span>
<span sid='55685' title='55685'>Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. </span>
<span sid='55686' title='55686'>He wore rather baggy grey shepherds' check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. </span>
<span sid='55687' title='55687'>A frayed top-hat, and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. </span>
<span sid='55688' title='55688'>Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55689' title='55689'>Sherlock Holmes's quick eye took in my occupation and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. </span>
<span sid='55690' title='55690'>'Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=China&t=h'>China</a>, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55691' title='55691'>Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55692' title='55692'>'How, in the name of good fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?' he asked. </span>
<span sid='55693' title='55693'>'How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour? </span>
<span sid='55694' title='55694'>It's as true as gospel, and I began as a ship's carpenter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55695' title='55695'>'Your hands, my dear sir. </span>
<span sid='55696' title='55696'>Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. </span>
<span sid='55697' title='55697'>You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55698' title='55698'>'Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55699' title='55699'>'I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc and compass breastpin.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55700' title='55700'>'Ah, of course, I forgot that. </span>
<span sid='55701' title='55701'>But the writing?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55702' title='55702'>'What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55703' title='55703'>'Well, but <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=China&t=h'>China</a>?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55704' title='55704'>'The fish which you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=China&t=h'>China</a>. </span>
<span sid='55705' title='55705'>I have made a small study of tattoo marks, and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. </span>
<span sid='55706' title='55706'>That trick of staining the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=China&t=h'>China</a>. </span>
<span sid='55707' title='55707'>When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55708' title='55708'>Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. </span>
<span sid='55709' title='55709'>'Well, I never!' said he. </span>
<span sid='55710' title='55710'>'I thought at first you had done something clever, but I see that there was nothing in it after all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55711' title='55711'>'I begin to think, Watson,' said Holmes, 'that I make a mistake in explaining. </span>
<span sid='55712' title='55712'>"Omne ignotum pro magnifico," you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. </span>
<span sid='55713' title='55713'>Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55714' title='55714'>'Yes, I have got it now,' he answered, with his thick, red finger planted half-way down the column. </span>
<span sid='55715' title='55715'>'Here it is. </span>
<span sid='55716' title='55716'>This is what began it all. </span>
<span sid='55717' title='55717'>You just read it for yourself, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55718' title='55718'>I took the paper from him and read as follows:</span>
<p>
<span sid='55719' title='55719'>'To THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE. - On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lebanon&t=h'>Lebanon</a>, Penn., U.S.A. </span>
<span sid='55720' title='55720'>there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of four pounds a week for purely nominal services. </span>
<span sid='55721' title='55721'>All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind, and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. </span>
<span sid='55722' title='55722'>Apply in person on Monday, at eleven o'clock, to Duncan <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a>, at the offices of the League, 7 <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pope's Court&t=h'>Pope's Court</a>, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Fleet Street&t=h'>Fleet Street</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55723' title='55723'>'What on earth does this mean?' I ejaculated, after I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55724' title='55724'>Holmes chuckled, and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high spirits. </span>
<span sid='55725' title='55725'>'It is a little off the beaten track, isn't it?' said he. </span>
<span sid='55726' title='55726'>'And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch, and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes. </span>
<span sid='55727' title='55727'>You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper and the date.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55728' title='55728'>'It is The Morning Chronicle, of April 27, 1890. </span>
<span sid='55729' title='55729'>Just two months ago.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55730' title='55730'>'Very good. </span>
<span sid='55731' title='55731'>Now, Mr. Wilson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55732' title='55732'>'Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,' said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead, 'I have a small pawnbroker's business at Coburg Square, near the City. </span>
<span sid='55733' title='55733'>It's not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. </span>
<span sid='55734' title='55734'>I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him, but that he is willing to come for half wages, so as to learn the business.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55735' title='55735'>'What is the name of this obliging youth?' asked Sherlock Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55736' title='55736'>'His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he's not such a youth either. </span>
<span sid='55737' title='55737'>It's hard to say his age. </span>
<span sid='55738' title='55738'>I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better himself, and earn twice what I am able to give him. </span>
<span sid='55739' title='55739'>But after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55740' title='55740'>'Why, indeed? </span>
<span sid='55741' title='55741'>You seem most fortunate in having an employé who comes under the full market price. </span>
<span sid='55742' title='55742'>It is not a common experience among employers in this age. </span>
<span sid='55743' title='55743'>I don't know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55744' title='55744'>'Oh, he has his faults, too,' said Mr. Wilson. </span>
<span sid='55745' title='55745'>'Never was such a fellow for photography. </span>
<span sid='55746' title='55746'>Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. </span>
<span sid='55747' title='55747'>That is his main fault; but on the whole, he's a good worker. </span>
<span sid='55748' title='55748'>There's no vice in him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55749' title='55749'>'He is still with you, I presume?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55750' title='55750'>'Yes, sir. </span>
<span sid='55751' title='55751'>He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking, and keeps the place clean - that's all I have in the house, for I am a widower, and never had any family. </span>
<span sid='55752' title='55752'>We live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads, and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55753' title='55753'>'The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. </span>
<span sid='55754' title='55754'>Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks with this very paper in his hand, and he says:</span>
<p>
<span sid='55755' title='55755'>'"I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a redheaded man."</span>
<p>
<span sid='55756' title='55756'>'"Why that?" I asks.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55757' title='55757'>'"Why," says he, "here's another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men. </span>
<span sid='55758' title='55758'>It's worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits' end what to do with the money. </span>
<span sid='55759' title='55759'>If my hair would only change colour, here's a nice little crib all ready for me to step into."</span>
<p>
<span sid='55760' title='55760'>'"Why, what is it, then?" I asked. </span>
<span sid='55761' title='55761'>You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and, as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. </span>
<span sid='55762' title='55762'>In that way I didn't know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55763' title='55763'>'"Have you never heard of the League of the Redheaded Men?" he asked, with his eyes open.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55764' title='55764'>'"Never."</span>
<p>
<span sid='55765' title='55765'>'"Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies."</span>
<p>
<span sid='55766' title='55766'>'"And what are they worth?" I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55767' title='55767'>'"Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere much with one's other occupations."</span>
<p>
<span sid='55768' title='55768'>'Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55769' title='55769'>'"Tell me all about it," said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55770' title='55770'>'"Well," said he, showing me the advertisement, "you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars. </span>
<span sid='55771' title='55771'>As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. </span>
<span sid='55772' title='55772'>He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. </span>
<span sid='55773' title='55773'>From all I hear it is splendid pay, and very little to do."</span>
<p>
<span sid='55774' title='55774'>'"But," said I, "there would be millions of redheaded men who would apply."</span>
<p>
<span sid='55775' title='55775'>'"Not so many as you might think," he answered. </span>
<span sid='55776' title='55776'>"You see, it is really confined to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>ers, and to grown men. </span>
<span sid='55777' title='55777'>This <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n had started from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn. </span>
<span sid='55778' title='55778'>Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real, bright, blazing, fiery red. </span>
<span sid='55779' title='55779'>Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds."</span>
<p>
<span sid='55780' title='55780'>'Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that, if there was to be any competition in the matter, I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. </span>
<span sid='55781' title='55781'>Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day, and to come right away with me. </span>
<span sid='55782' title='55782'>He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up, and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55783' title='55783'>'I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. </span>
<span sid='55784' title='55784'>From north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the City to answer the advertisement. </span>
<span sid='55785' title='55785'><a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Fleet Street&t=h'>Fleet Street</a> was choked with red-headed folk, and <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pope's Court&t=h'>Pope's Court</a> looked like a coster's orange barrow. </span>
<span sid='55786' title='55786'>I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement. </span>
<span sid='55787' title='55787'>Every shade of colour they were - straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. </span>
<span sid='55788' title='55788'>When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. </span>
<span sid='55789' title='55789'>How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office. </span>
<span sid='55790' title='55790'>There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could, and soon found ourselves in the office.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55791' title='55791'>'Your experience has been a most entertaining one,' remarked Holmes, as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff. </span>
<span sid='55792' title='55792'>'Pray continue your very interesting statement.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55793' title='55793'>'There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man, with a head that was even redder than mine. </span>
<span sid='55794' title='55794'>He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. </span>
<span sid='55795' title='55795'>Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter after all. </span>
<span sid='55796' title='55796'>However, when our turn came, the little man was more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55797' title='55797'>'"This is Mr. Jabez Wilson," said my assistant, "and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League."</span>
<p>
<span sid='55798' title='55798'>'"And he is admirably suited for it," the other answered. </span>
<span sid='55799' title='55799'>"He has every requirement. </span>
<span sid='55800' title='55800'>I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine." </span>
<span sid='55801' title='55801'>He took a step backwards, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. </span>
<span sid='55802' title='55802'>Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55803' title='55803'>'"It would be injustice to hesitate," said he. </span>
<span sid='55804' title='55804'>"You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution." </span>
<span sid='55805' title='55805'>With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain. </span>
<span sid='55806' title='55806'>"There is water in your eyes," said he, as he released me. </span>
<span sid='55807' title='55807'>"I perceive that all is as it should be. </span>
<span sid='55808' title='55808'>But we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. </span>
<span sid='55809' title='55809'>I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax which would disgust you with human nature." </span>
<span sid='55810' title='55810'>He stepped over to the window, and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. </span>
<span sid='55811' title='55811'>A groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions, until there was not a red head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55812' title='55812'>'"My name," said he, "is Mr. Duncan <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a>, and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. </span>
<span sid='55813' title='55813'>Are you a married man, Mr. Wilson? </span>
<span sid='55814' title='55814'>Have you a family?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='55815' title='55815'>'I answered that I had not.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55816' title='55816'>'His face fell immediately.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55817' title='55817'>'"Dear me!" </span>
<span sid='55818' title='55818'>he said gravely, "that is very serious indeed! </span>
<span sid='55819' title='55819'>I am sorry to hear you say that. </span>
<span sid='55820' title='55820'>The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. </span>
<span sid='55821' title='55821'>It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor."</span>
<p>
<span sid='55822' title='55822'>'My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes, he said that it would be all right.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55823' title='55823'>'"In the case of another," said he, "the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours. </span>
<span sid='55824' title='55824'>When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='55825' title='55825'>'"Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already," said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55826' title='55826'>'"Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!" said Vincent Spaulding. </span>
<span sid='55827' title='55827'>"I shall be able to look after that for you."</span>
<p>
<span sid='55828' title='55828'>'"What would be the hours?" I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55829' title='55829'>'"Ten to two."</span>
<p>
<span sid='55830' title='55830'>'Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. </span>
<span sid='55831' title='55831'>Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55832' title='55832'>'"That would suit me very well," said I. </span>
<span sid='55833' title='55833'>"And the pay?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='55834' title='55834'>'"Is four pounds a week."</span>
<p>
<span sid='55835' title='55835'>'"And the work?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='55836' title='55836'>'"Is purely nominal."</span>
<p>
<span sid='55837' title='55837'>'"What do you call purely nominal?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='55838' title='55838'>'"Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time. </span>
<span sid='55839' title='55839'>If you leave, you forfeit your whole position for ever. </span>
<span sid='55840' title='55840'>The will is very clear upon that point. </span>
<span sid='55841' title='55841'>You don't comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time."</span>
<p>
<span sid='55842' title='55842'>'"It's only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving," said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55843' title='55843'>'"No excuse will avail," said Mr. Duncan <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a>, "neither sickness, nor business, nor anything else. </span>
<span sid='55844' title='55844'>There you must stay, or you lose your billet."</span>
<p>
<span sid='55845' title='55845'>'"And the work?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='55846' title='55846'>'"Is to copy out the Encyclopaedia Britannica. </span>
<span sid='55847' title='55847'>There is the first volume of it in that press. </span>
<span sid='55848' title='55848'>You must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. </span>
<span sid='55849' title='55849'>Will you be ready tomorrow?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='55850' title='55850'>'"Certainly," I answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55851' title='55851'>'"Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain." </span>
<span sid='55852' title='55852'>He bowed me out of the room, and I went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55853' title='55853'>'Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine. </span>
<span sid='55854' title='55854'>It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the Encyclopædia Britannica. </span>
<span sid='55855' title='55855'>Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. </span>
<span sid='55856' title='55856'>However, in the morning I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pope's Court&t=h'>Pope's Court</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55857' title='55857'>'Well, to my surprise and delight everything was as right as possible. </span>
<span sid='55858' title='55858'>The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a> was there to see that I got fairly to work. </span>
<span sid='55859' title='55859'>He started me off upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me. </span>
<span sid='55860' title='55860'>At two o'clock he bade me good day, complimented me upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office after me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55861' title='55861'>'This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week's work. </span>
<span sid='55862' title='55862'>It was the same next week, and the same the week after. </span>
<span sid='55863' title='55863'>Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I left  at two. </span>
<span sid='55864' title='55864'>By degrees Mr. Duncan <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a> took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all. </span>
<span sid='55865' title='55865'>Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55866' title='55866'>'Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots, and Archery, and Armour, and Architecture, and Attica, and hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B's before very long. </span>
<span sid='55867' title='55867'>It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings. </span>
<span sid='55868' title='55868'>And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55869' title='55869'>'To an end?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55870' title='55870'>'Yes, sir. </span>
<span sid='55871' title='55871'>And no later than this morning. </span>
<span sid='55872' title='55872'>I went to my work as usual at ten o'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. </span>
<span sid='55873' title='55873'>Here it is, and you can read for yourself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55874' title='55874'>He held up a piece of white cardboard, about the size of a sheet of note-paper. </span>
<span sid='55875' title='55875'>It read in this fashion:</span>
<p>
<span sid='55876' title='55876'>'THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55877' title='55877'>OCT. 9, 1890.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55878' title='55878'>Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely over-topped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55879' title='55879'>'I cannot see that there is anything very funny,' cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. </span>
<span sid='55880' title='55880'>'If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55881' title='55881'>'No, no,' cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. </span>
<span sid='55882' title='55882'>'I really wouldn't miss your case for the world. </span>
<span sid='55883' title='55883'>It is most refreshingly unusual. </span>
<span sid='55884' title='55884'>But there is, if you will excuse me saying so, something just a little funny about it. </span>
<span sid='55885' title='55885'>Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55886' title='55886'>'I was staggered, sir. </span>
<span sid='55887' title='55887'>I did not know what to do. </span>
<span sid='55888' title='55888'>Then I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. </span>
<span sid='55889' title='55889'>Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. </span>
<span sid='55890' title='55890'>He said that he had never heard of any such body. </span>
<span sid='55891' title='55891'>Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a> was. </span>
<span sid='55892' title='55892'>He answered that the name was new to him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55893' title='55893'>'"Well," said I, "the gentleman at No. 4."</span>
<p>
<span sid='55894' title='55894'>'"What, the red-headed man?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='55895' title='55895'>'"Yes."</span>
<p>
<span sid='55896' title='55896'>'"Oh," said he, "his name was William Morris. </span>
<span sid='55897' title='55897'>He was a solicitor, and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. </span>
<span sid='55898' title='55898'>He moved out yesterday."</span>
<p>
<span sid='55899' title='55899'>'"Where could I find him?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='55900' title='55900'>'"Oh, at his new offices. </span>
<span sid='55901' title='55901'>He did tell me the address. </span>
<span sid='55902' title='55902'>Yes, 17 <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=King Edward Street&t=h'>King Edward Street</a>, near St. Paul's."</span>
<p>
<span sid='55903' title='55903'>'I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris, or Mr. Duncan <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55904' title='55904'>'And what did you do then?' asked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55905' title='55905'>'I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant. </span>
<span sid='55906' title='55906'>But he could not help me in any way. </span>
<span sid='55907' title='55907'>He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. </span>
<span sid='55908' title='55908'>But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. </span>
<span sid='55909' title='55909'>I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55910' title='55910'>'And you did very wisely,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='55911' title='55911'>'Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. </span>
<span sid='55912' title='55912'>From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55913' title='55913'>'Grave enough!' said Mr. Jabez Wilson. </span>
<span sid='55914' title='55914'>'Why, I have lost four pounds a week.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55915' title='55915'>'As far as you are personally concerned, remarked Holmes, 'I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. </span>
<span sid='55916' title='55916'>On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some thirty pounds, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. </span>
<span sid='55917' title='55917'>You have lost nothing by them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55918' title='55918'>'No, sir. </span>
<span sid='55919' title='55919'>But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank - if it was a prank - upon me. </span>
<span sid='55920' title='55920'>It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two-and-thirty pounds.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55921' title='55921'>'We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. </span>
<span sid='55922' title='55922'>And, first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. </span>
<span sid='55923' title='55923'>This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement - how long had he been with you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55924' title='55924'>'About a month then.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55925' title='55925'>'How did he come?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55926' title='55926'>'In answer to an advertisement.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55927' title='55927'>'Was he the only applicant?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55928' title='55928'>'No, I had a dozen.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55929' title='55929'>'Why did you pick him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55930' title='55930'>'Because he was handy, and would come cheap.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55931' title='55931'>'At half wages, in fact.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55932' title='55932'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55933' title='55933'>'What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55934' title='55934'>'Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he's not short of thirty. </span>
<span sid='55935' title='55935'>Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55936' title='55936'>Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55937' title='55937'>'I thought as much,' said he. </span>
<span sid='55938' title='55938'>'Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for ear-rings?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55939' title='55939'>'Yes, sir. </span>
<span sid='55940' title='55940'>He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55941' title='55941'>'Hum!' said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. </span>
<span sid='55942' title='55942'>'He is still with you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55943' title='55943'>'Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55944' title='55944'>'And has your business been attended to in your absence?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55945' title='55945'>'Nothing to complain of, sir. </span>
<span sid='55946' title='55946'>There's never very much to do of a morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55947' title='55947'>'That will do, Mr. Wilson. </span>
<span sid='55948' title='55948'>I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. </span>
<span sid='55949' title='55949'>To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55950' title='55950'>'Well, Watson,' said Holmes, when our visitor had left us, 'what do you make of it all?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55951' title='55951'>'I make nothing of it,' I answered, frankly. </span>
<span sid='55952' title='55952'>'It is a most mysterious business.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55953' title='55953'>'As a rule,' said Holmes, 'the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. </span>
<span sid='55954' title='55954'>It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify. </span>
<span sid='55955' title='55955'>But I must be prompt over this matter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55956' title='55956'>'What are you going to do then?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55957' title='55957'>'To smoke,' he answered. </span>
<span sid='55958' title='55958'>'It is quite a three-pipe problem, and I beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes.' </span>
<span sid='55959' title='55959'>He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. </span>
<span sid='55960' title='55960'>I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who had made up his mind, and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55961' title='55961'>'Sarasate plays at the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=St. James's Hall&t=h'>St. James's Hall</a> this afternoon,' he remarked. </span>
<span sid='55962' title='55962'>'What do you think, Watson? </span>
<span sid='55963' title='55963'>Could your patients spare you for a few hours?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55964' title='55964'>'I have nothing to do to-day. </span>
<span sid='55965' title='55965'>My practice is never very absorbing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55966' title='55966'>'Then put on your hat, and come. </span>
<span sid='55967' title='55967'>I am going through the City first, and we can have some lunch on the way. </span>
<span sid='55968' title='55968'>I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French. </span>
<span sid='55969' title='55969'>It is introspective, and I want to introspect. </span>
<span sid='55970' title='55970'>Come along!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55971' title='55971'>We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. </span>
<span sid='55972' title='55972'>It was a pokey, little, shabbygenteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. </span>
<span sid='55973' title='55973'>Three gilt balls and a brown board with 'JABEZ WILSON' in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business. </span>
<span sid='55974' title='55974'>Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. </span>
<span sid='55975' title='55975'>Then he walked slowly up the street and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. </span>
<span sid='55976' title='55976'>Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. </span>
<span sid='55977' title='55977'>It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, cleanshaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55978' title='55978'>'Thank you,' said Holmes, 'I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Strand&t=h'>the Strand</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55979' title='55979'>'Third right, fourth left,' answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55980' title='55980'>'Smart fellow, that,' observed Holmes as we walked away. </span>
<span sid='55981' title='55981'>'He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. </span>
<span sid='55982' title='55982'>I have known something of him before.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55983' title='55983'>'Evidently,' said I, 'Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. </span>
<span sid='55984' title='55984'>I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55985' title='55985'>'Not him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55986' title='55986'>'What then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55987' title='55987'>'The knees of his trousers.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55988' title='55988'>'And what did you see?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55989' title='55989'>'What I expected to see.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55990' title='55990'>'Why did you beat the pavement?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55991' title='55991'>'My dear Doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. </span>
<span sid='55992' title='55992'>We are spies in an enemy's country. </span>
<span sid='55993' title='55993'>We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square. </span>
<span sid='55994' title='55994'>Let us now explore the paths which lie behind it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='55995' title='55995'>The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. </span>
<span sid='55996' title='55996'>It was one of the main arteries which convey the traffic of the City to the north and west. </span>
<span sid='55997' title='55997'>The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inwards and outwards, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. </span>
<span sid='55998' title='55998'>It was difficult to realize as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.</span>
<p>
<span sid='55999' title='55999'>'Let me see,' said Holmes, standing at the corner, and glancing along the line, 'I should like just to remember the order of the houses here. </span>
<span sid='56000' title='56000'>It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='56001' title='56001'>There is Mortimer's, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building depôt. </span>
<span sid='56002' title='56002'>That carries us right on to the other block. </span>
<span sid='56003' title='56003'>And now, Doctor, we've done our work, so it's time we had some play. </span>
<span sid='56004' title='56004'>A sandwich, and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin land, where all is sweetness, and delicacy, and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56005' title='56005'>My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer, but a composer of no ordinary merit. </span>
<span sid='56006' title='56006'>All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. </span>
<span sid='56007' title='56007'>In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him. </span>
<span sid='56008' title='56008'>The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his arm-chair amid his improvisations and his blackletter editions. </span>
<span sid='56009' title='56009'>Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. </span>
<span sid='56010' title='56010'>When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=St. James's Hall&t=h'>St. James's Hall</a> I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56011' title='56011'>'You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,' he remarked, as we emerged.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56012' title='56012'>'Yes, it would be as well.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56013' title='56013'>'And I have some business to do which will take some hours. </span>
<span sid='56014' title='56014'>This business at Coburg Square is serious.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56015' title='56015'>'Why serious?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56016' title='56016'>'A considerable crime is in contemplation. </span>
<span sid='56017' title='56017'>I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. </span>
<span sid='56018' title='56018'>But to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters. </span>
<span sid='56019' title='56019'>I shall want your help to-night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56020' title='56020'>'At what time?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56021' title='56021'>'Ten will be early enough.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56022' title='56022'>'I shall be at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> at ten.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56023' title='56023'>'Very well. </span>
<span sid='56024' title='56024'>And, I say, Doctor! </span>
<span sid='56025' title='56025'>There may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.' </span>
<span sid='56026' title='56026'>He waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56027' title='56027'>I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='56028' title='56028'>Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened, but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. </span>
<span sid='56029' title='56029'>As I drove home to my house in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kensington&t=h'>Kensington</a> I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopædia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. </span>
<span sid='56030' title='56030'>What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? </span>
<span sid='56031' title='56031'>Where were we going, and what were we to do? </span>
<span sid='56032' title='56032'>I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable man - a man who might play a deep game. </span>
<span sid='56033' title='56033'>I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair, and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56034' title='56034'>It was a quarter past nine when I started from home and made my way across the Park, and so through <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Oxford Street&t=h'>Oxford Street</a> to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='56035' title='56035'>Two hansoms were standing at the door, and, as I entered the passage, I heard the sound of voices from above. </span>
<span sid='56036' title='56036'>On entering his room, I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognized as Peter Jones, the official police agent; while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56037' title='56037'>'Ha! our party is complete,' said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket, and taking his heavy huntingcrop from the rack. </span>
<span sid='56038' title='56038'>'Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>? </span>
<span sid='56039' title='56039'>Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night's adventure.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56040' title='56040'>'We're hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,' said Jones in his consequential way. </span>
<span sid='56041' title='56041'>'Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase. </span>
<span sid='56042' title='56042'>All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56043' title='56043'>'I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,' observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56044' title='56044'>'You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,' said the police agent loftily. </span>
<span sid='56045' title='56045'>'He has his own little methods, which are, if he won't mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. </span>
<span sid='56046' title='56046'>It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Agra&t=h'>Agra</a> treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56047' title='56047'>'Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right!' said the stranger, with deference. </span>
<span sid='56048' title='56048'>'Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. </span>
<span sid='56049' title='56049'>It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56050' title='56050'>'I think you will find,' said Sherlock Holmes, 'that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. </span>
<span sid='56051' title='56051'>For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be some thirty thousand pounds; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56052' title='56052'>'John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. </span>
<span sid='56053' title='56053'>He's a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='56054' title='56054'>He's a remarkable man, is young John Clay. </span>
<span sid='56055' title='56055'>His grandfather was a Royal Duke, and he himself has been to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Eton&t=h'>Eton</a> and Oxford. </span>
<span sid='56056' title='56056'>His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself. </span>
<span sid='56057' title='56057'>He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Cornwall&t=h'>Cornwall</a> the next. </span>
<span sid='56058' title='56058'>I've been on his track for years, and have never set eyes on him yet.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56059' title='56059'>'I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. </span>
<span sid='56060' title='56060'>I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. </span>
<span sid='56061' title='56061'>It is past ten, however, and quite time that we started. </span>
<span sid='56062' title='56062'>If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56063' title='56063'>Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive, and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. </span>
<span sid='56064' title='56064'>We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Farringdon Street&t=h'>Farringdon Street</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56065' title='56065'>'We are close there now,' my friend remarked. </span>
<span sid='56066' title='56066'>'This fellow Merryweather is a bank director and personally interested in the matter. </span>
<span sid='56067' title='56067'>I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. </span>
<span sid='56068' title='56068'>He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. </span>
<span sid='56069' title='56069'>He has one positive virtue. </span>
<span sid='56070' title='56070'>He is as brave as a bulldog, and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. </span>
<span sid='56071' title='56071'>Here we are, and they are waiting for us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56072' title='56072'>We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. </span>
<span sid='56073' title='56073'>Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage, and through a side door, which he opened for us. </span>
<span sid='56074' title='56074'>Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. </span>
<span sid='56075' title='56075'>This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. </span>
<span sid='56076' title='56076'>Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56077' title='56077'>'You are not very vulnerable from above,' Holmes remarked, as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56078' title='56078'>'Nor from below,' said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. </span>
<span sid='56079' title='56079'>'Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!' he remarked, looking up in surprise.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56080' title='56080'>'I must really ask you to be a little more quiet,' said Holmes severely. </span>
<span sid='56081' title='56081'>'You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. </span>
<span sid='56082' title='56082'>Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56083' title='56083'>The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor, and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. </span>
<span sid='56084' title='56084'>A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again, and put his glass in his pocket.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56085' title='56085'>'We have at least an hour before us,' he remarked, 'for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. </span>
<span sid='56086' title='56086'>Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. </span>
<span sid='56087' title='56087'>We are at present, Doctor - as no doubt you have divined - in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> banks. </span>
<span sid='56088' title='56088'>Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56089' title='56089'>'It is our French gold,' whispered the director. </span>
<span sid='56090' title='56090'>'We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56091' title='56091'>'Your French gold?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56092' title='56092'>'Yes. </span>
<span sid='56093' title='56093'>We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources, and borrowed, for that purpose, thirty thousand napoleons from the Bank of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>. </span>
<span sid='56094' title='56094'>It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. </span>
<span sid='56095' title='56095'>The crate upon which I sit contains two thousand napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. </span>
<span sid='56096' title='56096'>Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56097' title='56097'>'Which were very well justified,' observed Holmes. </span>
<span sid='56098' title='56098'>'And now it is time that we arranged our little plans. </span>
<span sid='56099' title='56099'>I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. </span>
<span sid='56100' title='56100'>In the meantime, Mr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56101' title='56101'>'And sit in the dark?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56102' title='56102'>'I am afraid so. </span>
<span sid='56103' title='56103'>I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a partie carrée, you might have your rubber after all. </span>
<span sid='56104' title='56104'>But I see that the enemy's preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. </span>
<span sid='56105' title='56105'>And, first of all, we must choose our positions. </span>
<span sid='56106' title='56106'>These are daring men, and, though we shall take them at a disadvantage they may do us some harm, unless we are careful. </span>
<span sid='56107' title='56107'>I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourself behind those. </span>
<span sid='56108' title='56108'>Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. </span>
<span sid='56109' title='56109'>If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56110' title='56110'>I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched. </span>
<span sid='56111' title='56111'>Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern, and left us in pitch darkness - such an absolute darkness as I have never before experienced. </span>
<span sid='56112' title='56112'>The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment's notice. </span>
<span sid='56113' title='56113'>To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there  was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold, dank air of the vault.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56114' title='56114'>'They have but one retreat,' whispered Holmes. </span>
<span sid='56115' title='56115'>'That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. </span>
<span sid='56116' title='56116'>I hope that you have done what I asked you, Jones?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56117' title='56117'>'I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56118' title='56118'>'Then we have stopped all the holes. </span>
<span sid='56119' title='56119'>And now we must be silent and wait.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56120' title='56120'>What a time it seemed! </span>
<span sid='56121' title='56121'>From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. </span>
<span sid='56122' title='56122'>My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position, yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin sighing note of the bank director. </span>
<span sid='56123' title='56123'>From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor. </span>
<span sid='56124' title='56124'>Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56125' title='56125'>At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. </span>
<span sid='56126' title='56126'>Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light. </span>
<span sid='56127' title='56127'>For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. </span>
<span sid='56128' title='56128'>Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark, which marked a chink between the stones.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56129' title='56129'>Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. </span>
<span sid='56130' title='56130'>With a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side, and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. </span>
<span sid='56131' title='56131'>Over the edge there peeped a cleancut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder high and waist high, until one knee rested upon the edge. </span>
<span sid='56132' title='56132'>In another instant he stood at the side of the hole, and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56133' title='56133'>'It's all clear,' he whispered. </span>
<span sid='56134' title='56134'>'Have you the chisel, and the bags. </span>
<span sid='56135' title='56135'>Great Scott! </span>
<span sid='56136' title='56136'>Jump, Archie, jump, and I'll swing for it!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56137' title='56137'>Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. </span>
<span sid='56138' title='56138'>The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. </span>
<span sid='56139' title='56139'>The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes's hunting-crop came down on the man's wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56140' title='56140'>'It's no use, John Clay,' said Holmes blandly; 'you have no chance at all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56141' title='56141'>'So I see,' the other answered with the utmost coolness. </span>
<span sid='56142' title='56142'>'I fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56143' title='56143'>'There are three men waiting for him at the door,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56144' title='56144'>'Oh, indeed. </span>
<span sid='56145' title='56145'>You seem to have done the thing very completely. </span>
<span sid='56146' title='56146'>I must compliment you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56147' title='56147'>'And I you,' Holmes answered. </span>
<span sid='56148' title='56148'>'Your red-headed idea was very new and effective.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56149' title='56149'>'You'll see your pal again presently,' said Jones. </span>
<span sid='56150' title='56150'>'He's quicker at climbing down holes than I am. </span>
<span sid='56151' title='56151'>Just hold out while I fix the derbies.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56152' title='56152'>'I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,' remarked our prisoner, as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. </span>
<span sid='56153' title='56153'>'You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. </span>
<span sid='56154' title='56154'>Have the goodness also when you address me always to say "sir" and "please".'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56155' title='56155'>'All right,' said Jones, with a stare and a snigger. </span>
<span sid='56156' title='56156'>'Well, would you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your highness to the police station.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56157' title='56157'>'That is better,' said John Clay serenely. </span>
<span sid='56158' title='56158'>He made a sweeping bow to the three of us, and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56159' title='56159'>'Really, Mr. Holmes,' said Mr. Merryweather, as we followed them from the cellar, 'I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. </span>
<span sid='56160' title='56160'>There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56161' title='56161'>'I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John Clay,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='56162' title='56162'>'I have been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56163' title='56163'>'You see, Watson,' he explained in the early hours of the morning, as we sat over a glass of whisky-and-soda in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>, 'it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the Encyclopaedia, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. </span>
<span sid='56164' title='56164'>It was a curious way of managing it, but really it would be difficult to suggest a better. </span>
<span sid='56165' title='56165'>The method was no doubt suggested to Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice's hair. </span>
<span sid='56166' title='56166'>The four pounds a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? </span>
<span sid='56167' title='56167'>They put in the advertisement; one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. </span>
<span sid='56168' title='56168'>From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half-wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56169' title='56169'>'But how could you guess what the motive was?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56170' title='56170'>'Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. </span>
<span sid='56171' title='56171'>That, however, was out of the question. </span>
<span sid='56172' title='56172'>The man's business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations and such an expenditure as they were at. </span>
<span sid='56173' title='56173'>It must then be something out of the house. </span>
<span sid='56174' title='56174'>What could it be? </span>
<span sid='56175' title='56175'>I thought of the assistant's fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. </span>
<span sid='56176' title='56176'>The cellar! </span>
<span sid='56177' title='56177'>There was the end of this tangled clue. </span>
<span sid='56178' title='56178'>Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant, and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='56179' title='56179'>He was doing something in the cellar - something which took many hours a day for months on end. </span>
<span sid='56180' title='56180'>What could it be, once more? </span>
<span sid='56181' title='56181'>I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56182' title='56182'>'So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. </span>
<span sid='56183' title='56183'>I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. </span>
<span sid='56184' title='56184'>I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. </span>
<span sid='56185' title='56185'>It was not in front. </span>
<span sid='56186' title='56186'>Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. </span>
<span sid='56187' title='56187'>We have had some skirmishes, but we  had never set eyes on each other before. </span>
<span sid='56188' title='56188'>I hardly looked at his face. </span>
<span sid='56189' title='56189'>His knees were what I wished to see. </span>
<span sid='56190' title='56190'>You must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled and stained they were. </span>
<span sid='56191' title='56191'>They spoke of those hours of burrowing. </span>
<span sid='56192' title='56192'>The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. </span>
<span sid='56193' title='56193'>I walked round the corner, saw that the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. </span>
<span sid='56194' title='56194'>When you drove home after the concert I called upon <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>, and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56195' title='56195'>'And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56196' title='56196'>'Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence; in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. </span>
<span sid='56197' title='56197'>But it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. </span>
<span sid='56198' title='56198'>Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. </span>
<span sid='56199' title='56199'>For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56200' title='56200'>'You reasoned it out beautifully,' I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. </span>
<span sid='56201' title='56201'>'It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56202' title='56202'>'It saved me from ennui,' he answered, yawning. </span>
<span sid='56203' title='56203'>'Alas, I already feel it closing in upon me! </span>
<span sid='56204' title='56204'>My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. </span>
<span sid='56205' title='56205'>These little problems help me to do so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56206' title='56206'>'And you are a benefactor of the race,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56207' title='56207'>He shrugged his shoulders. </span>
<span sid='56208' title='56208'>'Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use,' he remarked. </span>
<span sid='56209' title='56209'>'"L'homme c'est rien - l'oeuvre c'est tout," as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand.'</span>
