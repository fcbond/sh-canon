<p>
<span sid='39357' title='39357'>'But why Turkish?' asked Mr Sherlock Holmes, gazing fixedly at my boots. </span>
<span sid='39358' title='39358'>I was reclining in a cane-backed chair at the moment, and my protruded feet had attracted his ever-active attention.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39359' title='39359'>'English,' I answered, in some surprise. </span>
<span sid='39360' title='39360'>'I got them at Latimer's, in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Oxford Street&t=h'>Oxford Street</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39361' title='39361'>Holmes smiled with an expression of weary patience.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39362' title='39362'>'The bath!' he said, 'the bath! </span>
<span sid='39363' title='39363'>Why the relaxing and expensive Turkish rather than the invigorating home-made article?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39364' title='39364'>'Because for the last few days I have been feeling rheumatic and old. </span>
<span sid='39365' title='39365'>A Turkish bath is what we call an alterative in medicine - a fresh starting-point, a cleanser of the system.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39366' title='39366'>'By the way, Holmes,' I added, 'I have no doubt the connection between my boots and a Turkish bath is a perfectly self-evident one to a logical mind, and yet I should be obliged to you if you would indicate it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39367' title='39367'>'The train of reasoning is not very obscure, Watson,' said Holmes, with a mischievous twinkle. </span>
<span sid='39368' title='39368'>'It belongs to the same elementary class of deduction which I should illustrate if I were to ask you who shared your cab in your drive this morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39369' title='39369'>'I don't admit that a fresh illustration is an explanation,' said I, with some asperity.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39370' title='39370'>'Bravo, Watson! </span>
<span sid='39371' title='39371'>A very dignified and logical remonstrance. </span>
<span sid='39372' title='39372'>Let me see, what were the points? </span>
<span sid='39373' title='39373'>Take the last one first - the cab. </span>
<span sid='39374' title='39374'>You observe that you have some splashes on the left sleeve and shoulder of your coat. </span>
<span sid='39375' title='39375'>Had you sat in the centre of a hansom you would probably have had no splashes, and if you had they would certainly have been symmetrical. </span>
<span sid='39376' title='39376'>Therefore it is clear that you sat at the side. </span>
<span sid='39377' title='39377'>Therefore it is equally clear that you had a companion.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39378' title='39378'>'Absurdly commonplace, is it not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39379' title='39379'>'But the boots and the bath?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39380' title='39380'>'Equally childish. </span>
<span sid='39381' title='39381'>You are in the habit of doing up your boots in a certain way. </span>
<span sid='39382' title='39382'>I see them on this occasion fastened with an elaborate double bow, which is not your usual method of tying them. </span>
<span sid='39383' title='39383'>You have, therefore, had them off. </span>
<span sid='39384' title='39384'>Who has tied them? </span>
<span sid='39385' title='39385'>A bootmaker - or the boy at the bath. </span>
<span sid='39386' title='39386'>It is unlikely that it is the bootmaker, since your boots are nearly new. </span>
<span sid='39387' title='39387'>Well, what remains? </span>
<span sid='39388' title='39388'>The bath. </span>
<span sid='39389' title='39389'>Absurd, is it not? </span>
<span sid='39390' title='39390'>But, for all that, the Turkish bath has served a purpose.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39391' title='39391'>'What is that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39392' title='39392'>'You say that you have had it because you need a change. </span>
<span sid='39393' title='39393'>Let me suggest that you take one. </span>
<span sid='39394' title='39394'>How would Lausanne do, my dear Watson - first-class tickets and all expenses paid on a princely scale?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39395' title='39395'>'Splendid! </span>
<span sid='39396' title='39396'>But why?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39397' title='39397'>Holmes leaned back in his armchair and took his notebook from his pocket.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39398' title='39398'>'One of the most dangerous classes in the world,' said he, 'is the drifting and friendless woman. </span>
<span sid='39399' title='39399'>She is the most harmless, and often the most useful of mortals, but she is the inevitable inciter of crime in others. </span>
<span sid='39400' title='39400'>She is helpless. </span>
<span sid='39401' title='39401'>She is migratory. </span>
<span sid='39402' title='39402'>She has sufficient means to take her from country to country and from hotel to hotel. </span>
<span sid='39403' title='39403'>She is lost, as often as not, in a maze of obscure pensions and boarding-houses. </span>
<span sid='39404' title='39404'>She is a stray chicken in a world of foxes. </span>
<span sid='39405' title='39405'>When she is gobbled up she is hardly missed. </span>
<span sid='39406' title='39406'>I much fear that some evil has come to the Lady <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>s Carfax.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39407' title='39407'>I was relieved at this sudden descent from the general to the particular. </span>
<span sid='39408' title='39408'>Holmes consulted his notes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39409' title='39409'>'Lady <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>s,' he continued, 'is the sole survivor of the direct family of the late Earl of Rufton. </span>
<span sid='39410' title='39410'>The estates went, as you may remember, in the male line. </span>
<span sid='39411' title='39411'>She was left with limited means, but with some very remarkable old Spanish jewellery of silver and curiously-cut diamonds to which she was fondly attached - too attached, for she refused to leave them with her banker and always carried them about with her. </span>
<span sid='39412' title='39412'>A rather pathetic figure, the Lady <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>s, a beautiful woman, still in fresh middle age, and yet, by a strange chance, the last derelict of what only twenty years ago was a goodly fleet.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39413' title='39413'>'What has happened to her, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39414' title='39414'>'Ah, what has happened to the Lady <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>s? </span>
<span sid='39415' title='39415'>Is she alive or dead? </span>
<span sid='39416' title='39416'>There is our problem. </span>
<span sid='39417' title='39417'>She is a lady of precise habits, and for four years it has been her invariable custom to write every second week to Miss Dobney, her old governess, who has long retired, and lives in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Camberwell&t=h'>Camberwell</a>. </span>
<span sid='39418' title='39418'>It is this Miss Dobney who consulted me. </span>
<span sid='39419' title='39419'>Nearly five weeks have passed without a word. </span>
<span sid='39420' title='39420'>The last letter was from the Hôtel National at Lausanne. </span>
<span sid='39421' title='39421'>Lady <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>s seems to have left there and given no address. </span>
<span sid='39422' title='39422'>The family are anxious, and, as they are exceedingly wealthy, no sum will be spared if we can clear the matter up.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39423' title='39423'>'Is Miss Dobney the only source of information? </span>
<span sid='39424' title='39424'>Surely she had other correspondents?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39425' title='39425'>'There is one correspondent who is a sure draw, Watson. </span>
<span sid='39426' title='39426'>That is the bank. </span>
<span sid='39427' title='39427'>Single ladies must live, and their passbooks are compressed diaries. </span>
<span sid='39428' title='39428'>She banks at Silvester's. </span>
<span sid='39429' title='39429'>I have glanced over her account. </span>
<span sid='39430' title='39430'>The last cheque but one paid her bill at Lausanne, but it was a large one and probably left her with cash in hand. </span>
<span sid='39431' title='39431'>Only one cheque has been drawn since.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39432' title='39432'>'To whom, and where?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39433' title='39433'>'To Miss Marie Devine. </span>
<span sid='39434' title='39434'>There is nothing to show where the cheque was drawn. </span>
<span sid='39435' title='39435'>It was cashed at the Crédit Lyonnais at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Montpellier&t=h'>Montpellier</a> less than three weeks ago. </span>
<span sid='39436' title='39436'>The sum was fifty pounds.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39437' title='39437'>'And who is Miss Marie Devine?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39438' title='39438'>'That also I have been able to discover. </span>
<span sid='39439' title='39439'>Miss Marie Devine was the maid of lady <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>s Carfax. </span>
<span sid='39440' title='39440'>Why she should have paid her this cheque we have not yet determined. </span>
<span sid='39441' title='39441'>I have no doubt, however, that your researches win soon clear the matter up."</span>
<p>
<span sid='39442' title='39442'>'My researches!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39443' title='39443'>'Hence the health-giving expedition to Lausanne. </span>
<span sid='39444' title='39444'>You know that I cannot possibly leave <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> while old Abrahams is in such mortal terror of his life. </span>
<span sid='39445' title='39445'>Besides, on general principles it is best that I should not leave the country. </span>
<span sid='39446' title='39446'><a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a> feels lonely without me, and it causes an unhealthy excitement among the criminal classes. </span>
<span sid='39447' title='39447'>Go, then, my dear Watson, and if my humble counsel can ever be valued at so extravagant a rate as twopence a word, it waits your disposal night and day at the end of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Continent&t=h'>the Continent</a>al wire.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39448' title='39448'>Two days later found me at the National Hotel at Lausanne, where I received every courtesy at the hands of M. </span>
<span sid='39449' title='39449'>Moser, the well-known manager. </span>
<span sid='39450' title='39450'>Lady <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>s, as he informed me, had stayed there for several weeks. </span>
<span sid='39451' title='39451'>She had been much liked by all who met her. </span>
<span sid='39452' title='39452'>Her age was not more than forty. </span>
<span sid='39453' title='39453'>She was still handsome, and bore every sign of having in her youth been a very lovely woman. </span>
<span sid='39454' title='39454'>M. Moser knew nothing of any valuable jewellery, but it had been remarked by the servants that the heavy trunk in the lady's bedroom was always scrupulously locked. </span>
<span sid='39455' title='39455'>Marie Devine, the maid, was as popular as her mistress. </span>
<span sid='39456' title='39456'>She was actually engaged to one of the head waiters in the hotel, and there was no difficulty in getting her address. </span>
<span sid='39457' title='39457'>It was 11, Rue de Trajan, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Montpellier&t=h'>Montpellier</a>. </span>
<span sid='39458' title='39458'>All this I jotted down, and felt that Holmes himself could not have been more adroit in collecting his facts.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39459' title='39459'>Only one corner still remained in the shadow. </span>
<span sid='39460' title='39460'>No light which I possessed could clear up the cause for the lady's sudden departure. </span>
<span sid='39461' title='39461'>She was very happy at Lausanne. </span>
<span sid='39462' title='39462'>There was every reason to believe that she intended to remain for the season in her luxurious rooms overlooking the lake. </span>
<span sid='39463' title='39463'>And yet she had left at a single day's notice, which involved her in the useless payment of a week's rent. </span>
<span sid='39464' title='39464'>Only Jules Vibart, the lover of the maid, had any suggestion to offer. </span>
<span sid='39465' title='39465'>He connected the sudden departure with the visit to the hotel a day or two before of a tall, dark, bearded man. </span>
<span sid='39466' title='39466'>'Un sauvage - un véritable sauvage! cried Jules Vibart. </span>
<span sid='39467' title='39467'>The man had rooms somewhere in the town. </span>
<span sid='39468' title='39468'>He had been seen talking earnestly to madame on the promenade by the lake. </span>
<span sid='39469' title='39469'>Then he had called. </span>
<span sid='39470' title='39470'>She had refused to see him. </span>
<span sid='39471' title='39471'>He was English, but of his name there was no record. </span>
<span sid='39472' title='39472'>Madame had left the place immediately afterwards. </span>
<span sid='39473' title='39473'>Jules Vibart, and, what was of more importance, Jules Vibart's sweetheart, thought that this call and this departure were cause and effect. </span>
<span sid='39474' title='39474'>Only one thing Jules could not discuss. </span>
<span sid='39475' title='39475'>That was the reason why Marie had left her mistress. </span>
<span sid='39476' title='39476'>Of that he could or would say nothing. </span>
<span sid='39477' title='39477'>If I wished to know, I must go to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Montpellier&t=h'>Montpellier</a> and ask her.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39478' title='39478'>So ended the first chapter of my inquiry. </span>
<span sid='39479' title='39479'>The second was devoted to the place which Lady <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>s Carfax had sought when she left Lausanne. </span>
<span sid='39480' title='39480'>Concerning this there had been some secrecy, which confirmed the idea that she had gone with the intention of throwing someone off her track. </span>
<span sid='39481' title='39481'>Otherwise why should not her luggage have been openly labelled for Baden? </span>
<span sid='39482' title='39482'>Both she and it reached the Rhenish spa by some circuitous route. </span>
<span sid='39483' title='39483'>Thus much I gathered from the manager of Cook's local office. </span>
<span sid='39484' title='39484'>So to Baden I went, after dispatching to Holmes an account of all my proceedings, and receiving in reply a telegram of half-humorous commendation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39485' title='39485'>At Baden the track was not difficult to follow. </span>
<span sid='39486' title='39486'>Lady <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>s had stayed at the Englischer Hof for a fortnight. </span>
<span sid='39487' title='39487'>Whilst there she had made the acquaintance of a Dr Shlessinger and his wife, a missionary from South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>. </span>
<span sid='39488' title='39488'>Like most lonely ladies, lady <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>s found her comfort and occupation in religion. </span>
<span sid='39489' title='39489'>Dr Shlessinger's remarkable personality, his whole-hearted devotion, and the fact that he was recovering from a disease contracted in the exercise of his apostolic duties, affected her deeply. </span>
<span sid='39490' title='39490'>She had helped Mrs Shlessinger in the nursing of the convalescent saint. </span>
<span sid='39491' title='39491'>He spent his day, as the manager described it to me, upon a lounge-chair on the veranda, with an attendant lady upon either side of him. </span>
<span sid='39492' title='39492'>He was preparing a map of the Holy land, with special reference to the kingdom of the Midianites, upon which he was writing a monograph. </span>
<span sid='39493' title='39493'>Finally, having improved much in health, he and his wife had returned to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, and Lady <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>s had started thither in their company. </span>
<span sid='39494' title='39494'>This was just three weeks before, and the manager had heard nothing since. </span>
<span sid='39495' title='39495'>As to the maid, Marie, she had gone off some days beforehand in floods of tears, after informing the other maids that she was leaving service for ever. </span>
<span sid='39496' title='39496'>Dr Shlessinger had paid the bill of the whole party before his departure.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39497' title='39497'>'By the way,' said the landlord, in conclusion, 'you are not the only friend of Lady <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>s Carfax who is inquiring after her just now. </span>
<span sid='39498' title='39498'>Only a week or so ago we had a man here upon the same errand.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39499' title='39499'>'Did he give a name?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39500' title='39500'>'None, but he was an Englishman, though of an unusual type.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39501' title='39501'>'A savage?' said I, linking my facts after the fashion of my illustrious friend.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39502' title='39502'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='39503' title='39503'>That describes him very well. </span>
<span sid='39504' title='39504'>He is a bulky, bearded, sunburned fellow, who looks as if he would be more at home in a farmers' inn than in a fashionable hotel. </span>
<span sid='39505' title='39505'>A hard, fierce man, I should think, and one whom I should be sorry to offend.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39506' title='39506'>Already the mystery began to define itself, as figures grow clearer with the lifting of a fog. </span>
<span sid='39507' title='39507'>Here was this good and pious lady pursued from place to place by a sinister and unrelenting figure. </span>
<span sid='39508' title='39508'>She feared him, or she would not have fled from Lausanne. </span>
<span sid='39509' title='39509'>He had still followed. </span>
<span sid='39510' title='39510'>Sooner or later he would overtake her. </span>
<span sid='39511' title='39511'>Had he already overtaken her? </span>
<span sid='39512' title='39512'>Was that the secret of her continued silence? </span>
<span sid='39513' title='39513'>Could the good people who were her companions not screen her from his violence or his blackmail? </span>
<span sid='39514' title='39514'>What horrible purpose, what deep design, lay behind this long pursuit? </span>
<span sid='39515' title='39515'>There was the problem which I had to solve.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39516' title='39516'>To Holmes I wrote showing how rapidly and surely I had got down to the roots of the matter. </span>
<span sid='39517' title='39517'>In reply I had a telegram asking for a description of Dr Shlessinger's left ear. </span>
<span sid='39518' title='39518'>Holmes's ideas of humour are strange and occasionally offensive, so I took no notice of his ill-timed jest - indeed, I had already reached <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Montpellier&t=h'>Montpellier</a> in my pursuit of the maid, Marie, before his message came.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39519' title='39519'>I had no difficulty in finding the ex-servant and in learning all that she could tell me. </span>
<span sid='39520' title='39520'>She was a devoted creature, who had only left her mistress because she was sure that she was in good hands, and because her own approaching marriage made a separation inevitable in any case. </span>
<span sid='39521' title='39521'>Her mistress had, as she confessed with distress, shown some irritability of temper towards her during their stay in Baden, and had even questioned her once as if she had suspicions of her honesty, and this had made the parting easier than it would otherwise have been. </span>
<span sid='39522' title='39522'>Lady <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>s had given her fifty pounds as a wedding-present. </span>
<span sid='39523' title='39523'>Like me, Marie viewed with deep distrust the stranger who had driven her mistress from Lausanne. </span>
<span sid='39524' title='39524'>With her own eyes she had seen him seize the lady's wrist with great violence on the public promenade by the lake. </span>
<span sid='39525' title='39525'>He was a fierce and terrible man. </span>
<span sid='39526' title='39526'>She believed that it was out of dread of him that Lady <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>s had accepted the escort of the Shlessingers to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='39527' title='39527'>She had never spoken to Marie about it, but many little signs had convinced the maid that her mistress lived in a state of continual nervous apprehension. </span>
<span sid='39528' title='39528'>So far she had got in her narrative, when suddenly she sprang from her chair and her face was convulsed with surprise and fear. </span>
<span sid='39529' title='39529'>'See!' she cried. </span>
<span sid='39530' title='39530'>'The miscreant follows still! </span>
<span sid='39531' title='39531'>There is the very man of whom I speak.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39532' title='39532'>Through the open sitting-room window I saw a huge, swarthy man with a bristling black beard walking slowly down the centre of the street and staring eagerly at the numbers of the houses. </span>
<span sid='39533' title='39533'>It was clear that, like myself, he was on the track of the maid. </span>
<span sid='39534' title='39534'>Acting upon the impulse of the moment, I rushed out and accosted him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39535' title='39535'>'You are an Englishman,' I said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39536' title='39536'>'What if I am?' he asked, with a most villainous scowl.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39537' title='39537'>'May I ask what your name is?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39538' title='39538'>'No, you may not,' said he, with decision.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39539' title='39539'>The situation was awkward, but the most direct way is often the best.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39540' title='39540'>'Where is the lady <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>s Carfax?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39541' title='39541'>He stared at me in amazement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39542' title='39542'>'What have you done with her? </span>
<span sid='39543' title='39543'>Why have you pursued her? </span>
<span sid='39544' title='39544'>I insist upon an answer!' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39545' title='39545'>The fellow gave a bellow of anger and sprang upon me like a tiger. </span>
<span sid='39546' title='39546'>I have held my own in many a struggle, but the man had a grip of iron and the fury of a fiend. </span>
<span sid='39547' title='39547'>His hand was on my throat and my senses were nearly gone before an unshaven French ouvrier, in a blue blouse, darted out from a cabaret opposite, with a cudgel in his hand, and struck my assailant a sharp crack over the forearm, which made him leave go his hold. </span>
<span sid='39548' title='39548'>He stood for an instant fuming with rage and uncertain whether he should not renew his attack. </span>
<span sid='39549' title='39549'>Then, with a snarl of anger, he left me and entered the cottage from which I had just come. </span>
<span sid='39550' title='39550'>I turned to thank my preserver, who stood beside me in the roadway.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39551' title='39551'>'Well, Watson,' said he, 'a very pretty hash you have made of it! </span>
<span sid='39552' title='39552'>I rather think you had better come back with me to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> by the night express.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39553' title='39553'>An hour afterwards Sherlock Holmes, in his usual garb and style, was seated in my private room at the hotel. </span>
<span sid='39554' title='39554'>His explanation of his sudden and opportune appearance was simplicity itself, for, finding that he could get away from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, he determined to head me off at the next obvious point of my travels. </span>
<span sid='39555' title='39555'>In the disguise of a working-man he had sat in the cabaret waiting for my appearance.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39556' title='39556'>'And a singularly consistent investigation you have made, my dear Watson,' said he. </span>
<span sid='39557' title='39557'>'I cannot at the moment recall any possible blunder which you have omitted. </span>
<span sid='39558' title='39558'>The total effect of your proceedings has been to give the alarm everywhere and yet to discover nothing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39559' title='39559'>'Perhaps you would have done no better,' I answered, bitterly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39560' title='39560'>'There is no "perhaps" about it. </span>
<span sid='39561' title='39561'>I have done better. </span>
<span sid='39562' title='39562'>Here is the Hon. </span>
<span sid='39563' title='39563'>Philip Green, who is a fellow-lodger with you in this hotel, and we may find in him the starting-point for a more successful investigation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39564' title='39564'>A card had come up on a salver, and it was followed by the same bearded ruffian who had attacked me in the street. </span>
<span sid='39565' title='39565'>He started when he saw me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39566' title='39566'>'What is this, Mr Holmes?' he asked. </span>
<span sid='39567' title='39567'>'I had your note and I have come. </span>
<span sid='39568' title='39568'>But what has this man to do with the matter?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39569' title='39569'>'This is my old friend and associate, Dr Watson, who is helping us in this affair.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39570' title='39570'>The stranger held out a huge, sunburned hand, with a few words of apology.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39571' title='39571'>'I hope I didn't harm you. </span>
<span sid='39572' title='39572'>When you accused me of hurting her I lost my grip of myself. </span>
<span sid='39573' title='39573'>Indeed, I'm not responsible in these days. </span>
<span sid='39574' title='39574'>My nerves are like five wires. </span>
<span sid='39575' title='39575'>But this situation is beyond me. </span>
<span sid='39576' title='39576'>What I want to know, in the first place, Mr Holmes, is, how in the world you came to hear of my existence at all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39577' title='39577'>'I am in touch with Miss Dobney, Lady <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>s's governess.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39578' title='39578'>'Old Susan Dobney with the mob cap! </span>
<span sid='39579' title='39579'>I remember her well.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39580' title='39580'>'And she remembers you. </span>
<span sid='39581' title='39581'>It was in the days before-before you found it better to go to South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39582' title='39582'>'Ah, I see you know my whole story. </span>
<span sid='39583' title='39583'>I need hide nothing from you. </span>
<span sid='39584' title='39584'>I swear to you, Mr Holmes, that there never was in this world a man who loved a woman with a more whole-hearted love than I had for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>s. </span>
<span sid='39585' title='39585'>I was a wild youngster, I know - not worse than others of my class. </span>
<span sid='39586' title='39586'>But her mind was pure as snow. </span>
<span sid='39587' title='39587'>She could not bear a shadow of coarseness. </span>
<span sid='39588' title='39588'>So, when she came to hear of things that I had done, she would have no more to say to me. </span>
<span sid='39589' title='39589'>And yet she loved me - that is the wonder of it! - loved me well enough to remain single all her sainted days just for my sake alone. </span>
<span sid='39590' title='39590'>When the years had passed and I had made my money at Barberton I thought perhaps I could seek her out and soften her. </span>
<span sid='39591' title='39591'>I had heard that she was still unmarried. </span>
<span sid='39592' title='39592'>I found her at Lausanne, and tried all I knew. </span>
<span sid='39593' title='39593'>She weakened, I think, but her will was strong, and when next I called she had left the town. </span>
<span sid='39594' title='39594'>I traced her to Baden, and then after a time heard that her maid was here. </span>
<span sid='39595' title='39595'>I'm a rough fellow, fresh from a rough life, and when Dr Watson spoke to me as he did I lost hold of myself for a moment. </span>
<span sid='39596' title='39596'>But for God's sake tell me what has become of the Lady <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>s.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39597' title='39597'>'That is for us to find out,' said Sherlock Holmes, with peculiar gravity. </span>
<span sid='39598' title='39598'>'What is your <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> address, Mr Green?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39599' title='39599'>'The <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Langham Hotel&t=h'>Langham Hotel</a> will find me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39600' title='39600'>'Then may I recommend that you return there and be on hand in case I should want you? </span>
<span sid='39601' title='39601'>I have no desire to encourage false hopes, but you may rest assured that all that can be done will be done for the safety of lady <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>s. </span>
<span sid='39602' title='39602'>I can say no more for the instant. </span>
<span sid='39603' title='39603'>I will leave you this card so that you may be able to keep in touch with us. </span>
<span sid='39604' title='39604'>Now, Watson, if you will pack your bag I will cable to Mrs Hudson to make one of her best efforts for two hungry travellers at seven-thirty tomorrow.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39605' title='39605'>A telegram was awaiting us when we reached our <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> rooms, which Holmes read with an exclamation of interest and threw across to me. </span>
<span sid='39606' title='39606'>'Jagged or torn,' was the message, and the place of origin Baden.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39607' title='39607'>'What is this?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39608' title='39608'>'It is everything,' Holmes answered. </span>
<span sid='39609' title='39609'>'You may remember my seemingly irrelevant question as to this clerical gentleman's left ear. </span>
<span sid='39610' title='39610'>You did not answer it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39611' title='39611'>'I had left Baden, and could not inquire.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39612' title='39612'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='39613' title='39613'>For this reason I sent a duplicate to the manager of the Englischer Hof, whose answer lies here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39614' title='39614'>'What does it show?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39615' title='39615'>'It shows, my dear Watson, that we are dealing with an exceptionally astute and dangerous man. </span>
<span sid='39616' title='39616'>The Rev. Dr Shlessinger, missionary from South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>, is none other than Holy Peters, one of the most unscrupulous rascals that <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Australia&t=h'>Australia</a> has ever evolved - and for a young country it has turned out some very finished types. </span>
<span sid='39617' title='39617'>His particular speciality is the beguiling of lonely ladies by playing upon their religious feelings, and his so-called wife, an Englishwoman named Fraser, is a worthy helpmate. </span>
<span sid='39618' title='39618'>The nature of his tactics suggested his identity to me, and this physical peculiarity - he was badly bitten in a saloon-fight at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Adelaide&t=h'>Adelaide</a> in '89 - confirmed my suspicion. </span>
<span sid='39619' title='39619'>This poor lady is in the hands of a most infernal couple, who will stick at nothing, Watson. </span>
<span sid='39620' title='39620'>That she is already dead is a very likely supposition. </span>
<span sid='39621' title='39621'>If not, she is undoubtedly in some sort of confinement, and unable to write to Miss Dobney or her other friends. </span>
<span sid='39622' title='39622'>It is always possible that she never reached <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, or that she has passed through it, but the former is improbable, as, with their system of registration, it is not easy for foreigners to play tricks with <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Continent&t=h'>the Continent</a>al police, and the latter is also unlikely, as these rogues could not hope to find any other place where it would be as easy to keep a person under restraint. </span>
<span sid='39623' title='39623'>All my instincts tell me that she is in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, but, as we have at present no possible means of telling where, we can only take the obvious steps, eat our dinner, and possess our souls in patience. </span>
<span sid='39624' title='39624'>Later in the evening I will stroll down and have a word with friend Lestrade at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39625' title='39625'>But neither the official police nor Holmes's own small, but very efficient, organization sufficed to clear away the mystery. </span>
<span sid='39626' title='39626'>Amid the crowded millions of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> the three persons we sought were as completely obliterated as if they had never lived. </span>
<span sid='39627' title='39627'>Advertisements were tried, and failed. </span>
<span sid='39628' title='39628'>Clues were followed, and led to nothing. </span>
<span sid='39629' title='39629'>Every criminal resort which Shlessinger might frequent was drawn in vain. </span>
<span sid='39630' title='39630'>His old associates were watched, but they kept clear of him. </span>
<span sid='39631' title='39631'>And then suddenly, after a week of helpless suspense, there came a flash of light. </span>
<span sid='39632' title='39632'>A silver-and-brilliant pendant of old Spanish design had been pawned at Bevington's, in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Westminster&t=h'>Westminster</a> Road. </span>
<span sid='39633' title='39633'>The pawner was a large, clean-shaven man of clerical appearance. </span>
<span sid='39634' title='39634'>His name and address were demonstrably false. </span>
<span sid='39635' title='39635'>The ear had escaped notice, but the description was surely that of Shlessinger.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39636' title='39636'>Three times had our bearded friend from the Langham called for news-the third time within an hour of this fresh development. </span>
<span sid='39637' title='39637'>His clothes were getting looser on his great body. </span>
<span sid='39638' title='39638'>He seemed to be wilting away in his anxiety. </span>
<span sid='39639' title='39639'>'If you will only give me something to do!' was his constant wail. </span>
<span sid='39640' title='39640'>At last Holmes could oblige him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39641' title='39641'>'He has begun to pawn the jewels. </span>
<span sid='39642' title='39642'>We should get him now.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39643' title='39643'>'But does this mean that any harm has befallen the Lady <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>s?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39644' title='39644'>Holmes shook his head very gravely.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39645' title='39645'>'Supposing that they have held her prisoner up to now, it is clear that they cannot let her loose without their own destruction. </span>
<span sid='39646' title='39646'>We must prepare for the worst.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39647' title='39647'>'What can I do?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39648' title='39648'>'These people do not know you by sight?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39649' title='39649'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39650' title='39650'>'It is possible that he will go to some other pawnbroker in the future. </span>
<span sid='39651' title='39651'>In that case, we must begin again. </span>
<span sid='39652' title='39652'>On the other hand, he has had a fair price and no questions asked, so if he is in need of ready money he will probably come back to Bevington's. </span>
<span sid='39653' title='39653'>I will give you a note to them, and they will let you wait in the shop. </span>
<span sid='39654' title='39654'>If the fellow comes you will follow him home. </span>
<span sid='39655' title='39655'>But no indiscretion, and, above all, no violence. </span>
<span sid='39656' title='39656'>I put you on your honour that you will take no step without my knowledge and consent.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39657' title='39657'>For two days the Hon. Philip Green (he was, I may mention, the son of the famous admiral of that name who commanded the Sea of Azof fleet in the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Crimea&t=h'>Crimea</a>n War) brought us no news. </span>
<span sid='39658' title='39658'>On the evening of the third he rushed into our sitting-room, pale, trembling, with every muscle of his powerful frame quivering with excitement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39659' title='39659'>'We have him! </span>
<span sid='39660' title='39660'>We have him!' he cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39661' title='39661'>He was incoherent in his agitation. </span>
<span sid='39662' title='39662'>Holmes soothed him with a few words, and thrust him into an arm-chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39663' title='39663'>'Come, now, give us the order of events,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39664' title='39664'>'She came only an hour ago. </span>
<span sid='39665' title='39665'>It was the wife, this time, but the pendant she brought was the fellow of the other. </span>
<span sid='39666' title='39666'>She is a tall, pale woman, with ferret eyes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39667' title='39667'>'That is the lady,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39668' title='39668'>'She left the office and I followed her. </span>
<span sid='39669' title='39669'>She walked up the Kennington Road, and I kept behind her. </span>
<span sid='39670' title='39670'>Presently she went into a shop. </span>
<span sid='39671' title='39671'>Mr Holmes, it was an undertaker's.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39672' title='39672'>My companion started. </span>
<span sid='39673' title='39673'>'Well?' he asked, in that vibrant voice which told of the fiery soul behind the cold, grey face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39674' title='39674'>'She was talking to the woman behind the counter. </span>
<span sid='39675' title='39675'>I entered as well. </span>
<span sid='39676' title='39676'>"It is late," I heard her say, or words to that effect. </span>
<span sid='39677' title='39677'>The woman was excusing herself. </span>
<span sid='39678' title='39678'>"It should be there before now," she answered. </span>
<span sid='39679' title='39679'>"It took longer, being out of the ordinary." </span>
<span sid='39680' title='39680'>They both stopped and looked at me, so I asked some question and then left the shop.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39681' title='39681'>'You did excellently well. </span>
<span sid='39682' title='39682'>What happened next?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39683' title='39683'>'The woman came out, but I had hid myself in a doorway. </span>
<span sid='39684' title='39684'>Her suspicions had been aroused, I think, for she looked round her. </span>
<span sid='39685' title='39685'>Then she called a cab and got in. </span>
<span sid='39686' title='39686'>I was lucky enough to get another and so to follow her. </span>
<span sid='39687' title='39687'>She got down at last at No. 36, Poultney Square, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a>. </span>
<span sid='39688' title='39688'>I drove past, left my cab at the corner of the square, and watched the house.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39689' title='39689'>'Did you see anyone?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39690' title='39690'>'The windows were all in darkness save one on the lower floor. </span>
<span sid='39691' title='39691'>The blind was down, and I could not see in. </span>
<span sid='39692' title='39692'>I was standing there, wondering what I should do next, when a covered van drove up with two men in it. </span>
<span sid='39693' title='39693'>They descended, took something out of the van, and carried it up the steps to the hall door. </span>
<span sid='39694' title='39694'>Mr Holmes, it was a coffin.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39695' title='39695'>'Ah!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39696' title='39696'>'For an instant I was on the point of rushing in. </span>
<span sid='39697' title='39697'>The door had been opened to admit the men and their burden. </span>
<span sid='39698' title='39698'>It was the woman who had opened it. </span>
<span sid='39699' title='39699'>But as I stood there she caught a glimpse of me, and I think that she recognized me. </span>
<span sid='39700' title='39700'>I saw her start, and she hastily closed the door. </span>
<span sid='39701' title='39701'>I remembered my promise to you, and here I am.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39702' title='39702'>'You have done excellent work,' said Holmes scribbling a few words upon a half-sheet of paper. </span>
<span sid='39703' title='39703'>'We can do nothing legal without a warrant, and you can serve the cause best by taking this note down to the authorities and getting one. </span>
<span sid='39704' title='39704'>There may be some difficulty, but I should think that the sale of the jewellery should be sufficient. </span>
<span sid='39705' title='39705'>Lestrade will see to all details.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39706' title='39706'>'But they may murder her in the meanwhile. </span>
<span sid='39707' title='39707'>What could the coffin mean, and for whom could it be but for her?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39708' title='39708'>'We will do all that can be done, Mr Green. </span>
<span sid='39709' title='39709'>Not a moment will be lost. </span>
<span sid='39710' title='39710'>Leave it in our hands. </span>
<span sid='39711' title='39711'>Now, Watson,' he added, as our client hurried away, 'he will set the regular forces on the move. </span>
<span sid='39712' title='39712'>We are, as usual, the irregulars, and we must take our own line of action. </span>
<span sid='39713' title='39713'>The situation strikes me as so desperate that the most extreme measures are justified. </span>
<span sid='39714' title='39714'>Not a moment is to be lost in getting to Poultney Square.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39715' title='39715'>'Let us try to reconstruct the situation,' said he, as we drove swiftly past the Houses of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Parliament&t=h'>Parliament</a> and over <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Westminster&t=h'>Westminster</a> Bridge. </span>
<span sid='39716' title='39716'>'These villains have coaxed this unhappy lady to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, after first alienating her from her faithful maid. </span>
<span sid='39717' title='39717'>If she has written any letters they have been intercepted. </span>
<span sid='39718' title='39718'>Through some confederate they have engaged a furnished house. </span>
<span sid='39719' title='39719'>Once inside it, they have made her a prisoner, and they have become possessed of the valuable jewellery which has been their object from the first. </span>
<span sid='39720' title='39720'>Already they have begun to sell part of it, which seems safe enough to them, since they have no reason to think that anyone is interested in the lady's fate. </span>
<span sid='39721' title='39721'>When she is released she will, of course, denounce them. </span>
<span sid='39722' title='39722'>Therefore, she must not be released. </span>
<span sid='39723' title='39723'>But they cannot keep her under lock and key for ever. </span>
<span sid='39724' title='39724'>So murder is their only solution.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39725' title='39725'>'That seems very clear.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39726' title='39726'>'Now we will take another fine of reasoning. </span>
<span sid='39727' title='39727'>When you follow two separate chains of thought, Watson, you will find some point of intersection which should approximate to the truth. </span>
<span sid='39728' title='39728'>We will start now, not from the lady, but from the coffin, and argue backwards. </span>
<span sid='39729' title='39729'>That incident proves, I fear, beyond all doubt that the lady is dead. </span>
<span sid='39730' title='39730'>It points also to an orthodox burial with proper accompaniment of medical certificate and official sanction. </span>
<span sid='39731' title='39731'>Had the lady been obviously murdered, they would have buried her in a hole in the back garden. </span>
<span sid='39732' title='39732'>But here all is open and regular. </span>
<span sid='39733' title='39733'>What does that mean? </span>
<span sid='39734' title='39734'>Surely that they have done her to death in some way which has deceived the doctor, and simulated a natural end - poisoning, perhaps. </span>
<span sid='39735' title='39735'>And yet how strange that they should ever let a doctor approach her unless he were a confederate, which is hardly a credible proposition.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39736' title='39736'>'Could they have forged a medical certificate?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39737' title='39737'>'Dangerous, Watson, very dangerous. </span>
<span sid='39738' title='39738'>No, I hardly see them doing that. </span>
<span sid='39739' title='39739'>Pull up, cabby! </span>
<span sid='39740' title='39740'>This is evidently the undertaker's, for we have just passed the pawnbroker's. </span>
<span sid='39741' title='39741'>Would you go in, Watson? </span>
<span sid='39742' title='39742'>Your appearance inspires confidence. </span>
<span sid='39743' title='39743'>Ask what hour the Poultney Square funeral takes place tomorrow.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39744' title='39744'>The woman in the shop answered me without hesitation that it was to be at eight o'clock in the morning.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39745' title='39745'>'You see, Watson, no mystery, everything above-board! </span>
<span sid='39746' title='39746'>In some way the legal forms have undoubtedly been complied with, and they think that they have little to fear. </span>
<span sid='39747' title='39747'>Well, there's nothing for it now but a direct frontal attack. </span>
<span sid='39748' title='39748'>'Are you armed?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39749' title='39749'>'My stick.!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39750' title='39750'>'Well, well, we shall be strong enough. </span>
<span sid='39751' title='39751'>"Thrice is he armed who hath his quarrel just." </span>
<span sid='39752' title='39752'>We simply can't afford to wait for the police, or to keep within the four corners of the law. </span>
<span sid='39753' title='39753'>You can drive off, cabby. </span>
<span sid='39754' title='39754'>Now, Watson, we'll just take our luck together, as we have occasionally done in the past.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39755' title='39755'>He had rung loudly at the door of a great dark house in the centre of Poultney Square. </span>
<span sid='39756' title='39756'>It was opened immediately, and the figure of a tall woman was outlined against the dimlit hall.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39757' title='39757'>'Well, what do you want?' she asked, sharply, peering at us through the darkness.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39758' title='39758'>'I want to speak to Dr Shlessinger,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39759' title='39759'>'There is no such person here,' she answered, and tried to close the door, but Holmes had jammed it with his foot.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39760' title='39760'>'Well, I want to see the man who lives here, whatever he may call himself,' said Holmes firmly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39761' title='39761'>She hesitated. </span>
<span sid='39762' title='39762'>Then she threw open the door. </span>
<span sid='39763' title='39763'>'Well, come in!' said she. </span>
<span sid='39764' title='39764'>'My husband is not afraid to face any man in the world.' </span>
<span sid='39765' title='39765'>She closed the door behind us, and showed us into a sitting-room on the right side of the hall, turning up the gas as she left us. </span>
<span sid='39766' title='39766'>'Mr Peters will be with you in an instant,' she said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39767' title='39767'>Her words were literally true, for we had hardly time to look round the dusty and moth-eaten apartment in which we found ourselves before the door opened and a big, cleanshaven, bald-headed man stepped lightly into the room. </span>
<span sid='39768' title='39768'>He had a large red face, with pendulous cheeks, and a general air of superficial benevolence which was marred by a cruel, vicious mouth.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39769' title='39769'>'There is surely some mistake here, gentlemen,' he said, in an unctuous, make-everything-easy voice. </span>
<span sid='39770' title='39770'>'I fancy that you have been misdirected. </span>
<span sid='39771' title='39771'>Possibly if you tried farther down the street-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39772' title='39772'>'That will do, we have no time to waste,' said my companion, firmly. </span>
<span sid='39773' title='39773'>'You are Henry Peters, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Adelaide&t=h'>Adelaide</a>, late the Rev. </span>
<span sid='39774' title='39774'>Dr Shlessinger, of Baden and South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>. </span>
<span sid='39775' title='39775'>I am as sure of that as that my own name is Sherlock Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39776' title='39776'>Peters, as I will now call him, started and stared hard at his formidable pursuer. </span>
<span sid='39777' title='39777'>'I guess your name does not frighten me, Mr Holmes,' said he, coolly. </span>
<span sid='39778' title='39778'>'When a man's conscience is easy, you can't rattle him. </span>
<span sid='39779' title='39779'>What is your business in my house?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39780' title='39780'>'I want to know what you have done with the Lady <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>s Carfax, whom you brought away with you from Baden.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39781' title='39781'>'I'd be very glad if you could tell me where that lady may be,' Peters answered, coolly. </span>
<span sid='39782' title='39782'>'I've a bill against her for nearly a hundred pounds, and nothing to show for it but a couple of trumpery pendants that the dealer would hardly look at. </span>
<span sid='39783' title='39783'>She attached herself to Mrs Peters and me at Baden (it is a fact that I was using another name at the time), and she stuck on to us until we came to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='39784' title='39784'>I paid her bill and her ticket. </span>
<span sid='39785' title='39785'>Once in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, she gave us the slip, and, as I say, left these out-of-date jewels to pay her bills. </span>
<span sid='39786' title='39786'>You find her, Mr Holmes, and I'm your debtor.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39787' title='39787'>'I mean to find her,' said Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='39788' title='39788'>'I'm going through this house till I do find her.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39789' title='39789'>'Where is your warrant?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39790' title='39790'>Holmes half drew a revolver from his pocket. </span>
<span sid='39791' title='39791'>'This will have to serve till a better one comes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39792' title='39792'>'Why, you are a common burglar.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39793' title='39793'>'So you might describe me,' said Holmes, cheerfully. </span>
<span sid='39794' title='39794'>'My companion is also a dangerous ruffian. </span>
<span sid='39795' title='39795'>And together we are going through your house.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39796' title='39796'>Our opponent opened the door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39797' title='39797'>'Fetch a policeman, Annie!' said he. </span>
<span sid='39798' title='39798'>There was a whisk of feminine skirts down the passage, and the hall door was opened and shut.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39799' title='39799'>'Our time is limited, Watson,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='39800' title='39800'>'If you try to stop us, Peters, you will most certainly get hurt. </span>
<span sid='39801' title='39801'>Where is that coffin which was brought into your house?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39802' title='39802'>'What do you want with the coffin? </span>
<span sid='39803' title='39803'>It is in use. </span>
<span sid='39804' title='39804'>There is a body in it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39805' title='39805'>'I must see that body.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39806' title='39806'>'Never with my consent.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39807' title='39807'>'Then without it.' </span>
<span sid='39808' title='39808'>With a quick movement Holmes pushed the fellow to one side and passed into the hall. </span>
<span sid='39809' title='39809'>A door half open stood immediately before us. </span>
<span sid='39810' title='39810'>We entered. </span>
<span sid='39811' title='39811'>It was the dining-room. </span>
<span sid='39812' title='39812'>On the table, under a half-lit chandelier, the coffin was lying. </span>
<span sid='39813' title='39813'>Holmes turned up the gas and raised the lid. </span>
<span sid='39814' title='39814'>Deep down in the recesses of the coffin lay an emaciated figure. </span>
<span sid='39815' title='39815'>The glare from the lights above beat down upon an aged and withered face. </span>
<span sid='39816' title='39816'>By no possible process of cruelty, starvation, or disease could this worn-out wreck be the still beautiful Lady <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>s. </span>
<span sid='39817' title='39817'>Holmes's face showed his amazement, and also his relief.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39818' title='39818'>'Thank God!' he muttered. </span>
<span sid='39819' title='39819'>'It's someone else.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39820' title='39820'>'Ah, you've blundered badly for once, Mr Sherlock Holmes,' said Peters, who had followed us into the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39821' title='39821'>'Who is this dead woman?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39822' title='39822'>'Well, if you really must know, she is an old nurse of my wife's, Rose Spender her name, whom we found in the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a> Workhouse Infirmary. </span>
<span sid='39823' title='39823'>We brought her round here, called in Dr Horsom, of 13, Firbank Villas - mind you take the address, Mr Holmes - and had her carefully tended, as Christian folk should. </span>
<span sid='39824' title='39824'>On the third day she died - certificate says senile decay - but that's only the doctor's opinion, and, of course, you know better. </span>
<span sid='39825' title='39825'>We ordered her funeral to be carried out by Stirmon and Co., of the Kennington Road, who will bury her at eight o'clock tomorrow morning. </span>
<span sid='39826' title='39826'>Can you pick any hole in that, Mr Holmes? </span>
<span sid='39827' title='39827'>You've made a silly blunder, and you may as well own up to it. </span>
<span sid='39828' title='39828'>I'd give something for a photograph of your gaping, staring face when you pulled aside that lid expecting to see the Lady <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>s Carfax, and only found a poor old woman of ninety.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39829' title='39829'>Holmes's expression was as impassive as ever under the jeers of his antagonist, but his clenched hands betrayed his acute annoyance.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39830' title='39830'>'I am going through your house,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39831' title='39831'>'Are you, though!' cried Peters, as a woman's voice and heavy steps sounded in the passage. </span>
<span sid='39832' title='39832'>'We'll soon see about that. </span>
<span sid='39833' title='39833'>This way, officers, if you please. </span>
<span sid='39834' title='39834'>These men have forced their way into my house, and I cannot get rid of them. </span>
<span sid='39835' title='39835'>Help me to put them out.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39836' title='39836'>A sergeant and a constable stood in the doorway. </span>
<span sid='39837' title='39837'>Holmes drew his card from his case.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39838' title='39838'>'This is my name and address. </span>
<span sid='39839' title='39839'>This is my friend, Dr Watson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39840' title='39840'>'Bless you, sir, we know you very well,' said the sergeant, 'but you can't stay here without a warrant.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39841' title='39841'>'Of course not. </span>
<span sid='39842' title='39842'>I quite understand that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39843' title='39843'>'Arrest him!' cried Peters.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39844' title='39844'>'We know where to lay our hands on this gentleman if he is wanted,' said the sergeant, majestically, 'but you'll have to go, Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39845' title='39845'>'Yes, Watson, we shall have to go.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39846' title='39846'>A minute later we were in the street once more. </span>
<span sid='39847' title='39847'>Holmes was as cool as ever, but I was hot with anger and humiliation. </span>
<span sid='39848' title='39848'>The sergeant had followed us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39849' title='39849'>'Sorry, Mr Holmes, but that's the law.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39850' title='39850'>'Exactly, sergeant, you could not do otherwise.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39851' title='39851'>'I expect there was good reason for your presence there. </span>
<span sid='39852' title='39852'>If there is anything I can do-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39853' title='39853'>'It's a missing lady, sergeant, and we think she is in that house. </span>
<span sid='39854' title='39854'>I expect a warrant presently.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39855' title='39855'>'Then I'll keep my eye on the parties, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='39856' title='39856'>If anything comes along, I will surely let you know.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39857' title='39857'>It was only nine o'clock, and we were off full cry upon the trail at once. </span>
<span sid='39858' title='39858'>First we drove to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a> Workhouse Infirmary, where we found that it was indeed the truth that a charitable couple had called some days before, that they had claimed an imbecile old woman as a former servant, and that they had obtained permission to take her away with them. </span>
<span sid='39859' title='39859'>No surprise was expressed at the news that she had since died.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39860' title='39860'>The doctor was our next goal. </span>
<span sid='39861' title='39861'>He had been called in, had found the woman dying of pure senility, had actually seen her pass away, and had signed the certificate in due form. </span>
<span sid='39862' title='39862'>'I assure you that everything was perfectly normal and there was no room for foul play in the matter,' said he. </span>
<span sid='39863' title='39863'>Nothing in the house had struck him as suspicious, save that for people of their class it was remarkable that they should have no servant. </span>
<span sid='39864' title='39864'>So far and no farther went the doctor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39865' title='39865'>Finally, we found our way to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>. </span>
<span sid='39866' title='39866'>There had been difficulties of procedure in regard to the warrant. </span>
<span sid='39867' title='39867'>Some delay was inevitable. </span>
<span sid='39868' title='39868'>The magistrate's signature might not be obtained until next morning. </span>
<span sid='39869' title='39869'>If Holmes would call about nine he could go down with Lestrade and see it acted upon. </span>
<span sid='39870' title='39870'>So ended the day, save that near midnight our friend, the sergeant, called to say that he had seen flickering lights here and there in the windows of the great dark house, but that no one had left it and none had entered. </span>
<span sid='39871' title='39871'>We could but pray for patience, and wait for the morrow.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39872' title='39872'>Sherlock Holmes was too irritable for conversation and too restless for sleep. </span>
<span sid='39873' title='39873'>I left him smoking hard, with his heavy, dark brows knotted together, and his long, nervous fingers tapping upon the arms of his chair, as he turned over in his mind every possible solution of the mystery. </span>
<span sid='39874' title='39874'>Several times in the course of the night I heard him prowling about the house. </span>
<span sid='39875' title='39875'>Finally, just after I had been called in the morning, he rushed into my room. </span>
<span sid='39876' title='39876'>He was in his dressing-gown, but his pale, hollow-eyed face told me that his night had been a sleepless one.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39877' title='39877'>'What time was the funeral? </span>
<span sid='39878' title='39878'>Eight, was it not?' he asked, eagerly. </span>
<span sid='39879' title='39879'>'Well, it is seven-twenty now. </span>
<span sid='39880' title='39880'>Good heavens, Watson, what has become of any brains that God has given me? </span>
<span sid='39881' title='39881'>Quick, man, quick.' </span>
<span sid='39882' title='39882'>It's fife or death - a hundred chances on death to one on life. </span>
<span sid='39883' title='39883'>I'll never forgive myself, never, if we are too late!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39884' title='39884'>Five minutes had not passed before we were flying in a hansom down <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='39885' title='39885'>But even so it was twenty-five to eight as we passed Big Ben, and eight struck as we tore down the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a> Road. </span>
<span sid='39886' title='39886'>But others were late as well as we. </span>
<span sid='39887' title='39887'>Ten minutes after the hour the hearse was stiff standing at the door of the house, and even as our foaming horse came to a halt the coffin, supported by three men, appeared on the threshold. </span>
<span sid='39888' title='39888'>Holmes darted forward and barred their way.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39889' title='39889'>'Take it back!' he cried, laying his hand on the breast of the foremost. </span>
<span sid='39890' title='39890'>'Take it back this instant!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39891' title='39891'>'What the devil do you mean? </span>
<span sid='39892' title='39892'>Once again I ask you, where is your warrant?' shouted the furious Peters, his big red face glaring over the farther end of the coffin.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39893' title='39893'>'The warrant is on its way. </span>
<span sid='39894' title='39894'>This coffin shall remain in the house until it comes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39895' title='39895'>The authority in Holmes's voice had its effect upon the bearers. </span>
<span sid='39896' title='39896'>Peters had suddenly vanished into the house, and they obeyed these new orders. </span>
<span sid='39897' title='39897'>'Quick, Watson, quick! </span>
<span sid='39898' title='39898'>Here is a screw-driver!' he shouted as the coffin was replaced upon the table. </span>
<span sid='39899' title='39899'>'Here's one for you, my man! </span>
<span sid='39900' title='39900'>A sovereign if the lid comes off in a minute! </span>
<span sid='39901' title='39901'>Ask no questions - work away! </span>
<span sid='39902' title='39902'>That's good! </span>
<span sid='39903' title='39903'>Another! </span>
<span sid='39904' title='39904'>And another! </span>
<span sid='39905' title='39905'>Now pull all together! </span>
<span sid='39906' title='39906'>It's giving! </span>
<span sid='39907' title='39907'>It's giving! </span>
<span sid='39908' title='39908'>Ah, that does it at last!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39909' title='39909'>With a united effort we tore off the coffin-lid. </span>
<span sid='39910' title='39910'>As we did so there came from the inside a stupefying and overpowering smell of chloroform. </span>
<span sid='39911' title='39911'>A body lay within, its head all wreathed in cotton-wool, which had been soaked in the narcotic. </span>
<span sid='39912' title='39912'>Holmes plucked it off and disclosed the statuesque face of a handsome and spiritual woman of middle age. </span>
<span sid='39913' title='39913'>In an instant he had passed his arm round the figure and raised her to a sitting position.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39914' title='39914'>'Is she gone, Watson? </span>
<span sid='39915' title='39915'>Is there a spark left? </span>
<span sid='39916' title='39916'>Surely we are not too late!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39917' title='39917'>For half an hour it seemed that we were. </span>
<span sid='39918' title='39918'>What with actual suffocation, and what with the poisonous fumes of the chloroform, the Lady <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>s seemed to have passed the last point of recall. </span>
<span sid='39919' title='39919'>And then, at last, with artificial respiration, with injected ether, with every device that science could suggest, some flutter of life, some quiver of the eyelids, some dimming of a mirror, spoke of the slowly returning life. </span>
<span sid='39920' title='39920'>A cab had driven up, and Holmes, parting the blind, looked out at it. </span>
<span sid='39921' title='39921'>'Here is Lestrade with his warrant,' said he. </span>
<span sid='39922' title='39922'>'He will find that his birds have flown. </span>
<span sid='39923' title='39923'>And here,' he added, as a heavy step hurried along the passage, 'is someone who has a better right to nurse this lady than we have. </span>
<span sid='39924' title='39924'>Good morning, Mr Green, I think that the sooner we can move the lady <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>s the better. </span>
<span sid='39925' title='39925'>Meanwhile, the funeral may proceed, and the poor old woman who still lies in that coffin may go to her last resting-place alone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='39926' title='39926'>'Should you care to add the case to your annals, my dear Watson,' said Holmes that evening, 'it can only be as an example of that temporary eclipse to which even the best-balanced mind may be exposed. </span>
<span sid='39927' title='39927'>Such slips are common to all mortals, and the greatest is he who can recognize and repair them. </span>
<span sid='39928' title='39928'>To this modified credit I may, perhaps, make some claim. </span>
<span sid='39929' title='39929'>My night was haunted by the thought that somewhere a clue, a strange sentence, a curious observation, had come under my notice and had been too easily dismissed. </span>
<span sid='39930' title='39930'>Then, suddenly, in the grey of the morning, the words came back to me. </span>
<span sid='39931' title='39931'>It was the remark of the undertaker's wife, as reported by Philip Green. </span>
<span sid='39932' title='39932'>She had said, "It should be there before now. </span>
<span sid='39933' title='39933'>It took longer, being out of the ordinary." </span>
<span sid='39934' title='39934'>It was the coffin of which she spoke. </span>
<span sid='39935' title='39935'>It had been out of the ordinary. </span>
<span sid='39936' title='39936'>That could only mean that it had been made to some special measurement. </span>
<span sid='39937' title='39937'>But why? </span>
<span sid='39938' title='39938'>Why? </span>
<span sid='39939' title='39939'>Then in an instant I remembered the deep sides, and the little wasted figure at the bottom. </span>
<span sid='39940' title='39940'>Why so large a coffin for so small a body? </span>
<span sid='39941' title='39941'>To leave room for another body. </span>
<span sid='39942' title='39942'>Both would be buried under the one certificate. </span>
<span sid='39943' title='39943'>It had all been so clear, if only my own sight had not been dimmed. </span>
<span sid='39944' title='39944'>At eight the lady <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>s would be buried. </span>
<span sid='39945' title='39945'>Our one chance was to stop the coffin before it left the house.</span>
<p>
<span sid='39946' title='39946'>'It was a desperate chance that we might find her alive, but it was a chance, as the result showed. </span>
<span sid='39947' title='39947'>These people had never, to my knowledge, done a murder. </span>
<span sid='39948' title='39948'>They might shrink from actual violence at the last. </span>
<span sid='39949' title='39949'>They could bury her with no sign of how she met her end, and even if she were exhumed there was a chance for them. </span>
<span sid='39950' title='39950'>I hoped that such considerations might prevail with them. </span>
<span sid='39951' title='39951'>You can reconstruct the scene well enough. </span>
<span sid='39952' title='39952'>You saw the horrible den upstairs, where the poor lady had been kept so long. </span>
<span sid='39953' title='39953'>They rushed in and overpowered her with their chloroform, carried her down, poured more into the coffin to insure against her waking, and then screwed down the lid. </span>
<span sid='39954' title='39954'>A clever device, Watson. </span>
<span sid='39955' title='39955'>It is new to me in the annals of crime. </span>
<span sid='39956' title='39956'>If our ex-missionary friends escape the clutches of Lestrade, I shall expect to hear of some brilliant incidents in their future career.'</span>
