<p>
<span sid='15910' title='15910'>'Holmes,' said I, as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down the street, 'here is a madman coming along. </span>
<span sid='15911' title='15911'>It seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15912' title='15912'>My friend rose lazily from his armchair, and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. </span>
<span sid='15913' title='15913'>It was a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. </span>
<span sid='15914' title='15914'>Down the centre of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell. </span>
<span sid='15915' title='15915'>The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer passengers than usual. </span>
<span sid='15916' title='15916'>Indeed, from the direction of the Metropolitan station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15917' title='15917'>He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. </span>
<span sid='15918' title='15918'>He was dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. </span>
<span sid='15919' title='15919'>Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. </span>
<span sid='15920' title='15920'>As he ran he jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15921' title='15921'>'What on earth can be the matter with him?' I asked. </span>
<span sid='15922' title='15922'>'He is looking up at the numbers of the houses.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15923' title='15923'>'I believe that he is coming here,' said Holmes, rubbing his hands.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15924' title='15924'>'Here?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15925' title='15925'>'Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. </span>
<span sid='15926' title='15926'>I think that I recognize the symptoms. </span>
<span sid='15927' title='15927'>Ha! did I not tell you?' </span>
<span sid='15928' title='15928'>As he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door, and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15929' title='15929'>A few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. </span>
<span sid='15930' title='15930'>For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason. </span>
<span sid='15931' title='15931'>Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him, and tore him away to the centre of the room. </span>
<span sid='15932' title='15932'>Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair, and, sitting beside him, patted his hand, and chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15933' title='15933'>'You have come to me to tell me your story, have you not?' said he. </span>
<span sid='15934' title='15934'>'You are fatigued with your haste. </span>
<span sid='15935' title='15935'>Pray wait until you have recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15936' title='15936'>The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his emotion. </span>
<span sid='15937' title='15937'>Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15938' title='15938'>'No doubt you think me mad?' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15939' title='15939'>'I see that you have had some great trouble,' responded Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15940' title='15940'>'God knows I have! - a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. </span>
<span sid='15941' title='15941'>Public disgrace I might have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain. </span>
<span sid='15942' title='15942'>Private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very soul. </span>
<span sid='15943' title='15943'>Besides, it is not I alone. </span>
<span sid='15944' title='15944'>The very nobles in the land may suffer, unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15945' title='15945'>'Pray compose yourself, sir,' said Holmes, 'and let me have a clear account of who you are, and what it is that has befallen you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15946' title='15946'>'My name,' answered our visitor, 'is probably familiar to your ears. </span>
<span sid='15947' title='15947'>I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Threadneedle Street&t=h'>Threadneedle Street</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15948' title='15948'>The name was indeed well known to us, as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the City of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>&t=h'>the City of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a></a>. </span>
<span sid='15949' title='15949'>What could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> to this most pitiable pass? </span>
<span sid='15950' title='15950'>We waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15951' title='15951'>'I feel that time is of value,' said he, 'that is why I hastened here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your co-operation. </span>
<span sid='15952' title='15952'>I came to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> by the Underground, and hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. </span>
<span sid='15953' title='15953'>That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little exercise. </span>
<span sid='15954' title='15954'>I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15955' title='15955'>'It is, of course, well known to you, that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds, as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors. </span>
<span sid='15956' title='15956'>One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. </span>
<span sid='15957' title='15957'>We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15958' title='15958'>'Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the Bank, when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. </span>
<span sid='15959' title='15959'>I started when I saw the name, for it was that of none other than - well, perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth - one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>. </span>
<span sid='15960' title='15960'>I was overwhelmed by the honour, and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15961' title='15961'>'"Mr Holder," said he, "I have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money."</span>
<p>
<span sid='15962' title='15962'>'"The firm do so when the security is good," I answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15963' title='15963'>'"It is absolutely essential to me," said he, "that I should have fifty thousand pounds at once. </span>
<span sid='15964' title='15964'>I could of course borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business, and to carry out that business myself. </span>
<span sid='15965' title='15965'>In my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place oneself under obligations."</span>
<p>
<span sid='15966' title='15966'>'"For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?" I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15967' title='15967'>'"Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it right to charge. </span>
<span sid='15968' title='15968'>But it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once."</span>
<p>
<span sid='15969' title='15969'>'"I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse," said I, "were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear. </span>
<span sid='15970' title='15970'>If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that, even in your case, every business-like precaution should be taken."</span>
<p>
<span sid='15971' title='15971'>'"I should much prefer to have it so," said he, raising up a square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. </span>
<span sid='15972' title='15972'>"You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='15973' title='15973'>'"One of the most precious public possessions of the Empire," said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15974' title='15974'>'"Precisely." </span>
<span sid='15975' title='15975'>He opened the case, and there, embedded in soft, flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named. </span>
<span sid='15976' title='15976'>"There are thirty-nine enormous beryls," said he, "and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. </span>
<span sid='15977' title='15977'>The lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked I am prepared to leave it with you as my security."</span>
<p>
<span sid='15978' title='15978'>'I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15979' title='15979'>'"You doubt its value?" he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15980' title='15980'>'"Not at all. </span>
<span sid='15981' title='15981'>I only doubt-"</span>
<p>
<span sid='15982' title='15982'>'"The propriety of my leaving it. </span>
<span sid='15983' title='15983'>You may set your mind at rest about that. </span>
<span sid='15984' title='15984'>I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. </span>
<span sid='15985' title='15985'>It is a pure matter of form. </span>
<span sid='15986' title='15986'>Is the security sufficient?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='15987' title='15987'>'"Ample."</span>
<p>
<span sid='15988' title='15988'>'"You understand, Mr Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard of you. </span>
<span sid='15989' title='15989'>I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter, but, above all, to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution, because I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. </span>
<span sid='15990' title='15990'>Any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them. </span>
<span sid='15991' title='15991'>I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall call for it in person on Monday morning."</span>
<p>
<span sid='15992' title='15992'>'Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more; but, calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty thousand-pound notes. </span>
<span sid='15993' title='15993'>When I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. </span>
<span sid='15994' title='15994'>There could be no doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it. </span>
<span sid='15995' title='15995'>I already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it. </span>
<span sid='15996' title='15996'>However, it was too late to alter the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe, and turned once more to my work.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15997' title='15997'>'When evening came, I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me. </span>
<span sid='15998' title='15998'>Bankers' safes had been forced before now, and why should not mine be? </span>
<span sid='15999' title='15999'>If so, how terrible would be the position in which I should find myself? </span>
<span sid='16000' title='16000'>I determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case backwards and forwards with me, so that it might never be really out of my reach. </span>
<span sid='16001' title='16001'>With this intention, I called a cab, and drove out to my house at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Streatham&t=h'>Streatham</a>, carrying the jewel with me. </span>
<span sid='16002' title='16002'>I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs, and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16003' title='16003'>'And now a word as to my household, Mr Holmes, for I wish you to thoroughly understand the situation. </span>
<span sid='16004' title='16004'>My groom and my page sleep out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. </span>
<span sid='16005' title='16005'>I have three maid-servants who have been with me a number of years, and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. </span>
<span sid='16006' title='16006'>Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting- maid, has only been in my service a few months. </span>
<span sid='16007' title='16007'>She came with an excellent character, however, and has always given me satisfaction. </span>
<span sid='16008' title='16008'>She is a very pretty girl, and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place. </span>
<span sid='16009' title='16009'>That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16010' title='16010'>'So much for the servants. </span>
<span sid='16011' title='16011'>My family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it. </span>
<span sid='16012' title='16012'>I am a widower, and have an only son, Arthur. </span>
<span sid='16013' title='16013'>He has been a disappointment to me, Mr Holmes - a grievous disappointment. </span>
<span sid='16014' title='16014'>I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. </span>
<span sid='16015' title='16015'>People tell me that I have spoiled him. </span>
<span sid='16016' title='16016'>Very likely I have. </span>
<span sid='16017' title='16017'>When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to love. </span>
<span sid='16018' title='16018'>I could not bear to see the smile Fade even for a moment from his face. </span>
<span sid='16019' title='16019'>I have never denied him a wish. </span>
<span sid='16020' title='16020'>Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I meant it for the best.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16021' title='16021'>'It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business, but he was not of a business turn. </span>
<span sid='16022' title='16022'>He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money. </span>
<span sid='16023' title='16023'>When he was young tic became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits. </span>
<span sid='16024' title='16024'>He learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. </span>
<span sid='16025' title='16025'>He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend Sir George Burnwell was enough to draw him back again.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16026' title='16026'>'And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner. </span>
<span sid='16027' title='16027'>He is older than Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who has been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. </span>
<span sid='16028' title='16028'>Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech, and the look which I have caught in his eyes, that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. </span>
<span sid='16029' title='16029'>So I think, and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman's quick insight into character.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16030' title='16030'>'And now there is only she to be described. </span>
<span sid='16031' title='16031'>She is my niece; but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. </span>
<span sid='16032' title='16032'>She is a sunbeam in my house - sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be. </span>
<span sid='16033' title='16033'>She is my right hand. </span>
<span sid='16034' title='16034'>I do not know what I could do without her. </span>
<span sid='16035' title='16035'>In only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. </span>
<span sid='16036' title='16036'>Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. </span>
<span sid='16037' title='16037'>I think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late - for ever too late!</span>
<p>
<span sid='16038' title='16038'>'Now, Mr Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I shall continue with my miserable story.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16039' title='16039'>'When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night, after dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my client. </span>
<span sid='16040' title='16040'>Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed. </span>
<span sid='16041' title='16041'>Mary and Arthur were much interested, and wished to see the famous coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16042' title='16042'>'"Where have you put it?" asked Arthur.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16043' title='16043'>'"In my own bureau."</span>
<p>
<span sid='16044' title='16044'>'"Well, I hope to goodness the house won't be burgled during the night," said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16045' title='16045'>'"It is locked up," I answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16046' title='16046'>'"Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. </span>
<span sid='16047' title='16047'>When I was a youngster I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard."</span>
<p>
<span sid='16048' title='16048'>'He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what he said. </span>
<span sid='16049' title='16049'>He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very grave face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16050' title='16050'>'"Look here, dad," said he, with his eyes cast down. </span>
<span sid='16051' title='16051'>"Can you let me have two hundred pounds?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='16052' title='16052'>'"No, I cannot!" I answered sharply. </span>
<span sid='16053' title='16053'>"I have been far too generous with you in money matters."</span>
<p>
<span sid='16054' title='16054'>'"You have been very kind," said he; "but I must have this money, or else I can never show my face inside the club again."</span>
<p>
<span sid='16055' title='16055'>'"And a very good thing, too!" I cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16056' title='16056'>'"Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man," said he. </span>
<span sid='16057' title='16057'>"I could not bear the disgrace. </span>
<span sid='16058' title='16058'>I must raise the money in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try other means."</span>
<p>
<span sid='16059' title='16059'>'I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. </span>
<span sid='16060' title='16060'>"You shall not have a farthing from me," I cried, on which he bowed and left the room without another word.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16061' title='16061'>'When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was safe, and locked it again. </span>
<span sid='16062' title='16062'>Then I started to go round the house to see that all was secure - a duty which I usually leave to Mary, but which I thought it well to perform myself that night. </span>
<span sid='16063' title='16063'>As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16064' title='16064'>'"Tell me, dad," said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, "did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='16065' title='16065'>'"Certainly not."</span>
<p>
<span sid='16066' title='16066'>'"She came in just now by the back door. </span>
<span sid='16067' title='16067'>I have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone but I think that it is hardly safe, and should be stopped."</span>
<p>
<span sid='16068' title='16068'>'"You must speak to her in the morning, or I will, if you prefer it. </span>
<span sid='16069' title='16069'>Are you sure that everything is fastened?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='16070' title='16070'>'"Quite sure, dad."</span>
<p>
<span sid='16071' title='16071'>'"Then, good-night." </span>
<span sid='16072' title='16072'>I kissed her, and went to my bedroom, where I was soon asleep.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16073' title='16073'>'I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr Holmes, which may have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any point which I do not make clear.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16074' title='16074'>'On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16075' title='16075'>'I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be particularly so. </span>
<span sid='16076' title='16076'>I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual About two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. </span>
<span sid='16077' title='16077'>It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere. </span>
<span sid='16078' title='16078'>I lay listening with all my ears. </span>
<span sid='16079' title='16079'>Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room. </span>
<span sid='16080' title='16080'>I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16081' title='16081'>'"Arthur!" I screamed, "you villain! you thief! </span>
<span sid='16082' title='16082'>How dare you touch that coronet?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='16083' title='16083'>The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding the coronet in his hands. </span>
<span sid='16084' title='16084'>He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. </span>
<span sid='16085' title='16085'>At my cry he dropped it from his grasp, and turned as pale as death. </span>
<span sid='16086' title='16086'>I snatched it up and examined it. </span>
<span sid='16087' title='16087'>One of the gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16088' title='16088'>'"You blackguard!" I shouted, beside myself with rage. </span>
<span sid='16089' title='16089'>"You have destroyed it! </span>
<span sid='16090' title='16090'>You have dishonoured me for ever! </span>
<span sid='16091' title='16091'>Where are the jewels you have stolen?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='16092' title='16092'>'"Stolen!" he cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16093' title='16093'>'"Yes, you thief!" </span>
<span sid='16094' title='16094'>I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16095' title='16095'>'"There are none missing. </span>
<span sid='16096' title='16096'>There cannot be any missing," said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16097' title='16097'>'"There are three missing. </span>
<span sid='16098' title='16098'>And you know where they are. </span>
<span sid='16099' title='16099'>Must I call you a liar as well as a thief? </span>
<span sid='16100' title='16100'>Did I not see you trying to tear off another piece?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='16101' title='16101'>'"You have called me names enough," said he; "I will not stand it any longer. </span>
<span sid='16102' title='16102'>I shall not say another word about this business since you have chosen to insult me. </span>
<span sid='16103' title='16103'>I will leave your house in the morning, and make my own way in the world."</span>
<p>
<span sid='16104' title='16104'>'"You shall leave it in the hands of the police!" I cried, half mad with grief and rage. </span>
<span sid='16105' title='16105'>"I shall have this matter probed to the bottom."</span>
<p>
<span sid='16106' title='16106'>'"You shall learn nothing from me," said he, with a passion such as I should not have thought was in his nature. </span>
<span sid='16107' title='16107'>"If you choose to call the police, let them find what they can."</span>
<p>
<span sid='16108' title='16108'>'By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in my anger. </span>
<span sid='16109' title='16109'>Mary was the first to rush into my room, and at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur's face, The read the whole story, and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the ground. </span>
<span sid='16110' title='16110'>I sent the housemaid for the police, and put the investigation into their hands at once. </span>
<span sid='16111' title='16111'>When the Inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft. </span>
<span sid='16112' title='16112'>I answered that it had ceased to be a private matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was national property. </span>
<span sid='16113' title='16113'>I was determined that the law should have its way in everything.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16114' title='16114'>"At least," said he, "you will not have me arrested at once. </span>
<span sid='16115' title='16115'>It would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for five minutes."</span>
<p>
<span sid='16116' title='16116'>'"That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen," said I. </span>
<span sid='16117' title='16117'>And then realizing We dreadful position in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour, but that of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. </span>
<span sid='16118' title='16118'>He might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16119' title='16119'>'"You may as well face the matter," said I; "you have been caught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. </span>
<span sid='16120' title='16120'>If you make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten."</span>
<p>
<span sid='16121' title='16121'>'"Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it," he answered, turning away from me with a sneer. </span>
<span sid='16122' title='16122'>I saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him. </span>
<span sid='16123' title='16123'>There was but one way for it. </span>
<span sid='16124' title='16124'>I called in the inspector, and gave him into custody. </span>
<span sid='16125' title='16125'>A search was made at once, not only of his person, but of his room, and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats. </span>
<span sid='16126' title='16126'>This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to you, to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. </span>
<span sid='16127' title='16127'>The police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it. </span>
<span sid='16128' title='16128'>You may go to any expense which you think necessary. </span>
<span sid='16129' title='16129'>I have already offered a reward of a thousand pounds. </span>
<span sid='16130' title='16130'>My God, what shall I do! </span>
<span sid='16131' title='16131'>I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night. </span>
<span sid='16132' title='16132'>Oh, what shall I do!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16133' title='16133'>He put a hand on either side of his head, and rocked himself to and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16134' title='16134'>Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some minutes, with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16135' title='16135'>'Do you receive much company?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16136' title='16136'>'None, save my partner with his family, and an occasional friend of Arthur's. </span>
<span sid='16137' title='16137'>Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. </span>
<span sid='16138' title='16138'>No one else, I think.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16139' title='16139'>'Do you go out much in society?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16140' title='16140'>'Arthur does. </span>
<span sid='16141' title='16141'>Mary and I stay at home. </span>
<span sid='16142' title='16142'>We neither of us care for it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16143' title='16143'>'That is unusual in a young girl.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16144' title='16144'>'She is of a quiet nature. </span>
<span sid='16145' title='16145'>Besides, she is not so very young. </span>
<span sid='16146' title='16146'>She is four-and-twenty.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16147' title='16147'>'This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her also.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16148' title='16148'>'Terrible! </span>
<span sid='16149' title='16149'>She is even more affected than I.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16150' title='16150'>'You have neither of you any doubt as to your son's guilt?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16151' title='16151'>'How can we have, when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16152' title='16152'>'I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. </span>
<span sid='16153' title='16153'>Was the remainder of the coronet at all injured?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16154' title='16154'>'Yes, it was twisted.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16155' title='16155'>'Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16156' title='16156'>'God bless you! </span>
<span sid='16157' title='16157'>You are doing what you can for him and for me. </span>
<span sid='16158' title='16158'>But it is too heavy a task. </span>
<span sid='16159' title='16159'>What was he doing there at all? </span>
<span sid='16160' title='16160'>If his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16161' title='16161'>'Precisely. </span>
<span sid='16162' title='16162'>And if he were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? </span>
<span sid='16163' title='16163'>His silence appears to me to cut both ways. </span>
<span sid='16164' title='16164'>There are several singular points about the case. </span>
<span sid='16165' title='16165'>What did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16166' title='16166'>'They considered that it might be caused by Arthur's losing his bedroom door.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16167' title='16167'>'A likely story! </span>
<span sid='16168' title='16168'>As if a man bent on felony would slam the door so as to awake a household. </span>
<span sid='16169' title='16169'>What did they say, then, of the disappearance of these gems?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16170' title='16170'>'They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16171' title='16171'>'Have they thought of looking outside the house?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16172' title='16172'>'Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. </span>
<span sid='16173' title='16173'>The whole garden has already been minutely examined.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16174' title='16174'>'Now, my dear sir,' said Holmes, 'is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think? </span>
<span sid='16175' title='16175'>It appeared to you to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. </span>
<span sid='16176' title='16176'>Consider what is involved by your theory. </span>
<span sid='16177' title='16177'>You suppose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. </span>
<span sid='16178' title='16178'>I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16179' title='16179'>'But what other is there?' cried the banker with a gesture of despair. </span>
<span sid='16180' title='16180'>'If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16181' title='16181'>'It is our task to find out,' replied Holmes, 'so now, if you please, Mr Holder, we will set off for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Streatham&t=h'>Streatham</a> together, and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16182' title='16182'>My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. </span>
<span sid='16183' title='16183'>I confess that the guilt of the banker's son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes's judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. </span>
<span sid='16184' title='16184'>He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast, and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. </span>
<span sid='16185' title='16185'>Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs. </span>
<span sid='16186' title='16186'>A short railway journey, and a shorter walk, brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier. </span>
<span sid='16187' title='16187'>Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little from the road. </span>
<span sid='16188' title='16188'>A double carriage sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to the two large iron gates which closed the entrance. </span>
<span sid='16189' title='16189'>On the right side was a small wooden thicket which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen's entrance. </span>
<span sid='16190' title='16190'>On the left ran a lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. </span>
<span sid='16191' title='16191'>Holmes left us standing at the door, and walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen's path, and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane. </span>
<span sid='16192' title='16192'>So long was he that Mr Holder and I went into the dining-room, and waited by the fire until he should return. </span>
<span sid='16193' title='16193'>We were sitting there in silence when the door opened, and a young lady came in. </span>
<span sid='16194' title='16194'>She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. </span>
<span sid='16195' title='16195'>I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman's face. </span>
<span sid='16196' title='16196'>Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. </span>
<span sid='16197' title='16197'>As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of her grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. </span>
<span sid='16198' title='16198'>Disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle, and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16199' title='16199'>'You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not, dad?' she asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16200' title='16200'>'No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16201' title='16201'>'But I am so sure that he is innocent. </span>
<span sid='16202' title='16202'>You know what women's instincts are. </span>
<span sid='16203' title='16203'>I know that he has done no harm, and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16204' title='16204'>'Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16205' title='16205'>'Who knows? </span>
<span sid='16206' title='16206'>Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16207' title='16207'>'How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16208' title='16208'>'Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. </span>
<span sid='16209' title='16209'>Oh, do, do take my word for it that he is innocent. </span>
<span sid='16210' title='16210'>Let the matter drop, and say no more. </span>
<span sid='16211' title='16211'>It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16212' title='16212'>'I shall never let it drop until the gems are found - never, Mary! </span>
<span sid='16213' title='16213'>Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. </span>
<span sid='16214' title='16214'>Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> to inquire more deeply into it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16215' title='16215'>'This gentleman?' she asked, facing round to me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16216' title='16216'>'No, his friend. </span>
<span sid='16217' title='16217'>He wished us to leave him alone. </span>
<span sid='16218' title='16218'>He is round in the stable lane now.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16219' title='16219'>'The stable lane?' </span>
<span sid='16220' title='16220'>She raised her dark eyebrows. </span>
<span sid='16221' title='16221'>'What can he hope to find there! </span>
<span sid='16222' title='16222'>Ah, this, I suppose, is he. </span>
<span sid='16223' title='16223'>I trust, sir, that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16224' title='16224'>'I fully share your opinion, and, I trust with you, that we may prove it,' returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes. </span>
<span sid='16225' title='16225'>'I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder. </span>
<span sid='16226' title='16226'>Might I ask you a question or two?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16227' title='16227'>'Pray do, sir, if it may help, to clear this horrible affair up.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16228' title='16228'>'You heard nothing yourself last night?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16229' title='16229'>'Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. </span>
<span sid='16230' title='16230'>I heard that, and I came down.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16231' title='16231'>'You shut up the windows and doors the night before. </span>
<span sid='16232' title='16232'>Did you fasten all the windows?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16233' title='16233'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16234' title='16234'>'Were they all fastened this morning?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16235' title='16235'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16236' title='16236'>'You have a maid who has a sweetheart? </span>
<span sid='16237' title='16237'>I think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16238' title='16238'>'Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing- room, and who may have heard uncle's remarks about the coronet.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16239' title='16239'>'I see. </span>
<span sid='16240' title='16240'>You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16241' title='16241'>'But what is the good of all these vague theories,' cried the banker, impatiently, 'when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16242' title='16242'>'Wait a little, Mr Holder. </span>
<span sid='16243' title='16243'>We must come back to that. </span>
<span sid='16244' title='16244'>About this girl, Miss Holder. </span>
<span sid='16245' title='16245'>You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16246' title='16246'>'Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her slipping in. </span>
<span sid='16247' title='16247'>I saw the man, too, in the gloom.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16248' title='16248'>'Do you know him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16249' title='16249'>'Oh, yes; he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round. </span>
<span sid='16250' title='16250'>His name is Francis Prosper.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16251' title='16251'>'He stood,' said Holmes, 'to the left of the door - that is to say, further up the path than is necessary to reach the door?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16252' title='16252'>'Yes, he did.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16253' title='16253'>'And he is a man with a wooden leg?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16254' title='16254'>Something like fear sprang up in the young lady's expressive black eyes. </span>
<span sid='16255' title='16255'>'Why, you are like a magician,' said she. </span>
<span sid='16256' title='16256'>'How do you know that?' </span>
<span sid='16257' title='16257'>She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes's thin, eager face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16258' title='16258'>'I should be very glad now to go upstairs,' said he. </span>
<span sid='16259' title='16259'>'I shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again. </span>
<span sid='16260' title='16260'>Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16261' title='16261'>He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall on to the stable lane. </span>
<span sid='16262' title='16262'>This he opened, and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens. </span>
<span sid='16263' title='16263'>Now we shall go upstairs,' said he, at last.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16264' title='16264'>The banker's dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. </span>
<span sid='16265' title='16265'>Holmes went to the bureau first, and looked hard at the lock.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16266' title='16266'>'Which key was used to open it?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16267' title='16267'>'That which my son himself indicated - that of the cupboard of the lumber-room.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16268' title='16268'>'Have you it here?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16269' title='16269'>'That is it on the dressing-table.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16270' title='16270'>Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16271' title='16271'>'It is a noiseless lock,' said he. </span>
<span sid='16272' title='16272'>'It is no wonder that it did not wake you. </span>
<span sid='16273' title='16273'>This case, I presume, contains the coronet. </span>
<span sid='16274' title='16274'>We must have a look at it.' </span>
<span sid='16275' title='16275'>He opened the case, and, taking out the diadem, he laid it upon the table. </span>
<span sid='16276' title='16276'>It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller's art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. </span>
<span sid='16277' title='16277'>At one side of the coronet was a crooked cracked edge, where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16278' title='16278'>'Now, Mr Holder,' said Holmes; 'here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. </span>
<span sid='16279' title='16279'>Might I beg that you will break it off.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16280' title='16280'>The banker recoiled in horror. </span>
<span sid='16281' title='16281'>'I should not dream of trying,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16282' title='16282'>'Then I will.' </span>
<span sid='16283' title='16283'>Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without result. </span>
<span sid='16284' title='16284'>'I feel it give a little,' said he; 'but, though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to break it. </span>
<span sid='16285' title='16285'>An ordinary man could not do it. </span>
<span sid='16286' title='16286'>Now, what do you think would happen if I did break it, Mr Holder? </span>
<span sid='16287' title='16287'>There would be a noise like a pistol shot. </span>
<span sid='16288' title='16288'>Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed, and that you heard nothing of it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16289' title='16289'>'I do not know what to think. </span>
<span sid='16290' title='16290'>It is all dark to me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16291' title='16291'>'But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. </span>
<span sid='16292' title='16292'>What do you think, Miss Holder?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16293' title='16293'>'I confess that I still share my uncle's perplexity.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16294' title='16294'>'Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16295' title='16295'>'He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16296' title='16296'>'Thank you. </span>
<span sid='16297' title='16297'>We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. </span>
<span sid='16298' title='16298'>With your permission, Mr Holder, I shall now continue my investigations outside.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16299' title='16299'>He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. </span>
<span sid='16300' title='16300'>For an hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16301' title='16301'>'I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr Holder,' said he; 'I can serve you best by returning to my rooms.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16302' title='16302'>'But the gems, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='16303' title='16303'>Where are they?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16304' title='16304'>'I cannot tell.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16305' title='16305'>The banker wrung his hands. </span>
<span sid='16306' title='16306'>'I shall never see them again!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='16307' title='16307'>'And my son? </span>
<span sid='16308' title='16308'>You give me hopes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16309' title='16309'>'My opinion is in no way altered.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16310' title='16310'>'Then for God's sake what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16311' title='16311'>'If you can call upon me at my <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> rooms tomorrow morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer. </span>
<span sid='16312' title='16312'>I understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16313' title='16313'>'I would give my fortune to have them back.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16314' title='16314'>'Very good. </span>
<span sid='16315' title='16315'>I shall look into the matter between this and then. </span>
<span sid='16316' title='16316'>Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16317' title='16317'>It was obvious to me that my companion's mind was now made up about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly imagine. </span>
<span sid='16318' title='16318'>Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon that point, but he always glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. </span>
<span sid='16319' title='16319'>It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our room once more. </span>
<span sid='16320' title='16320'>He hurried to his chamber, and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. </span>
<span sid='16321' title='16321'>With his collar turned up, his shiny seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16322' title='16322'>'I think that this should do,' said he, glancing into the glass above the fireplace. </span>
<span sid='16323' title='16323'>'I only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but I fear that it won't do. </span>
<span sid='16324' title='16324'>I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may be following a will-o'-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. </span>
<span sid='16325' title='16325'>I hope that I may be back in a few hours.' </span>
<span sid='16326' title='16326'>He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and, thrusting this rude meal into his pocket, he started off upon his expedition.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16327' title='16327'>I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. </span>
<span sid='16328' title='16328'>He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16329' title='16329'>'I only looked in as I passed,' said he. </span>
<span sid='16330' title='16330'>'I am going right on.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16331' title='16331'>'Where to?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16332' title='16332'>'Oh, to the other side of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the West&t=h'>the West</a> End. </span>
<span sid='16333' title='16333'>It may be some time before I get back. </span>
<span sid='16334' title='16334'>Don't wait up for me in case I should be late.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16335' title='16335'>'How are you getting on?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16336' title='16336'>'Oh, so so. </span>
<span sid='16337' title='16337'>Nothing to complain of. </span>
<span sid='16338' title='16338'>I have been out to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Streatham&t=h'>Streatham</a> since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. </span>
<span sid='16339' title='16339'>It is a very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal. </span>
<span sid='16340' title='16340'>However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16341' title='16341'>I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply. </span>
<span sid='16342' title='16342'>His eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. </span>
<span sid='16343' title='16343'>He hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16344' title='16344'>I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I retired to my room. </span>
<span sid='16345' title='16345'>It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise. </span>
<span sid='16346' title='16346'>I do not know at what hour he came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning, there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim as possible.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16347' title='16347'>'You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,' said he; 'but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16348' title='16348'>'Why, it is after nine now,' I answered. </span>
<span sid='16349' title='16349'>'I should not be surprised if that were he. </span>
<span sid='16350' title='16350'>I thought I heard a ring.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16351' title='16351'>It was, indeed, our friend the financier. </span>
<span sid='16352' title='16352'>I was shocked by the change which had come over him, for his face, which was naturally of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed to be at least a shade whiter. </span>
<span sid='16353' title='16353'>He entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16354' title='16354'>'I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,' said he. </span>
<span sid='16355' title='16355'>'Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in the world. </span>
<span sid='16356' title='16356'>Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. </span>
<span sid='16357' title='16357'>One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. </span>
<span sid='16358' title='16358'>My niece Mary has deserted me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16359' title='16359'>'Deserted you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16360' title='16360'>'Yes. </span>
<span sid='16361' title='16361'>Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and a note lay for me upon the hall table. </span>
<span sid='16362' title='16362'>I had said to her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him. </span>
<span sid='16363' title='16363'>Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so. </span>
<span sid='16364' title='16364'>It is to that remark that she refers in this note:</span>
<p>
<span sid='16365' title='16365'>My Dearest Uncle - I feel that I have brought this trouble upon you, and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred. </span>
<span sid='16366' title='16366'>I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you for ever. </span>
<span sid='16367' title='16367'>Do not worry about my future, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless labour, and an ill service to me. </span>
<span sid='16368' title='16368'>In life or in death, I am ever your loving,</span>
<p>
<span sid='16369' title='16369'>MARY</span>
<p>
<span sid='16370' title='16370'>'What could she mean by that note, Mr Holmes? </span>
<span sid='16371' title='16371'>Do you think it points to suicide?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16372' title='16372'>'No, no, nothing of the kind. </span>
<span sid='16373' title='16373'>It is perhaps the best possible solution. </span>
<span sid='16374' title='16374'>I trust, Mr Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16375' title='16375'>'Ha! </span>
<span sid='16376' title='16376'>You say so! </span>
<span sid='16377' title='16377'>You have heard something, Mr Holmes: you have learned something! </span>
<span sid='16378' title='16378'>Where are the gems?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16379' title='16379'>'You would not think a thousand pounds apiece an excessive sum for them?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16380' title='16380'>'I would pay ten.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16381' title='16381'>'That would be unnecessary. </span>
<span sid='16382' title='16382'>Three thousand will cover the matter. </span>
<span sid='16383' title='16383'>And there is a little reward, I fancy. </span>
<span sid='16384' title='16384'>Have you your cheque-book? </span>
<span sid='16385' title='16385'>Here is a pen. </span>
<span sid='16386' title='16386'>Better make it out for four thousand pounds.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16387' title='16387'>With a dazed face the banker made out the required cheque. </span>
<span sid='16388' title='16388'>Holmes walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16389' title='16389'>With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16390' title='16390'>'You have it?' he gasped. </span>
<span sid='16391' title='16391'>'I am saved! </span>
<span sid='16392' title='16392'>I am saved!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16393' title='16393'>The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16394' title='16394'>'There is one other thing you owe, Mr Holder,' said Sherlock Holmes, rather sternly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16395' title='16395'>'Owe!' </span>
<span sid='16396' title='16396'>He caught up a pen. </span>
<span sid='16397' title='16397'>'Name the sum, and I will pay it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16398' title='16398'>'No, the debt is not to me. </span>
<span sid='16399' title='16399'>You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16400' title='16400'>'Then it was not Arthur who took them?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16401' title='16401'>'I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16402' title='16402'>'You are sure of it! </span>
<span sid='16403' title='16403'>Then let us hurry to him at once, to let him know that the truth is known.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16404' title='16404'>'He knows it already. </span>
<span sid='16405' title='16405'>When I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him, and, finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was right, and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me. </span>
<span sid='16406' title='16406'>Your news of this morning, however, may open his lips.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16407' title='16407'>'For Heaven's sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16408' title='16408'>'I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it. </span>
<span sid='16409' title='16409'>And let me say to you, first, what it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear. </span>
<span sid='16410' title='16410'>There has been an understanding between Sir George Burnwell and your niece, Mary. </span>
<span sid='16411' title='16411'>They have now fled together.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16412' title='16412'>'My Mary? </span>
<span sid='16413' title='16413'>Impossible!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16414' title='16414'>'It is, unfortunately, more than possible; it is certain. </span>
<span sid='16415' title='16415'>Neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle. </span>
<span sid='16416' title='16416'>He is one of the most dangerous men in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> - a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain; a man without heart or conscience. </span>
<span sid='16417' title='16417'>Your niece knew nothing of such men.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16418' title='16418'>When he breathed his vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart. </span>
<span sid='16419' title='16419'>The devil knows best what he said, but at last she became his tool, and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16420' title='16420'>'I cannot, and I will not, believe it!' cried the banker with an ashen face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16421' title='16421'>'I will tell you, then, what occured in your house that night. </span>
<span sid='16422' title='16422'>Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane. </span>
<span sid='16423' title='16423'>His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he stood there. </span>
<span sid='16424' title='16424'>She told him of the coronet. </span>
<span sid='16425' title='16425'>His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. </span>
<span sid='16426' title='16426'>I have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one. </span>
<span sid='16427' title='16427'>She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly, and told you about one of the servants' escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was all perfectly true.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16428' title='16428'>'Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you, but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts. </span>
<span sid='16429' title='16429'>In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose, and looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage, until she disappeared into your dressing-room. </span>
<span sid='16430' title='16430'>Petrified with astonishment the lad slipped on some clothes, and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair. </span>
<span sid='16431' title='16431'>Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the light of the passage lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. </span>
<span sid='16432' title='16432'>She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. </span>
<span sid='16433' title='16433'>He saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16434' title='16434'>'As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. </span>
<span sid='16435' title='16435'>But the instant she was gone he realized how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it right. </span>
<span sid='16436' title='16436'>He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. </span>
<span sid='16437' title='16437'>Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. </span>
<span sid='16438' title='16438'>In the scuffle, your son struck Sir George, and cut him over the eye. </span>
<span sid='16439' title='16439'>Then something suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle, and was endeavouring to straighten it, when you appeared upon the scene.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16440' title='16440'>'Is it possible?' gasped the banker.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16441' title='16441'>'You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. </span>
<span sid='16442' title='16442'>He could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying the one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. </span>
<span sid='16443' title='16443'>He took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her secret.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16444' title='16444'>'And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,' cried Mr Holder. </span>
<span sid='16445' title='16445'>'Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have been. </span>
<span sid='16446' title='16446'>And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! </span>
<span sid='16447' title='16447'>The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. </span>
<span sid='16448' title='16448'>How cruelly I have misjudged him!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16449' title='16449'>'When I arrived at the house,' continued Holmes, 'I at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me. </span>
<span sid='16450' title='16450'>I knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. </span>
<span sid='16451' title='16451'>I passed along the tradesmen's path, but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. </span>
<span sid='16452' title='16452'>Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impression on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. </span>
<span sid='16453' title='16453'>I could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel-marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away. </span>
<span sid='16454' title='16454'>I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweet-heart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. </span>
<span sid='16455' title='16455'>I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16456' title='16456'>'There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. </span>
<span sid='16457' title='16457'>I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son. </span>
<span sid='16458' title='16458'>The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and, as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other. </span>
<span sid='16459' title='16459'>I followed them up, and found that they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. </span>
<span sid='16460' title='16460'>Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more down the lane. </span>
<span sid='16461' title='16461'>I saw where Boots had faced round, where the snow was cut up, as though there had been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not mistaken. </span>
<span sid='16462' title='16462'>Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. </span>
<span sid='16463' title='16463'>When he came to the high-road at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16464' title='16464'>'On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see that someone had passed out. </span>
<span sid='16465' title='16465'>I could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. </span>
<span sid='16466' title='16466'>I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. </span>
<span sid='16467' title='16467'>A man had waited outside the window, someone had brought him the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son, he had pursued the thief, had struggled with him, they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. </span>
<span sid='16468' title='16468'>He had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. </span>
<span sid='16469' title='16469'>So far I was clear. </span>
<span sid='16470' title='16470'>The question now was, who was the man, and who was it brought him the coronet?</span>
<p>
<span sid='16471' title='16471'>'It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. </span>
<span sid='16472' title='16472'>Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece and the maids. </span>
<span sid='16473' title='16473'>But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place? </span>
<span sid='16474' title='16474'>There could be no possible reason. </span>
<span sid='16475' title='16475'>As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret - the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. </span>
<span sid='16476' title='16476'>When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16477' title='16477'>'And who could it be who was her confederate? </span>
<span sid='16478' title='16478'>A lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you? </span>
<span sid='16479' title='16479'>I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very limited one. </span>
<span sid='16480' title='16480'>But among them was Sir George Burnwell. </span>
<span sid='16481' title='16481'>I had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. </span>
<span sid='16482' title='16482'>It must have been he who wore those boots, and retained the missing gems. </span>
<span sid='16483' title='16483'>Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16484' title='16484'>'Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. </span>
<span sid='16485' title='16485'>I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George's house, managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his head the night before, and finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. </span>
<span sid='16486' title='16486'>With those I journeyed down to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Streatham&t=h'>Streatham</a>, and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16487' title='16487'>'I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,' said Mr Holder.</span>
<p>
<span sid='16488' title='16488'>'Precisely. </span>
<span sid='16489' title='16489'>It was I. </span>
<span sid='16490' title='16490'>I found that I had my man, so I came home and changed my clothes. </span>
<span sid='16491' title='16491'>It was a delicate part which I had to play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. </span>
<span sid='16492' title='16492'>I went and saw him. </span>
<span sid='16493' title='16493'>At first, of course, he denied everything. </span>
<span sid='16494' title='16494'>But when I gave him every particular that had occured, he tried to bluster, and took down a life-preserver from the wall. </span>
<span sid='16495' title='16495'>I knew my man, however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. </span>
<span sid='16496' title='16496'>Then he became a little more reasonable. </span>
<span sid='16497' title='16497'>I told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held - a thousand pounds apiece. </span>
<span sid='16498' title='16498'>That brought out the first signs of grief he had shown. </span>
<span sid='16499' title='16499'>"Why, dash it all!" said he, "I've let them go at six hundred for the three!" </span>
<span sid='16500' title='16500'>I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. </span>
<span sid='16501' title='16501'>Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at a thousand apiece. </span>
<span sid='16502' title='16502'>Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o'clock after what I may call a really hard day's work.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16503' title='16503'>'A day which has saved <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> from a great public scandal,' said the banker, rising. </span>
<span sid='16504' title='16504'>'Sir, I canot find words to thank you. </span>
<span sid='16505' title='16505'>But you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. </span>
<span sid='16506' title='16506'>Your skill has indeed exceeded all that I have ever heard of it. </span>
<span sid='16507' title='16507'>And now I must fly to my dear boy to apologize to him for the wrong which I have done him. </span>
<span sid='16508' title='16508'>As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my heart. </span>
<span sid='16509' title='16509'>Not even your skill can inform me where she is now.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='16510' title='16510'>'I think that we may safely say,' returned Holmes, 'that she is wherever Sir George Burnwell is. </span>
<span sid='16511' title='16511'>It is equally certain, too, that whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment.'</span>
