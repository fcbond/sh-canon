<p>
<span sid='28551' title='28551'>Shortly after my marriage I had bought a connection in the Paddington district. </span>
<span sid='28552' title='28552'>Old Mr Farquhar, from whom I purchased it, had at one time an excellent general practice, but his age, and an affliction of the nature of St Vitus's Dance from which he suffered, had very much thinned it. </span>
<span sid='28553' title='28553'>The public, not unnaturally, goes upon the principle that he who would heal others must himself be whole, and looks askance at the curative powers of the man whose own case is beyond the reach of his drugs. </span>
<span sid='28554' title='28554'>Thus, as my predecessor weakened, his practice declined, until when I purchased it from him it had sunk from twelve hundred to little more than three hundred a year. </span>
<span sid='28555' title='28555'>I had confidence, however, in my own youth and energy, and was convinced that in a very few years the concern would be as flourishing as ever.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28556' title='28556'>For three months after taking over the practice I was kept very closely at work, and saw little of my friend Sherlock Holmes, for I was too busy to visit <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>, and he seldom went anywhere himself save upon professional business. </span>
<span sid='28557' title='28557'>I was surprised, therefore, when one morning in June, as I sat reading the British Medical Journal after breakfast, I heard a ring at the bell followed by the high, somewhat strident, tones of my old companion's voice.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28558' title='28558'>'Ah, my dear Watson,' said he, striding into the room, 'I am very delighted to see you. </span>
<span sid='28559' title='28559'>I trust that Mrs Watson has entirely recovered from all the little excitements connected with our adventure of the "Sign of Four" ?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28560' title='28560'>'Thank you, we are both very well,' said I, shaking him warmly by the hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28561' title='28561'>'And I hope also,' he continued, sitting down in the rocking-chair, 'that the cares of medical practice have not entirely obliterated the interest which you used to take in our little deductive problems.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28562' title='28562'>'On the contrary,' I answered, 'it was only last night that I was looking over my old notes and classifying some of our past results.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28563' title='28563'>'I trust that you don't consider your collection closed?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28564' title='28564'>'Not at all. </span>
<span sid='28565' title='28565'>I should wish nothing better than to have some more of such experiences.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28566' title='28566'>'To-day, for example?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28567' title='28567'>'Yes, to-day, if you like.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28568' title='28568'>'And as far off as <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Birmingham&t=h'>Birmingham</a>?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28569' title='28569'>'Certainly, if you wish it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28570' title='28570'>'And the practice?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28571' title='28571'>'I do my neighbour's when he goes. </span>
<span sid='28572' title='28572'>He is always ready to work off the debt.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28573' title='28573'>'Ha! </span>
<span sid='28574' title='28574'>Nothing could be better!' said Holmes, leaning back in his chair and looking keenly at me from under his half-closed lids. </span>
<span sid='28575' title='28575'>'I perceive that you have been unwell lately. </span>
<span sid='28576' title='28576'>Summer colds are always a little trying.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28577' title='28577'>'I was confined to the house by a severe chill for three days last week. </span>
<span sid='28578' title='28578'>I thought, however, that I had cast off every trace of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28579' title='28579'>'So you have. </span>
<span sid='28580' title='28580'>You look remarkably robust.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28581' title='28581'>'How, then, did you know of it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28582' title='28582'>'My dear fellow, you know my methods.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28583' title='28583'>'You deduced it, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28584' title='28584'>'Certainly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28585' title='28585'>'And from what?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28586' title='28586'>'From your slippers.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28587' title='28587'>I glanced down at the new patent leathers which I was wearing. </span>
<span sid='28588' title='28588'>'How on earth-?' </span>
<span sid='28589' title='28589'>I began, but Holmes answered my question before it was asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28590' title='28590'>'Your slippers are new,' he said. </span>
<span sid='28591' title='28591'>'You could not have had them more than a few weeks. </span>
<span sid='28592' title='28592'>The soles which you are at this moment presenting to me are slightly scorched. </span>
<span sid='28593' title='28593'>For a moment I thought they might have got wet and been burned in the drying. </span>
<span sid='28594' title='28594'>But near the instep there is a small circular wafer of paper with the shopman's hieroglyphics upon it. </span>
<span sid='28595' title='28595'>Damp would of course have removed this. </span>
<span sid='28596' title='28596'>You had then been sitting with your feet outstretched to the fire, which a man would hardly do even in so wet a June as this if he were in his full health.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28597' title='28597'>Like all Holmes's reasoning the thing seemed simplicity itself when it was once explained. </span>
<span sid='28598' title='28598'>He read the thought upon my features, and his smile had a tinge of bitterness.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28599' title='28599'>'I am afraid that I rather give myself away when I explain,' said he. </span>
<span sid='28600' title='28600'>'Results without causes are much more impressive. </span>
<span sid='28601' title='28601'>You are ready to come to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Birmingham&t=h'>Birmingham</a>, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28602' title='28602'>'Certainly. </span>
<span sid='28603' title='28603'>What is the case?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28604' title='28604'>'You shall hear it all in the train. </span>
<span sid='28605' title='28605'>My client is outside in a four-wheeler. </span>
<span sid='28606' title='28606'>Can you come at once?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28607' title='28607'>'In an instant.' </span>
<span sid='28608' title='28608'>I scribbled a note to my neighbour, rushed upstairs to explain the matter to my wife, and joined Holmes upon the doorstep.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28609' title='28609'>'Your neighbour is a doctor?' said he, nodding at the brass plate.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28610' title='28610'>'Yes. </span>
<span sid='28611' title='28611'>He bought a practice as I did.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28612' title='28612'>'An old-established one?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28613' title='28613'>'Just the same as mine. </span>
<span sid='28614' title='28614'>Both have been ever since the houses were built.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28615' title='28615'>'Ah, then you got hold of the best of the two.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28616' title='28616'>'I think I did. </span>
<span sid='28617' title='28617'>But how do you know?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28618' title='28618'>'By the steps, my boy. </span>
<span sid='28619' title='28619'>Yours are worn three inches deeper than his. </span>
<span sid='28620' title='28620'>But this gentleman in the cab is my client, Mr Hall Pycroft. </span>
<span sid='28621' title='28621'>Allow me to introduce you to him. </span>
<span sid='28622' title='28622'>Whip your horse up, cabby, for we have only just time to catch our train.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28623' title='28623'>The man whom I found myself facing was a well-built, fresh-complexioned young fellow with a frank, honest face and a slight, crisp, yellow moustache. </span>
<span sid='28624' title='28624'>He wore a very shiny top-hat and a neat suit of sober black, which made him look what he was - a smart young City man, of the class who have been labelled Cockneys, but who give us our crack Volunteer regiments, and who turn out more fine athletes and sportsmen than any body of men in these islands. </span>
<span sid='28625' title='28625'>His round, ruddy face was naturally full of cheeriness, but the corners of his mouth seemed to me to be pulled down in a half-comical distress. </span>
<span sid='28626' title='28626'>It was not, however, until we were an in a first-class carriage and well started upon our journey to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Birmingham&t=h'>Birmingham</a>, that I was able to learn what the trouble was which had driven him to Sherlock Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28627' title='28627'>'We have a clear run here of seventy minutes,' Holmes remarked. </span>
<span sid='28628' title='28628'>'I want you, Mr Hall Pycroft, to tell my friend your very interesting experience exactly as you have told it to me, or with more detail if possible. </span>
<span sid='28629' title='28629'>It will be of use to me to hear the succession of events again. </span>
<span sid='28630' title='28630'>It is a case, Watson, which may prove to have something in it, or may prove to have nothing, but which at least presents those unusual and outri features which are as dear to you as they are to me. </span>
<span sid='28631' title='28631'>Now, Mr Pycroft, I shall not interrupt you again.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28632' title='28632'>Our young companion looked at me with a twinkle in his eye.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28633' title='28633'>'The worst of the story is,' said he, 'that I show myself up as such a confounded fool. </span>
<span sid='28634' title='28634'>Of course, it may work out all right, and I don't see that I could have done otherwise, but if I have lost my crib and get nothing in exchange, I shall feel what a soft Johnny I have been. </span>
<span sid='28635' title='28635'>I'm not very good at telling a story, Dr Watson, but it is like this with me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28636' title='28636'>'I used to have a billet at Coxon and Woodhouse, of Drapers' Gardens, but they were let in early in the spring through the Venezuelan loan, as no doubt you remember, and came a nasty cropper. </span>
<span sid='28637' title='28637'>I had been with them five years, and old Coxon gave me a ripping good testimonial when the smash came, but, of course, we clerks were all turned adrift, the twenty-seven of us. </span>
<span sid='28638' title='28638'>I tried here and tried there, but there were lots of other chaps on the same lay as myself, and it was a perfect frost for a long time. </span>
<span sid='28639' title='28639'>I had been taking three pounds a week at Coxon's, and I had saved about seventy of them, but I soon worked my way through that and out at the other end. </span>
<span sid='28640' title='28640'>I was fairly at the end of my tether at last, and could hardly find the stamps to answer the advertisements or the envelopes to stick them to. </span>
<span sid='28641' title='28641'>I had worn out my boots padding up office stairs, and I seemed just as far from getting a billet as ever.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28642' title='28642'>'At last I saw a vacancy at Mawson and Williams', the great stockbroking firm in Lombard Street. </span>
<span sid='28643' title='28643'>I dare say EC is not much in your line, but I can tell you that this is about the richest house in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='28644' title='28644'>The advertisement was to be answered by letter only. </span>
<span sid='28645' title='28645'>I sent in my testimonial and application, but without the least hope of getting it. </span>
<span sid='28646' title='28646'>Back came an answer by return saying that if I would appear next Monday I might take over my new duties at once, provided that my appearance was satisfactory. </span>
<span sid='28647' title='28647'>No one knows how these things are worked. </span>
<span sid='28648' title='28648'>Some people say the manager just plunges his hand into the heap and takes the first that comes. </span>
<span sid='28649' title='28649'>Anyhow, it was my innings that time, and I don't ever wish to feel better pleased. </span>
<span sid='28650' title='28650'>The screw was a pound a week rise, and the duties just about the same as at Coxon's.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28651' title='28651'>'And now I come to the queer part of the business. </span>
<span sid='28652' title='28652'>I was in diggings out <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Hampstead&t=h'>Hampstead</a> way - 17, Potter's Terrace, was the address. </span>
<span sid='28653' title='28653'>Well, I was sitting doing a smoke that very evening after I had been promised the appointment, when up came my landlady with a card which had "Arthur <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pinner&t=h'>Pinner</a>, financial agent," printed upon it. </span>
<span sid='28654' title='28654'>I had never heard the name before, and could not imagine what he wanted with me, but of course I asked her to show him up. </span>
<span sid='28655' title='28655'>In he walked-a middle-sized, dark-haired, dark-eyed, black-bearded man, with a touch of the sheeny about his nose. </span>
<span sid='28656' title='28656'>He had a brisk kind of way with him and spoke sharply, like a man that knew the value of time.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28657' title='28657'>'"Mr Hall Pycroft, I believe?" said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28658' title='28658'>'"Yes, sir," I answered, and pushed a chair towards him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28659' title='28659'>'"Lately engaged at Coxon and Woodhouse's?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='28660' title='28660'>'"Yes, sir."</span>
<p>
<span sid='28661' title='28661'>'"And now on the staff of Mawson's?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='28662' title='28662'>'"Quite so."</span>
<p>
<span sid='28663' title='28663'>'"Well," said he. </span>
<span sid='28664' title='28664'>"The fact is that I have heard some really extraordinary stories about your financial ability. </span>
<span sid='28665' title='28665'>You remember Parker who used to be Coxon's manager? </span>
<span sid='28666' title='28666'>He can never say enough about it."</span>
<p>
<span sid='28667' title='28667'>'Of course I was pleased to hear this. </span>
<span sid='28668' title='28668'>I had always been pretty smart in the office, but I had never dreamed that I was talked about in the City in this fashion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28669' title='28669'>'"You have a good memory?" said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28670' title='28670'>'"Pretty fair," I answered, modestly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28671' title='28671'>'"Have you kept in touch with the market while you have been out of work?" he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28672' title='28672'>'"Yes, I read the Stock Exchange List every morning."</span>
<p>
<span sid='28673' title='28673'>'"Now, that shows real application!" he cried. </span>
<span sid='28674' title='28674'>"That is the way to prosper! </span>
<span sid='28675' title='28675'>You won't mind my testing you, will you? </span>
<span sid='28676' title='28676'>Let me see! </span>
<span sid='28677' title='28677'>How are Ayrshires?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='28678' title='28678'>'"One hundred and five, to one hundred and five and a quarter," I answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28679' title='28679'>'"And <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=New Zealand&t=h'>New Zealand</a> Consolidated?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='28680' title='28680'>'"A hundred and four."</span>
<p>
<span sid='28681' title='28681'>'"And British Broken Hills?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='28682' title='28682'>'"Seven to seven and six."</span>
<p>
<span sid='28683' title='28683'>'"Wonderful!" he cried, with his hands up. </span>
<span sid='28684' title='28684'>"This quite fits in with all that I had heard. </span>
<span sid='28685' title='28685'>My boy, my boy, you are very much too good to be a clerk at Mawson's!"</span>
<p>
<span sid='28686' title='28686'>'This outburst rather astonished me, as you can think. </span>
<span sid='28687' title='28687'>"Well," said I, "other people don't think quite so much of me as you seem to do, Mr <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pinner&t=h'>Pinner</a>. </span>
<span sid='28688' title='28688'>I had a hard enough fight to get this berth, and I am very glad to have it."</span>
<p>
<span sid='28689' title='28689'>'"Pooh, man, you should soar above it. </span>
<span sid='28690' title='28690'>You are not in your true sphere. </span>
<span sid='28691' title='28691'>Now, I'll tell you how it stands with me. </span>
<span sid='28692' title='28692'>What I have to offer is little enough when measured by your ability, but when compared with Mawson's it is light to dark. </span>
<span sid='28693' title='28693'>Let me see! </span>
<span sid='28694' title='28694'>When do you go to Mawson's?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='28695' title='28695'>'"On Monday."</span>
<p>
<span sid='28696' title='28696'>'"Ha! ha! </span>
<span sid='28697' title='28697'>I think I would risk a little sporting flutter that you don't go there at all."</span>
<p>
<span sid='28698' title='28698'>'"Not go to Mawson's?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='28699' title='28699'>'"No, sir. </span>
<span sid='28700' title='28700'>By that day you will be the business manager of the Franco-Midland Hardware Company, Limited, with one hundred and thirty-four branches in the towns and villages of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>, not counting one in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brussels&t=h'>Brussels</a> and one in San Remo."</span>
<p>
<span sid='28701' title='28701'>'This took my breath away. </span>
<span sid='28702' title='28702'>"I never heard of it.," said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28703' title='28703'>'"Very likely not. </span>
<span sid='28704' title='28704'>It has been kept very quiet, for the capital was all privately subscribed, and it is too good a thing to let the public into. </span>
<span sid='28705' title='28705'>My brother, Harry <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pinner&t=h'>Pinner</a>, is promoter, and joins the board after allotment as managing director. </span>
<span sid='28706' title='28706'>He knew that I was in the swim down here, and he asked me to pick up a good man cheap - a young pushing man, with plenty of snap about him. </span>
<span sid='28707' title='28707'>Parker spoke of you, and that brought me here tonight. </span>
<span sid='28708' title='28708'>We can only offer you a beggarly five hundred to start with-"</span>
<p>
<span sid='28709' title='28709'>'"Five hundred a year!" I shouted.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28710' title='28710'>'"Only that at the beginning, but you are to have an over-riding commission of I per cent on all business done by your agents, and you may take my word for it that this will come to more than your salary."</span>
<p>
<span sid='28711' title='28711'>'"But I know nothing about hardware."</span>
<p>
<span sid='28712' title='28712'>'"Tut, my boy, you know about figures."</span>
<p>
<span sid='28713' title='28713'>'My head buzzed, and I could hardly sit still in the chair. </span>
<span sid='28714' title='28714'>But suddenly a little chill of doubt came over me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28715' title='28715'>'"I must be frank with you," said I. </span>
<span sid='28716' title='28716'>"Mawson only gives me two hundred, but Mawson is safe. </span>
<span sid='28717' title='28717'>Now, really, I know so little about your company that-"</span>
<p>
<span sid='28718' title='28718'>'"Ah, smart, smart!" he cried, in a kind of ecstasy of delight. </span>
<span sid='28719' title='28719'>"You are the very man for us! </span>
<span sid='28720' title='28720'>You are not to be talked over, and quite right too. </span>
<span sid='28721' title='28721'>Now here's a note for a hundred pounds, and if you think that we can do business you may just slip it into your pocket as an advance upon your salary."</span>
<p>
<span sid='28722' title='28722'>'"That is very handsome," said I. </span>
<span sid='28723' title='28723'>"When shall I take over my new duties?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='28724' title='28724'>'"Be in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Birmingham&t=h'>Birmingham</a> tomorrow at one," said he. </span>
<span sid='28725' title='28725'>"I have a note in my pocket here which you will take to my brother. </span>
<span sid='28726' title='28726'>You will find him at 126B, Corporation Street, where the temporary offices of the company are situated. </span>
<span sid='28727' title='28727'>Of course he must confirm your engagement, but between ourselves it will be all right."</span>
<p>
<span sid='28728' title='28728'>'"Really, I hardly know how to express my gratitude, Mr <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pinner&t=h'>Pinner</a>," said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28729' title='28729'>'"Not at all, my boy. </span>
<span sid='28730' title='28730'>You have only got your deserts. </span>
<span sid='28731' title='28731'>There are one or two small things - mere formalities - which I must arrange with you. </span>
<span sid='28732' title='28732'>You have a bit of paper beside you there. </span>
<span sid='28733' title='28733'>Kindly write upon it, 'I am perfectly willing to act as business manager to the Franco-Midland Hardware Company, Limited, at a minimum salary of Â£500."'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28734' title='28734'>'I did as he asked, and he put the paper in his pocket.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28735' title='28735'>'"There is one other detail," said he. </span>
<span sid='28736' title='28736'>"What do you intend to do about Mawson's?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='28737' title='28737'>'I had forgotten all about Mawson's in my joy.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28738' title='28738'>'"I'll write and resign," said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28739' title='28739'>'"Precisely what I don't want you to do. </span>
<span sid='28740' title='28740'>I had a row over you with Mawson's manager. </span>
<span sid='28741' title='28741'>I had gone up to ask him about you, and he was very offensive - accused me of coaxing you away from the service of the firm, and that sort of thing. </span>
<span sid='28742' title='28742'>At last I fairly lost my temper. </span>
<span sid='28743' title='28743'>'If you want good men you should pay them a good price,' said I. </span>
<span sid='28744' title='28744'>'He would rather have our small price than your big one,' said he. </span>
<span sid='28745' title='28745'>'I'll lay you a fiver,' said I, 'that when he has my offer you will never so much as hear from him again. </span>
<span sid='28746' title='28746'>Done!' said he. </span>
<span sid='28747' title='28747'>'We picked him out of the gutter, and he won't leave us so easily.' </span>
<span sid='28748' title='28748'>Those were his very words."</span>
<p>
<span sid='28749' title='28749'>'"The impudent scoundrel!" I cried. </span>
<span sid='28750' title='28750'>"I've never so much as seen him in my life. </span>
<span sid='28751' title='28751'>Why should I consider him in any way? </span>
<span sid='28752' title='28752'>I shall certainly not write if you would rather that I didn't."</span>
<p>
<span sid='28753' title='28753'>'"Good! </span>
<span sid='28754' title='28754'>That's a promise!" said he, rising from his chair. </span>
<span sid='28755' title='28755'>"Well, I am delighted to have got so good a man for my brother. </span>
<span sid='28756' title='28756'>Here is your advance of a hundred pounds, and here is the letter. </span>
<span sid='28757' title='28757'>Make a note of the address, 126B, Corporation Street, and remember that one o'clock tomorrow is your appointment. </span>
<span sid='28758' title='28758'>Good-night, and may you have all the fortune that you deserve."</span>
<p>
<span sid='28759' title='28759'>'That's just about all that passed between us as near as I can remember it. </span>
<span sid='28760' title='28760'>You can imagine, Dr Watson, how pleased I was at such an extraordinary bit of good fortune. </span>
<span sid='28761' title='28761'>I sat up half the night hugging myself over it, and next day I was off to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Birmingham&t=h'>Birmingham</a> in a train that would take me in plenty of time for my appointment. </span>
<span sid='28762' title='28762'>I took my things to an hotel in New Street, and then I made my way to the address which had been given me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28763' title='28763'>'It was a quarter of an hour before my time, but I thought that would make no difference. </span>
<span sid='28764' title='28764'>126B was a passage between two large shops which led to a winding stone stair, from which there were many flats, let as offices to companies or professional men. </span>
<span sid='28765' title='28765'>The names of the occupants were painted up at the bottom on the wall, but there was no such name as the Franco-Midland Hardware Company, Limited. </span>
<span sid='28766' title='28766'>I stood for a few minutes with my heart in my boots, wondering whether the whole thing was an elaborate hoax or not, when up came a man and addressed me. </span>
<span sid='28767' title='28767'>He was very like the chap that I had seen the night before, the same figure and voice, but he was clean shaven and his hair was lighter.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28768' title='28768'>'"Are you Mr Hall Pycroft?" he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28769' title='28769'>'"Yes," said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28770' title='28770'>"Ah! </span>
<span sid='28771' title='28771'>I was expecting you, but you are a trifle before your time. </span>
<span sid='28772' title='28772'>I had a note from my brother this morning, in which he sang your praises very loudly."</span>
<p>
<span sid='28773' title='28773'>'"I was just looking for the offices when you came."</span>
<p>
<span sid='28774' title='28774'>'"We have not got our name up yet, for we only secured these temporary premises last week. </span>
<span sid='28775' title='28775'>Come up with me and we will talk the matter over."</span>
<p>
<span sid='28776' title='28776'>'I followed him to the top of a very lofty stair, and there right under the slates were a couple of empty and dusty little rooms, uncarpeted and uncurtained, into which he led me. </span>
<span sid='28777' title='28777'>I had thought of a great office with shining tables and rows of clerks such as I was used to, and I dare say I stared rather straight at the two deal chairs and one little table, which, with a ledger and a waste-paper basket, made up the whole furniture.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28778' title='28778'>'"Don't be disheartened, Mr Pycroft," said my new acquaintance, seeing the length of my face. </span>
<span sid='28779' title='28779'>"Rome was not built in a day, and we have lots of money at our backs, though we don't cut much dash yet in offices. </span>
<span sid='28780' title='28780'>Pray sit down and let me have your letter."</span>
<p>
<span sid='28781' title='28781'>'I gave it to him, and he read it over very carefully.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28782' title='28782'>'"You seem to have made a vast impression upon my brother, Arthur," said he, "and I know that he is a pretty shrewd judge. </span>
<span sid='28783' title='28783'>He swears by <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, you know, and I by <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Birmingham&t=h'>Birmingham</a>, but this time I shall follow his advice. </span>
<span sid='28784' title='28784'>Pray consider yourself definitely engaged."</span>
<p>
<span sid='28785' title='28785'>'"What are my duties?" I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28786' title='28786'>'"You will eventually manage the great depÃ´t in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Paris&t=h'>Paris</a>, which will pour a flood of English crockery into the shops of one hundred and thirty-four agents in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>. </span>
<span sid='28787' title='28787'>The purchase will be completed in a week, and meanwhile you will remain in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Birmingham&t=h'>Birmingham</a> and make yourself useful."</span>
<p>
<span sid='28788' title='28788'>'"How?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='28789' title='28789'>'For answer he took a big red book out of a drawer. </span>
<span sid='28790' title='28790'>"This is a directory of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Paris&t=h'>Paris</a>," said he, "with the trades after the names of the people. </span>
<span sid='28791' title='28791'>I want you to take it home with you, and to mark off all the hardware sellers with their addresses. </span>
<span sid='28792' title='28792'>It would be of the greatest use to me to have them."</span>
<p>
<span sid='28793' title='28793'>'"Surely there are classified lists?" I suggested.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28794' title='28794'>'"Not reliable ones. </span>
<span sid='28795' title='28795'>Their system is different to ours. </span>
<span sid='28796' title='28796'>Stick at it and let me have the lists by Monday, at twelve. </span>
<span sid='28797' title='28797'>Good day, Mr Pycroft, if you continue to show zeal and intelligence, you will find the company a good master."</span>
<p>
<span sid='28798' title='28798'>'I went back to the hotel with the big book under my arm, and with very conflicting feelings in my breast. </span>
<span sid='28799' title='28799'>On the one' hand I was definitely engaged, and had a hundred pounds in my pocket. </span>
<span sid='28800' title='28800'>On the other, the look of the offices, the absence of name on the wall, and other of the points which would strike a business man had left a bad impression as to the position of my employers. </span>
<span sid='28801' title='28801'>However, come what might, I had my money, so I settled down to my task. </span>
<span sid='28802' title='28802'>All Sunday I was kept hard at work, and yet by Monday I had only got as far as H. </span>
<span sid='28803' title='28803'>I went round to my employer, found him in the same dismantled kind of room, and was told to keep at it until Wednesday, and then come again. </span>
<span sid='28804' title='28804'>On Wednesday it was still unfinished, so I hammered away until Friday - that is, yesterday. </span>
<span sid='28805' title='28805'>Then I brought it round to Mr Harry <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pinner&t=h'>Pinner</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28806' title='28806'>'"Thank you very much," said he. </span>
<span sid='28807' title='28807'>"I fear that I underrated the difficulty of the task. </span>
<span sid='28808' title='28808'>This list will be of very material assistance to me."</span>
<p>
<span sid='28809' title='28809'>'"It took some time," said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28810' title='28810'>'"And now," said he, "I want you to make a list of the furniture shops, for they all sell crockery."</span>
<p>
<span sid='28811' title='28811'>'"Very good."</span>
<p>
<span sid='28812' title='28812'>'"And you can come up to-morrow evening at seven, and let me know how you are getting on. </span>
<span sid='28813' title='28813'>Don't overwork yourself. </span>
<span sid='28814' title='28814'>A couple of hours at Day's Music-Hall in the evening would do you no harm after your labours." </span>
<span sid='28815' title='28815'>He laughed as he spoke, and I saw with a thrill that his second tooth upon the left-hand side had been very badly stuffed with gold.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28816' title='28816'>Sherlock Holmes rubbed his hands with delight, and I stared in astonishment at our client.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28817' title='28817'>'You may well look surprised, Dr Watson, but it is this way,' said he. </span>
<span sid='28818' title='28818'>'When I was speaking to the other chap in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> at the time that he laughed at my not going to Mawson's, I happened to notice that his tooth was stuffed in this very identical fashion. </span>
<span sid='28819' title='28819'>The glint of the gold in each case caught my eye, you see. </span>
<span sid='28820' title='28820'>When I put that with the voice and figure being the same, and only those things altered which might be changed by a razor or a wig, I could not doubt that it was the same man. </span>
<span sid='28821' title='28821'>Of course, you expect two brothers to be alike, but not that they should have the same tooth stuffed in the same way. </span>
<span sid='28822' title='28822'>He bowed me out and I found myself in the street, hardly knowing whether I was on my head or my heels. </span>
<span sid='28823' title='28823'>Back I went to my hotel, put my head in a basin of cold water, and tried to think it out. </span>
<span sid='28824' title='28824'>Why had he sent me from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Birmingham&t=h'>Birmingham</a>, why had he got there before me, and why had he written a letter from himself to himself? </span>
<span sid='28825' title='28825'>It was altogether too much for me, and I could make no sense of it. </span>
<span sid='28826' title='28826'>And then suddenly it struck me that what was dark to me might be very light to Mr Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='28827' title='28827'>I had just time to get up to town by the night train, to see him this morning, and to bring you both back with me to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Birmingham&t=h'>Birmingham</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28828' title='28828'>There was a pause after the stockbroker's clerk had concluded his surprising experience. </span>
<span sid='28829' title='28829'>Then Sherlock Holmes cocked his eye at me, leaning back on the cushions with a pleased and yet critical face, like a connoisseur who had just taken his first sip of a comet vintage.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28830' title='28830'>'Rather fine, Watson, is it not?' said he. </span>
<span sid='28831' title='28831'>'There are points in it which please me. </span>
<span sid='28832' title='28832'>I think you will agree with me that an interview with Mr Arthur Harry <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pinner&t=h'>Pinner</a> in the temporary offices of the Franco-Midland Hardware Company, Limited, would be a rather interesting experience for both of us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28833' title='28833'>'But how can we do it?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28834' title='28834'>'Oh, easily enough,' said Hall Pycroft, cheerily. </span>
<span sid='28835' title='28835'>'You are two friends of mine who are in want of a billet, and what could be more natural than that I should bring you both round to the managing director?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28836' title='28836'>'Quite so! </span>
<span sid='28837' title='28837'>Of course!' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='28838' title='28838'>'I should like to have a look at the gentleman and see if I can make anything of his little game. </span>
<span sid='28839' title='28839'>What qualities have you, my friend, which would make your services so valuable? or is it possible that-' </span>
<span sid='28840' title='28840'>He began biting his nails and staring blankly out of the window, and we hardly drew another word from him until we were in New Street.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28841' title='28841'>At seven o'clock that evening we were walking, the three of us, down Corporation Street to the company's offices.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28842' title='28842'>'It is of no use our being at all before our time,' said our client. </span>
<span sid='28843' title='28843'>'He only comes there to see me apparently, for the place is deserted up to the very hour he names.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28844' title='28844'>'That is suggestive,' remarked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28845' title='28845'>'By Jove, I told you so!' cried the clerk. </span>
<span sid='28846' title='28846'>'That's he walking ahead of us there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28847' title='28847'>He pointed to a smallish, blond, well-dressed man, who was bustling along the other side of the road. </span>
<span sid='28848' title='28848'>As we watched him he looked across at a boy who was bawling out the latest edition of the evening paper, and, running over among the cabs and 'buses, he bought one from him. </span>
<span sid='28849' title='28849'>Then clutching it in his hand he vanished through a doorway.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28850' title='28850'>'There he goes!' cried Hall Pycroft. </span>
<span sid='28851' title='28851'>'Those are the company's offices into which he has gone. </span>
<span sid='28852' title='28852'>Come with me and I'll fix it up as easily as possible.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28853' title='28853'>Following his lead we ascended five stories, until we found ourselves outside a half-opened door, at which our client tapped. </span>
<span sid='28854' title='28854'>A voice within bade us 'come in,' and we entered a bare, unfurnished room, such as Hall Pycroft had described. </span>
<span sid='28855' title='28855'>At the single table sat the man whom we had seen in the street, with his evening paper spread out in front of him, and as he looked up at us it seemed to me that I had never looked upon a face which bore such marks of grief, and of something beyond grief - of a horror such as comes to few men in a lifetime. </span>
<span sid='28856' title='28856'>His brow glistened with perspiration, his cheeks were of the dull dead white of a fish's belly, and his eyes were wild and staring. </span>
<span sid='28857' title='28857'>He looked at his clerk as though he failed to recognize him, and I could see, by the astonishment depicted upon our conductor's face, that this was by no means the usual appearance of his employer.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28858' title='28858'>'You look ill, Mr <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pinner&t=h'>Pinner</a>,' he exclaimed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28859' title='28859'>'Yes, I am not very well,' answered the other, making obvious efforts to pull himself together, and licking his dry lips before he spoke. </span>
<span sid='28860' title='28860'>'Who are these gentlemen whom you have brought with you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28861' title='28861'>'One is Mr Harris, of Bermondsey, and the other is Mr Price, of this town,' said our clerk glibly. </span>
<span sid='28862' title='28862'>'They are friends of mine, and gentlemen of experience, but they have been out of a place for some little time, and they hoped that perhaps you might find an opening for them in the company's employment.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28863' title='28863'>'Very possibly! </span>
<span sid='28864' title='28864'>Very possibly!' cried Mr <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pinner&t=h'>Pinner</a>, with a ghastly smile. </span>
<span sid='28865' title='28865'>'Yes, I have no doubt that we shall be able to do something for you. </span>
<span sid='28866' title='28866'>What is your particular line, Mr Harris?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28867' title='28867'>'I am an accountant,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28868' title='28868'>'Ah, yes, we shall want something of the sort. </span>
<span sid='28869' title='28869'>And you, Mr Price?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28870' title='28870'>'A clerk,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28871' title='28871'>'I have every hope that the company may accommodate you. </span>
<span sid='28872' title='28872'>I will let you know about it as soon as we come to any conclusion. </span>
<span sid='28873' title='28873'>And now I beg that you will go. </span>
<span sid='28874' title='28874'>For God's sake, leave me to myself!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28875' title='28875'>These last words were shot out of him, as though the constraint which he was evidently setting upon himself had suddenly and utterly burst asunder. </span>
<span sid='28876' title='28876'>Holmes and I glanced at each other, and Hall Pycroft took a step towards the table.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28877' title='28877'>'You forget, Mr <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pinner&t=h'>Pinner</a>, that I am here by appointment to receive some directions from you,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28878' title='28878'>'Certainly, Mr Pycroft, certainly,' the other answered in a calmer tone. </span>
<span sid='28879' title='28879'>'You may wait here a moment, and there is no reason why your friends should not wait with you. </span>
<span sid='28880' title='28880'>I will be entirely at your service in three minutes, if I might trespass upon your patience so far.' </span>
<span sid='28881' title='28881'>He rose with a very courteous air, and bowing to us he passed out through a door at the further end of the room, which he closed behind him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28882' title='28882'>'What now?' whispered Holmes. </span>
<span sid='28883' title='28883'>'Is he giving us the slip?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28884' title='28884'>'Impossible,' answered Pycroft.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28885' title='28885'>'Why so?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28886' title='28886'>'That door leads into an inner room.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28887' title='28887'>'There is no exit?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28888' title='28888'>'None.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28889' title='28889'>'Is it furnished?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28890' title='28890'>'It was empty yesterday.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28891' title='28891'>'Then what on earth can he be doing? </span>
<span sid='28892' title='28892'>There is something which I don't understand in this matter. </span>
<span sid='28893' title='28893'>If ever a man was three parts mad with terror, that man's name is <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pinner&t=h'>Pinner</a>. </span>
<span sid='28894' title='28894'>What can have put the shivers on him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28895' title='28895'>'He suspects that we are detectives,' I suggested.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28896' title='28896'>'That's it,' said Pycroft.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28897' title='28897'>Holmes shook his head. </span>
<span sid='28898' title='28898'>'He did not turn pale. </span>
<span sid='28899' title='28899'>He was pale when we entered the room,' said he. </span>
<span sid='28900' title='28900'>'It is just possible that-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28901' title='28901'>His words were interrupted by a sharp rat-tat from the direction of the inner door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28902' title='28902'>'What the deuce is he knocking at his own door for?' cried the clerk.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28903' title='28903'>Again and much louder came the rat-tat-tat. </span>
<span sid='28904' title='28904'>We all gazed expectantly at the closed door. </span>
<span sid='28905' title='28905'>Glancing at Holmes I saw his face turn rigid, and he leaned forward in intense excitement. </span>
<span sid='28906' title='28906'>Then suddenly came a low gurgling, gargling sound and a brisk drumming upon woodwork. </span>
<span sid='28907' title='28907'>Holmes sprang frantically across the room and pushed at the door. </span>
<span sid='28908' title='28908'>It was fastened on the inner side. </span>
<span sid='28909' title='28909'>Following his example, we threw ourselves upon it with all our weight. </span>
<span sid='28910' title='28910'>One hinge snapped, then the other, and down came the door with a crash. </span>
<span sid='28911' title='28911'>Rushing over it we found ourselves in the inner room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28912' title='28912'>It was empty.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28913' title='28913'>But it was only for a moment that we were at fault. </span>
<span sid='28914' title='28914'>At one corner, the corner nearest the room which we had left, there was a second door. </span>
<span sid='28915' title='28915'>Holmes sprang to it and pulled it open. </span>
<span sid='28916' title='28916'>A coat and waistcoat were lying on the floor, and from a hook behind the door, with his own braces round his neck, was hanging the managing director of the Franco-Midland Hardware Company. </span>
<span sid='28917' title='28917'>His knees were drawn up, his head hung at a dreadful angle to his body, and the clatter of his heels against the door made the noise which had broken in upon our conversation. </span>
<span sid='28918' title='28918'>In an instant I had caught him round the waist and held him up, while Holmes and Pycroft untied the elastic bands which had disappeared between the livid creases of skin. </span>
<span sid='28919' title='28919'>Then we carried him into the other room, where he lay with a slate-coloured face, puffing his purple lips in and out with every breath - a dreadful wreck of all that he had been but five minutes before.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28920' title='28920'>'What do you think of him, Watson?' asked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28921' title='28921'>I stooped over him and examined him. </span>
<span sid='28922' title='28922'>His pulse was feeble and intermittent, but his breathing grew longer, and there was a little shivering of his eyelids which showed a thin white slit of ball beneath.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28923' title='28923'>'It has been touch and go with him,' said I, 'but he'll live now. </span>
<span sid='28924' title='28924'>Just open that window and hand me the water carafe.' </span>
<span sid='28925' title='28925'>I undid his collar, poured the cold water over his face, and raised and sank his arms until he drew a long natural breath.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28926' title='28926'>'It's only a question of time now,' said I, as I turned away from him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28927' title='28927'>Holmes stood by the table with his hands deep in his trousers pockets and his chin upon his breast.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28928' title='28928'>'I suppose we ought to call the police in now,' said he, 'and yet I confess that I like to give them a complete case when they come.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28929' title='28929'>'It's a blessed mystery to me,' cried Pycroft, scratching his head. </span>
<span sid='28930' title='28930'>'Whatever they wanted to bring me all the way up here for, and then-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28931' title='28931'>'Pooh! </span>
<span sid='28932' title='28932'>All that is clear enough,' said Holmes impatiently. </span>
<span sid='28933' title='28933'>'It is this last sudden move.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28934' title='28934'>'You understand the rest, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28935' title='28935'>'I think that is fairly obvious. </span>
<span sid='28936' title='28936'>What do you say, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28937' title='28937'>I shrugged my shoulders.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28938' title='28938'>'I must confess that I am out of my depths,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28939' title='28939'>'Oh, surely, if you consider the events at first they can only point to one conclusion.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28940' title='28940'>'What do you make of them?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28941' title='28941'>'Well, the whole thing hinges upon two points. </span>
<span sid='28942' title='28942'>The first is the making of Pycroft write a declaration by which he entered the service of this preposterous company. </span>
<span sid='28943' title='28943'>Do you not see how very suggestive that is?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28944' title='28944'>'I am afraid I miss the point.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28945' title='28945'>'Well, why did they want him to do it? </span>
<span sid='28946' title='28946'>Not as a business matter, for these arrangements are usually verbal, and there was no earthly business reason why this should be an exception. </span>
<span sid='28947' title='28947'>Don't you see, my young friend, that they were very anxious to obtain a specimen of your handwriting, and had no other way of doing it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28948' title='28948'>'And why?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28949' title='28949'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='28950' title='28950'>Why? </span>
<span sid='28951' title='28951'>When we answer that, we have made some progress with our little problem. </span>
<span sid='28952' title='28952'>Why? </span>
<span sid='28953' title='28953'>There can be only one adequate reason. </span>
<span sid='28954' title='28954'>Someone wanted to learn to imitate your writing, and had to procure a specimen of it first. </span>
<span sid='28955' title='28955'>And now if we pass on to the second point, we find that each throws light upon the other. </span>
<span sid='28956' title='28956'>That point is the request made by <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pinner&t=h'>Pinner</a> that you should not resign your place, but should leave the manager of this important business in the full expectation that a Mr Hall Pycroft, whom he had never seen, was about to enter the office upon the Monday morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28957' title='28957'>'My God!' cried our client, 'what a blind beetle I have been!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28958' title='28958'>'Now you see the point about the handwriting. </span>
<span sid='28959' title='28959'>Suppose that someone turned up in your place who wrote a completely different hand from that in which you had applied for the vacancy, of course the game would have been up. </span>
<span sid='28960' title='28960'>But in the interval the rogue learnt to imitate you, and his position was therefore secure, as I presume that nobody in the office had ever set eyes upon you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28961' title='28961'>'Not a soul,' groaned Hall Pycroft.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28962' title='28962'>'Very good. </span>
<span sid='28963' title='28963'>Of course, it was of the utmost importance to prevent you from thinking better of it, and also to keep you from coming into contact with anyone who might tell you that your double was at work in Mawson's office. </span>
<span sid='28964' title='28964'>Therefore, they gave you a handsome advance on your salary, and ran you off to the Midlands, where they gave you enough work to do to prevent your going to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, where you might have burst their little game up. </span>
<span sid='28965' title='28965'>That is all plain enough.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28966' title='28966'>'But why should this man pretend to be his own brother?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28967' title='28967'>'Well, that is pretty clear also. </span>
<span sid='28968' title='28968'>There are evidently only two of them in it. </span>
<span sid='28969' title='28969'>The other is personating you at the office. </span>
<span sid='28970' title='28970'>This one acted as your engager, and then found that he could not find you an employer without admitting a third person into his plot. </span>
<span sid='28971' title='28971'>That he was most unwilling to do. </span>
<span sid='28972' title='28972'>He changed his appearance as far as he could, and trusted that the likeness, which you could not fail to observe, would be put down to a family resemblance. </span>
<span sid='28973' title='28973'>But for the happy chance of the gold stuffing your suspicions would probably have never been aroused.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28974' title='28974'>Hall Pycroft shook his clenched hands in the air. </span>
<span sid='28975' title='28975'>'Good Lord!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='28976' title='28976'>'While I have been fooled in this way, what has this other Hall Pycroft been doing at Mawson's? </span>
<span sid='28977' title='28977'>What should we do, Mr Holmes? </span>
<span sid='28978' title='28978'>Tell me what to do!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28979' title='28979'>'We must wire to Mawson's.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28980' title='28980'>'They shut at twelve on Saturdays.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28981' title='28981'>'Never mind, there may be some door-keeper or attendant-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28982' title='28982'>'Ah, yes, they keep a permanent guard there on account of the value of the securities that they hold. </span>
<span sid='28983' title='28983'>I remember hearing it talked of in the City.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28984' title='28984'>'Very good, we shall wire to him, and see if all is well, and if a clerk of your name is working there. </span>
<span sid='28985' title='28985'>That is clear enough, but what is not so clear is why at sight of us one of the rogues should instantly walk out of the room and hang himself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='28986' title='28986'>'The paper!' croaked a voice behind us. </span>
<span sid='28987' title='28987'>The man was sitting up, blanched and ghastly, with returning reason in his eyes, and hands which rubbed nervously at the broad red band which still encircled his throat.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28988' title='28988'>'The paper! </span>
<span sid='28989' title='28989'>Of course!' yelled Holmes, in a paroxysm of excitement. </span>
<span sid='28990' title='28990'>'Idiot that I was! </span>
<span sid='28991' title='28991'>I thought so much of our visit that the paper never entered my head for an instant. </span>
<span sid='28992' title='28992'>To be sure, the secret must lie there.' </span>
<span sid='28993' title='28993'>He flattened it out on the table, and a cry of triumph burst from his lips.</span>
<p>
<span sid='28994' title='28994'>'Look at this, Watson!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='28995' title='28995'>'It is a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> paper, an early edition of the Evening Standard. </span>
<span sid='28996' title='28996'>Here is what we want. </span>
<span sid='28997' title='28997'>Look at the headlines - "Crime in the City. </span>
<span sid='28998' title='28998'>Murder at Mawson and Williams'. </span>
<span sid='28999' title='28999'>Gigantic Attempted Robbery, Capture of the Criminal." </span>
<span sid='29000' title='29000'>Here, Watson, we are all equally anxious to hear it, so kindly read it aloud to us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29001' title='29001'>It appeared from its position in the paper to have been the one event of importance in town, and the account of it ran in this way:</span>
<p>
<span sid='29002' title='29002'>'A desperate attempt at robbery, culminating in the death of one man and the capture of the criminal, occurred this afternoon in the City. </span>
<span sid='29003' title='29003'>For some time back Mawson and Williams, the famous financial house, have been the guardians of securities which amount in the aggregate to a sum of considerably over a million sterling. </span>
<span sid='29004' title='29004'>So conscious was the manager of the responsibility which devolved upon him in consequence of the great interests at stake, that safes of the very latest construction have been employed, and an armed watchman has been left day and night in the building. </span>
<span sid='29005' title='29005'>It appears that last week a new clerk, named Hall Pycroft, was engaged by the firm. </span>
<span sid='29006' title='29006'>This person appears to have been none other than Beddington, the famous forger and cracksman, who, with his brother, has only recently emerged from a five years' spell of penal servitude. </span>
<span sid='29007' title='29007'>By some means, which are not yet clear, he succeeded in winning, under a false name, this official position in the office, which he utilized in order to obtain mouldings of various locks, and a thorough knowledge of the position of the strong room and the safes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='29008' title='29008'>'It is customary at Mawson's for the clerks to leave at midday on Saturday. </span>
<span sid='29009' title='29009'>Sergeant Tuson, of the City Police, was somewhat surprised therefore to see a gentleman with a carpet bag come down the steps at twenty minutes past one. </span>
<span sid='29010' title='29010'>His suspicions being aroused, the sergeant followed the man, and with the aid of Constable Pollock succeeded, after a most desperate resistance, in arresting him. </span>
<span sid='29011' title='29011'>It was at once clear that a daring and gigantic robbery had been committed. </span>
<span sid='29012' title='29012'>Nearly a hundred thousand pounds' worth of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n railway bonds, with a large amount of scrip in other mines and companies, were discovered in the bag. </span>
<span sid='29013' title='29013'>On examining the premises the body of the unfortunate watchman was found doubled up and thrust into the largest of the safes, where it would not have been discovered until Monday morning had it not been for the prompt action of Sergeant Tuson. </span>
<span sid='29014' title='29014'>The man's skull had been shattered by a blow from a poker, delivered from behind. </span>
<span sid='29015' title='29015'>There could be no doubt that Beddington had obtained entrance by pretending that he had left something behind him, and having murdered the watchman, rapidly rifled the large safe, and then made off with his booty. </span>
<span sid='29016' title='29016'>His brother, who usually works with him, has not appeared in this job, so far as can at present be ascertained, although the police are making energetic inquiries as to his whereabouts.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='29017' title='29017'>'Well, we may save the police some little trouble in that direction,' said Holmes, glancing at the haggard figure huddled up by the window. </span>
<span sid='29018' title='29018'>'Human nature is a strange mixture, Watson. </span>
<span sid='29019' title='29019'>You see that even a villain and a murderer can inspire such affection that his brother turns to suicide when he learns that his neck is forfeited. </span>
<span sid='29020' title='29020'>However, we have no choice as to our action. </span>
<span sid='29021' title='29021'>The doctor and I will remain on guard, Mr Pycroft, if you will have the kindness to step out for the police.'</span>
