<h1><span sid='56259' title='56259'>The Adventure of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sussex&t=h'>Sussex</a> Vampire</span></h1>
<p class="subtitle">Arthur Conan Doyle<label for="sn-meta-suss" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-meta-suss" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><!--googleoff: all--><b>Story Number</b>: 52<br><b>Published in</b>: The Strand Magazine (UK)<br><b>Collected in</b>: The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes<!--googleon: all--></span></p>
<p>
<span sid='56260' title='56260'>Holmes had read carefully a note which the last post had brought him. </span>
<span sid='56261' title='56261'>Then, with the dry chuckle which was his nearest approach to a laugh, he tossed it over to me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56262' title='56262'>'For a mixture of the modern and the mediaeval, of the practical and of the wildly fanciful, I think this is surely the limit,' said he. </span>
<span sid='56263' title='56263'>'What do you make of it, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56264' title='56264'>I read as follows:</span>
<p>
<span sid='56265' title='56265'>46 OLD JEWRY</span>
<p>
<span sid='56266' title='56266'>Nov. 19th.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56267' title='56267'>Re Vampires</span>
<p>
<span sid='56268' title='56268'>Sir,</span>
<p>
<span sid='56269' title='56269'>Our client, Mr Robert Ferguson, of Ferguson & Muirhead, tea brokers, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Mincing Lane&t=h'>Mincing Lane</a>, has made some inquiry from us in a communication of even date concerning vampires. </span>
<span sid='56270' title='56270'>As our firm specializes entirely upon the assessment of machinery the matter hardly comes within our purview, and we have therefore recommended Mr Ferguson to call upon you and lay the matter before you. </span>
<span sid='56271' title='56271'>We have not forgotten your successful action in the case of Matilda Briggs.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56272' title='56272'>We are, Sir,</span>
<p>
<span sid='56273' title='56273'>Faithfully yours,</span>
<p>
<span sid='56274' title='56274'>MORRISON, MORRISON, AND DODD</span>
<p>
<span sid='56275' title='56275'>per E.J.C.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56276' title='56276'>'Matilda Briggs was not the name of a young woman, Watson,' said Holmes, in a reminiscent voice. </span>
<span sid='56277' title='56277'>'It was a ship which is associated with the giant rat of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sumatra&t=h'>Sumatra</a>, a story for which the world is not yet prepared. </span>
<span sid='56278' title='56278'>But what do we know about vampires? </span>
<span sid='56279' title='56279'>Does it come within our purview either? </span>
<span sid='56280' title='56280'>Anything is better than stagnation, but really we seem to have been switched on to a Grimm's fairy tale. </span>
<span sid='56281' title='56281'>Make a long arm, Watson, and see what V has to say.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56282' title='56282'>I leaned back and took down the great index volume to which he referred. </span>
<span sid='56283' title='56283'>Holmes balanced it on his knee and his eyes moved slowly and lovingly over the record of old cases, mixed with the accumulated information of a lifetime.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56284' title='56284'>'Voyage of the Gloria Scott,' he read. </span>
<span sid='56285' title='56285'>'That was a bad business. </span>
<span sid='56286' title='56286'>I have some recollection that you made a record of it, Watson, though I was unable to congratulate you upon the result. </span>
<span sid='56287' title='56287'>Victor Lynch, forger. </span>
<span sid='56288' title='56288'>Venomous lizard or gila. </span>
<span sid='56289' title='56289'>Remarkable case, that! </span>
<span sid='56290' title='56290'>Vittoria, the circus belle. </span>
<span sid='56291' title='56291'>Vanderbilt and the Yeggman. </span>
<span sid='56292' title='56292'>Vipers. </span>
<span sid='56293' title='56293'>Vigor, the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Hammersmith&t=h'>Hammersmith</a> wonder. </span>
<span sid='56294' title='56294'>Hullo! </span>
<span sid='56295' title='56295'>Hullo! </span>
<span sid='56296' title='56296'>Good old index. </span>
<span sid='56297' title='56297'>You can't beat it. </span>
<span sid='56298' title='56298'>Listen to this, Watson. </span>
<span sid='56299' title='56299'>Vampirism in Hungary. </span>
<span sid='56300' title='56300'>And again, Vampires in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Transylvania&t=h'>Transylvania</a>.' </span>
<span sid='56301' title='56301'>He turned over the pages with eagerness, but after a short intent perusal he threw down the great book with a snarl of disappointment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56302' title='56302'>'Rubbish, Watson, rubbish! </span>
<span sid='56303' title='56303'>What have we to do with walking corpses who can only be held in their grave by stakes driven through their hearts? </span>
<span sid='56304' title='56304'>It's pure lunacy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56305' title='56305'>'But surely,' said I, 'the vampire was not necessarily a dead man? </span>
<span sid='56306' title='56306'>A living person might have the habit. </span>
<span sid='56307' title='56307'>I have read for example, of the old sucking the blood of the young in order to retain their youth.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56308' title='56308'>'You are right, Watson. </span>
<span sid='56309' title='56309'>It mentions the legend in one of these references. </span>
<span sid='56310' title='56310'>But are we to give serious attention to such things? </span>
<span sid='56311' title='56311'>This agency stands flat-footed upon the ground, and there it must remain. </span>
<span sid='56312' title='56312'>The world is big enough for us. </span>
<span sid='56313' title='56313'>No ghosts need apply. </span>
<span sid='56314' title='56314'>I fear that we cannot take Mr Robert Ferguson very seriously. </span>
<span sid='56315' title='56315'>Possibly this note may be from him, and may throw some light upon what is worrying him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56316' title='56316'>He took up a second letter which had lain unnoticed upon the table whilst he had been absorbed with the first. </span>
<span sid='56317' title='56317'>This he began to read with a smile of amusement upon his face which gradually faded away into an expression of intense interest and concentration. </span>
<span sid='56318' title='56318'>When he had finished he sat for some little time lost in thought with the letter dangling from his fingers. </span>
<span sid='56319' title='56319'>Finally, with a start, he aroused himself from his reverie.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56320' title='56320'>'Cheeseman's, Lamberley. </span>
<span sid='56321' title='56321'>Where is Lamberley, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56322' title='56322'>'It is in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sussex&t=h'>Sussex</a>, south of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Horsham&t=h'>Horsham</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56323' title='56323'>'Not very far, eh? </span>
<span sid='56324' title='56324'>And Cheeseman's?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56325' title='56325'>'I know that country, Holmes. </span>
<span sid='56326' title='56326'>It is full of old houses which are named after the men who built them centuries ago. </span>
<span sid='56327' title='56327'>You get Odley's and Harvey's and Carriton's - the folk are forgotten but their names live in their houses.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56328' title='56328'>'Precisely,' said Holmes coldly. </span>
<span sid='56329' title='56329'>It was one of the peculiarities of his proud, self-contained nature that, though he docketed any fresh information very quickly and accurately in his brain, he seldom made any acknowledgement to the giver. </span>
<span sid='56330' title='56330'>'I rather fancy we shall know a good deal more about Cheeseman's, Lamberley, before we are through. </span>
<span sid='56331' title='56331'>The letter is, as I had hoped, from Robert Ferguson. </span>
<span sid='56332' title='56332'>By the way, he claims acquaintance with you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56333' title='56333'>'With me!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56334' title='56334'>'You had better read it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56335' title='56335'>He handed the letter across. </span>
<span sid='56336' title='56336'>It was headed with the address quoted.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56337' title='56337'>Dear Mr Holmes, [it said]</span>
<p>
<span sid='56338' title='56338'>I have been recommended to you by my lawyers, but indeed the matter is so extraordinarily delicate that it is most difficult to discuss. </span>
<span sid='56339' title='56339'>It concerns a friend for whom I am acting. </span>
<span sid='56340' title='56340'>This gentleman married some five years ago a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Peru&t=h'>Peru</a>vian lady, the daughter of a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Peru&t=h'>Peru</a>vian merchant, whom he had met in connection with the importation of nitrates. </span>
<span sid='56341' title='56341'>The lady was very beautiful, but the fact of her foreign birth and of her alien religion always caused a separation of interests and of feelings between husband and wife, so that after a time his love may have cooled towards her and he may have come to regard their union as a mistake. </span>
<span sid='56342' title='56342'>He felt there were sides of her character which he could never explore or understand. </span>
<span sid='56343' title='56343'>This was the more painful as she was as loving a wife as a man could have - to all appearance absolutely devoted.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56344' title='56344'>Now for the point which I will make more plain when we meet. </span>
<span sid='56345' title='56345'>Indeed, this note is merely to give you a general idea of the situation and to ascertain whether you would care to interest yourself in the matter. </span>
<span sid='56346' title='56346'>The lady began to show some curious traits, quite alien to her ordinarily sweet and gentle disposition. </span>
<span sid='56347' title='56347'>The gentleman had been married twice and he had one son by the first wife. </span>
<span sid='56348' title='56348'>This boy was now fifteen, a very charming and affectionate youth, though unhappily injured through an accident in childhood. </span>
<span sid='56349' title='56349'>Twice the wife was caught in the act of assaulting this poor lad in the most unprovoked way. </span>
<span sid='56350' title='56350'>Once she struck him with a stick and left a great weal on his arm.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56351' title='56351'>This was a small matter, however, compared with her conduct to her own child, a dear boy just under one year of age. </span>
<span sid='56352' title='56352'>On one occasion about a month ago this child had been left by its nurse for a few minutes. </span>
<span sid='56353' title='56353'>A loud cry from the baby, as of pain, called the nurse back. </span>
<span sid='56354' title='56354'>As she ran into the room she saw her employer, the lady, leaning over the baby and apparently biting his neck. </span>
<span sid='56355' title='56355'>There was a small wound in the neck, from which a stream of blood had escaped. </span>
<span sid='56356' title='56356'>The nurse was so horrified that she wished to call the husband, but the lady implored her not to do so, and actually gave her five pounds as a price for her silence. </span>
<span sid='56357' title='56357'>No explanation was ever given, and for the moment the matter was passed over.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56358' title='56358'>It left, however, a terrible impression upon the nurse's mind, and from that time she began to watch her mistress closely, and to keep a closer guard upon the baby, whom she tenderly loved. </span>
<span sid='56359' title='56359'>It seemed to her that even as she watched the mother, so the mother watched her, and that every time she was compelled to leave the baby alone the mother was waiting to get at it. </span>
<span sid='56360' title='56360'>Day and night the nurse covered the child, and day and night the silent, watchful mother seemed to be lying in wait as a wolf waits for a lamb. </span>
<span sid='56361' title='56361'>It must read most incredible to you, and yet I beg you to take it seriously, for a child's life and a man's sanity may depend upon it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56362' title='56362'>At last there came one dreadful day when the facts could no longer be concealed from the husband. </span>
<span sid='56363' title='56363'>The nurse's nerve had given way, she could stand the strain no longer, and she made a clean breast of it all to the man. </span>
<span sid='56364' title='56364'>To him it seemed as wild a tale as it may now seem to you. </span>
<span sid='56365' title='56365'>He knew his wife to be a loving wife, and, save for the assaults upon her stepson, a loving mother. </span>
<span sid='56366' title='56366'>Why, then, should she wound her own dear little baby? </span>
<span sid='56367' title='56367'>He told the nurse that she was dreaming, that her suspicions were those of a lunatic, and that such libels upon her mistress were not to be tolerated. </span>
<span sid='56368' title='56368'>Whilst they were talking, a sudden cry of pain was heard. </span>
<span sid='56369' title='56369'>Nurse and master rushed together to the nursery. </span>
<span sid='56370' title='56370'>Imagine his feelings, Mr Holmes, as he saw his wife rise from a kneeling position beside the cot, and saw blood upon the child's exposed neck and upon the sheet. </span>
<span sid='56371' title='56371'>With a cry of horror, he turned his wife's face to the light and saw blood all round her lips. </span>
<span sid='56372' title='56372'>It was she - she beyond all question - who had drunk the poor baby's blood.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56373' title='56373'>So the matter stands. </span>
<span sid='56374' title='56374'>She is now confined to her room. </span>
<span sid='56375' title='56375'>There has been no explanation. </span>
<span sid='56376' title='56376'>The husband is half demented. </span>
<span sid='56377' title='56377'>He knows, and I know, little of Vampirism beyond the name. </span>
<span sid='56378' title='56378'>We had thought it was some wild tale of foreign parts. </span>
<span sid='56379' title='56379'>And yet here in the very heart of the English <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sussex&t=h'>Sussex</a> - well, all this can be discussed with you in the morning. </span>
<span sid='56380' title='56380'>Will you see me? </span>
<span sid='56381' title='56381'>Will you use your great powers in aiding a distracted man? </span>
<span sid='56382' title='56382'>If so, kindly wire to Ferguson, Cheeseman's, Lamberley, and I will be at your rooms by ten o'clock.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56383' title='56383'>Yours faithfully,</span>
<p>
<span sid='56384' title='56384'>ROBERT FERGUSON</span>
<p>
<span sid='56385' title='56385'>PS. - I believe your friend Watson played Rugby for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Blackheath&t=h'>Blackheath</a> when I was three-quarter for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Richmond&t=h'>Richmond</a>. </span>
<span sid='56386' title='56386'>It is the only personal introduction which I can give.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56387' title='56387'>'Of course I remember him,' said I, as I laid down the letter. </span>
<span sid='56388' title='56388'>'Big Bob Ferguson, the finest three-quarter <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Richmond&t=h'>Richmond</a> ever had. </span>
<span sid='56389' title='56389'>He was always a good-natured chap. </span>
<span sid='56390' title='56390'>It's like him to be so concerned over a friend's case.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56391' title='56391'>Holmes looked at me thoughtfully and shook his head.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56392' title='56392'>'I never get your limits, Watson,' said he. </span>
<span sid='56393' title='56393'>'There are unexplored possibilities about you. </span>
<span sid='56394' title='56394'>Take a wire down, like a good fellow. </span>
<span sid='56395' title='56395'>"Will examine your case with pleasure."'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56396' title='56396'>'Your case!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56397' title='56397'>'We must not let him think that this agency is a home for the weak-minded. </span>
<span sid='56398' title='56398'>Of course it is his case. </span>
<span sid='56399' title='56399'>Send him that wire and let the matter rest till morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56400' title='56400'>Promptly at ten o'clock next morning Ferguson strode into our room. </span>
<span sid='56401' title='56401'>I had remembered him as a long, slab-sided man with loose limbs and a fine turn of speed, which had carried him round many an opposing back. </span>
<span sid='56402' title='56402'>There is surely nothing in life more painful than to meet the wreck of a fine athlete whom one has known in his prime. </span>
<span sid='56403' title='56403'>His great frame had fallen in, his flaxen hair was scanty, and his shoulders were bowed. </span>
<span sid='56404' title='56404'>I fear that I roused corresponding emotions in him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56405' title='56405'>'Hullo, Watson,' said he, and his voice was still deep and hearty. </span>
<span sid='56406' title='56406'>'You don't look quite the man you did when I threw you over the ropes into the crowd at the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Old Deer Park&t=h'>Old Deer Park</a>. </span>
<span sid='56407' title='56407'>I expect I have changed a bit also. </span>
<span sid='56408' title='56408'>But it's this last day or two that has aged me. </span>
<span sid='56409' title='56409'>I see by your telegram, Mr Holmes, that it is no use my pretending to be anyone's deputy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56410' title='56410'>'It is simpler to deal direct,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56411' title='56411'>'Of course it is. </span>
<span sid='56412' title='56412'>But you can imagine how difficult it is when you are speaking of the one woman you are bound to protect and help. </span>
<span sid='56413' title='56413'>What can I do? </span>
<span sid='56414' title='56414'>How am I to go to the police with such a story? </span>
<span sid='56415' title='56415'>And yet the kiddies have got to be protected. </span>
<span sid='56416' title='56416'>Is it madness, Mr Holmes? </span>
<span sid='56417' title='56417'>Is it something in the blood? </span>
<span sid='56418' title='56418'>Have you any similar case in your experience? </span>
<span sid='56419' title='56419'>For God's sake, give me some advice, for I am at my wits' end.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56420' title='56420'>'Very naturally, Mr Ferguson. </span>
<span sid='56421' title='56421'>Now sit here and pull yourself together and give me a few clear answers. </span>
<span sid='56422' title='56422'>I can assure you that I am very far from being at my wits' end, and that I am confident we shall find some solution. </span>
<span sid='56423' title='56423'>First of all, tell me what steps you have taken. </span>
<span sid='56424' title='56424'>Is your wife still near the children?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56425' title='56425'>'We had a dreadful scene. </span>
<span sid='56426' title='56426'>She is a most loving woman, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='56427' title='56427'>If ever a woman loved a man with all her heart and soul, she loves me. </span>
<span sid='56428' title='56428'>She was cut to the heart that I should have discovered this horrible, this incredible, secret. </span>
<span sid='56429' title='56429'>She would not even speak. </span>
<span sid='56430' title='56430'>She gave no answer to my reproaches, save to gaze at me with a sort of wild, despairing look in her eyes. </span>
<span sid='56431' title='56431'>Then she rushed to her room and locked herself in. </span>
<span sid='56432' title='56432'>Since then she has refused to see me. </span>
<span sid='56433' title='56433'>She has a maid who was with her before her marriage, Dolores by name - a friend rather than a servant. </span>
<span sid='56434' title='56434'>She takes her food to her.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56435' title='56435'>'Then the child is in no immediate danger?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56436' title='56436'>'Mrs Mason, the nurse, has sworn that she will not leave it night or day. </span>
<span sid='56437' title='56437'>I can absolutely trust her. </span>
<span sid='56438' title='56438'>I am more uneasy about poor little Jack, for, as I told you in my note, he has twice been assaulted by her.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56439' title='56439'>'But never wounded?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56440' title='56440'>'No, she struck him savagely. </span>
<span sid='56441' title='56441'>It is the more terrible as he is a poor little inoffensive cripple.' </span>
<span sid='56442' title='56442'>Ferguson's gaunt features softened as he spoke of his boy. </span>
<span sid='56443' title='56443'>'You would think that the dear lad's condition would soften anyone's heart. </span>
<span sid='56444' title='56444'>A fall in childhood and a twisted spine, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='56445' title='56445'>But the dearest, most loving heart within.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56446' title='56446'>Holmes had picked up the letter of yesterday and was reading it over. </span>
<span sid='56447' title='56447'>'What other inmates are there in your house, Mr Ferguson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56448' title='56448'>'Two servants who have not been long with us. </span>
<span sid='56449' title='56449'>One stablehand, Michael, who sleeps in the house. </span>
<span sid='56450' title='56450'>My wife, myself, my boy Jack, baby, Dolores, and Mrs Mason. </span>
<span sid='56451' title='56451'>That is all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56452' title='56452'>'I gather that you did not know your wife well at the time of your marriage?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56453' title='56453'>'I had only known her a few weeks.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56454' title='56454'>'How long had this maid Dolores been with her?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56455' title='56455'>'Some years.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56456' title='56456'>'Then your wife's character would really be better known by Dolores than by you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56457' title='56457'>'Yes, you may say so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56458' title='56458'>Holmes made a note.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56459' title='56459'>'I fancy', said he, 'that I may be of more use at Lamberley than here. </span>
<span sid='56460' title='56460'>It is eminently a case for personal investigation. </span>
<span sid='56461' title='56461'>If the lady remains in her room, our presence could not annoy or inconvenience her. </span>
<span sid='56462' title='56462'>Of course, we would stay at the inn.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56463' title='56463'>Ferguson gave a gesture of relief.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56464' title='56464'>'It is what I hoped, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='56465' title='56465'>There is an excellent train at two from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Victoria&t=h'>Victoria</a>, if you could come.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56466' title='56466'>'Of course we could come. </span>
<span sid='56467' title='56467'>There is a lull at present. </span>
<span sid='56468' title='56468'>I can give you my undivided energies. </span>
<span sid='56469' title='56469'>Watson, of course, comes with us. </span>
<span sid='56470' title='56470'>But there are one or two points upon which I wish to be very sure before I start. </span>
<span sid='56471' title='56471'>This unhappy lady as I understand it, has appeared to assault both the children, her own baby and your little son?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56472' title='56472'>'That is so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56473' title='56473'>'But the results take different forms, do they not? </span>
<span sid='56474' title='56474'>She has beaten your son.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56475' title='56475'>'Once with a stick and once very savagely with her hands.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56476' title='56476'>'Did she give no explanation why she struck him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56477' title='56477'>'None, save that she hated him. </span>
<span sid='56478' title='56478'>Again and again she said so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56479' title='56479'>'Well, that is not unknown among stepmothers. </span>
<span sid='56480' title='56480'>A posthumous jealousy, we will say. </span>
<span sid='56481' title='56481'>Is the lady jealous by nature?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56482' title='56482'>'Yes, she is very jealous - jealous with all the strength of her fiery tropical love.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56483' title='56483'>'But the boy - he is fifteen, I understand, and probably very developed in mind, since his body has been circumscribed in action. </span>
<span sid='56484' title='56484'>Did he give you no explanation of these assaults?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56485' title='56485'>'No, he declared there was no reason.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56486' title='56486'>'Were they good friends at other times?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56487' title='56487'>'No, there was never any love between them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56488' title='56488'>'Yet you say he is affectionate?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56489' title='56489'>'Never in the world could there be so devoted a son. </span>
<span sid='56490' title='56490'>My life is his life. </span>
<span sid='56491' title='56491'>He is absorbed in what I say or do.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56492' title='56492'>Once again Holmes made a note. </span>
<span sid='56493' title='56493'>For some time he sat lost in thought.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56494' title='56494'>'No doubt you and the boy were great comrades before this second marriage. </span>
<span sid='56495' title='56495'>You were thrown very close together, were you not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56496' title='56496'>'Very much so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56497' title='56497'>'And the boy, having so affectionate a nature, was devoted, no doubt, to the memory of his mother?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56498' title='56498'>'Most devoted.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56499' title='56499'>'He would certainly seem to be a most interesting lad. </span>
<span sid='56500' title='56500'>There is one other point about these assaults. </span>
<span sid='56501' title='56501'>Were the strange attacks upon the baby and the assaults upon your son at the same period?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56502' title='56502'>'In the first case it was so. </span>
<span sid='56503' title='56503'>It was as if some frenzy had seized her, and she had vented her rage upon both. </span>
<span sid='56504' title='56504'>In the second case it was only Jack who suffered. </span>
<span sid='56505' title='56505'>Mrs Mason had no complaint to make about the baby.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56506' title='56506'>'That certainly complicates matters.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56507' title='56507'>'I don't quite follow you, Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56508' title='56508'>'Possibly not. </span>
<span sid='56509' title='56509'>One forms provisional theories and waits for time or fuller knowledge to explode them. </span>
<span sid='56510' title='56510'>A bad habit, Mr Ferguson, but human nature is weak. </span>
<span sid='56511' title='56511'>I fear that your old friend here has given an exaggerated view of my scientific methods. </span>
<span sid='56512' title='56512'>However, I will only say at the present stage that your problem does not appear to me to be insoluble, and that you may expect to find us at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Victoria&t=h'>Victoria</a> at two o'clock.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56513' title='56513'>It was evening of a dull, foggy November day when, having left our bags at the 'Chequers', Lamberley, we drove through the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sussex&t=h'>Sussex</a> clay of a long winding lane, and finally reached the isolated and ancient farmhouse in which Ferguson dwelt. </span>
<span sid='56514' title='56514'>It was a large, straggling building, very old in the centre, very new at the wings, with towering Tudor chimneys and a lichen-spotted, high-pitched roof of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Horsham&t=h'>Horsham</a> slabs. </span>
<span sid='56515' title='56515'>The doorsteps were worn into curves, and the ancient tiles which lined the porch were marked with the rebus of a cheese and a man, after the original builder. </span>
<span sid='56516' title='56516'>Within, the ceilings were corrugated with heavy oaken beams, and the uneven floors sagged into sharp curves. </span>
<span sid='56517' title='56517'>An odour of age and decay pervaded the whole crumbling building.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56518' title='56518'>There was one very large central room, into which Ferguson led us. </span>
<span sid='56519' title='56519'>Here, in a huge old-fashioned fireplace with an iron screen behind it dated 1670, there blazed and spluttered a splendid log fire.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56520' title='56520'>The room, as I gazed round, was a most singular mixture of dates and of places. </span>
<span sid='56521' title='56521'>The half-panelled walls may well have belonged to the original yeoman farmer of the seventeenth century. </span>
<span sid='56522' title='56522'>They were ornamented, however, on the lower part by a line of well-chosen modern water-colours, while above, where yellow plaster took the place of oak, there was hung a fine collection of South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n utensils and weapons, which had been brought, no doubt, by the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Peru&t=h'>Peru</a>vian lady upstairs. </span>
<span sid='56523' title='56523'>Holmes rose, with that quick curiosity which sprang from his eager mind, and examined them with some care. </span>
<span sid='56524' title='56524'>He returned with his eyes full of thought.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56525' title='56525'>'Hullo!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='56526' title='56526'>'Hullo!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56527' title='56527'>A spaniel had lain in a basket in the corner. </span>
<span sid='56528' title='56528'>It came slowly forward towards its master, walking with difficulty. </span>
<span sid='56529' title='56529'>Its hind legs moved irregularly and its tail was on the ground. </span>
<span sid='56530' title='56530'>It licked Ferguson's hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56531' title='56531'>'What is it, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56532' title='56532'>'The dog. </span>
<span sid='56533' title='56533'>What's the matter with it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56534' title='56534'>'That's what puzzled the vet. </span>
<span sid='56535' title='56535'>A sort of paralysis. </span>
<span sid='56536' title='56536'>Spinal meningitis, he thought. </span>
<span sid='56537' title='56537'>But it is passing. </span>
<span sid='56538' title='56538'>He'll be all right soon - won't you, Carlo?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56539' title='56539'>A shiver of assent passed through the drooping tail. </span>
<span sid='56540' title='56540'>The dog's mournful eyes passed from one of us to the other. </span>
<span sid='56541' title='56541'>He knew that we were discussing his case.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56542' title='56542'>'Did it come on suddenly?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56543' title='56543'>'In a single night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56544' title='56544'>'How long ago?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56545' title='56545'>'It may have been four months ago.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56546' title='56546'>'Very remarkable. </span>
<span sid='56547' title='56547'>Very suggestive.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56548' title='56548'>'What do you see in it, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56549' title='56549'>'A confirmation of what I had already thought.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56550' title='56550'>'For God's sake, what do you think, Mr Holmes? </span>
<span sid='56551' title='56551'>It may be a mere intellectual puzzle to you, but it is life and death to me! </span>
<span sid='56552' title='56552'>My wife a would-be murderer - my child in constant danger! </span>
<span sid='56553' title='56553'>Don't play with me, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='56554' title='56554'>It is too terribly serious.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56555' title='56555'>The big Rugby three-quarter was trembling all over. </span>
<span sid='56556' title='56556'>Holmes put his hand soothingly upon his arm.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56557' title='56557'>'I fear that there is pain for you, Mr Ferguson, whatever the solution may be,' said he. </span>
<span sid='56558' title='56558'>'I would spare you all I can. </span>
<span sid='56559' title='56559'>I cannot say more for the instant, but before I leave this house I hope I may have something definite.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56560' title='56560'>'Please God you may! </span>
<span sid='56561' title='56561'>If you will excuse me, gentlemen, I will go up to my wife's room and see if there has been any change.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56562' title='56562'>He was away some minutes, during which Holmes resumed his examination of the curiosities upon the wall. </span>
<span sid='56563' title='56563'>When our host returned it was clear from his downcast face that he had made no progress. </span>
<span sid='56564' title='56564'>He brought with him, a tall, slim, brown-faced girl.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56565' title='56565'>'The tea is ready, Dolores,' said Ferguson. </span>
<span sid='56566' title='56566'>'See that your mistress has everything she can wish.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56567' title='56567'>'She verra ill,' cried the girl, looking with indignant eyes at her master. </span>
<span sid='56568' title='56568'>'She no ask for food. </span>
<span sid='56569' title='56569'>She verra ill. </span>
<span sid='56570' title='56570'>She need doctor. </span>
<span sid='56571' title='56571'>I frightened stay alone with her without doctor.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56572' title='56572'>Ferguson looked at me with a question in his eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56573' title='56573'>'I should be so glad if I could be of use.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56574' title='56574'>'Would your mistress see Dr Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56575' title='56575'>'I take him. </span>
<span sid='56576' title='56576'>I no ask leave. </span>
<span sid='56577' title='56577'>She needs doctor.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56578' title='56578'>'Then I'll come with you at once.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56579' title='56579'>I followed the girl, who was quivering with strong emotion, up the staircase and down an ancient corridor. </span>
<span sid='56580' title='56580'>At the end was an iron-clamped and massive door. </span>
<span sid='56581' title='56581'>It struck me as I looked at it that if Ferguson tried to force his way to his wife he would find it no easy matter. </span>
<span sid='56582' title='56582'>The girl drew a key from her pocket, and the heavy oaken planks creaked upon their old hinges. </span>
<span sid='56583' title='56583'>I passed in and she swiftly followed, fastening the door behind her.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56584' title='56584'>On the bed a woman was lying who was clearly in a high fever. </span>
<span sid='56585' title='56585'>She was only half conscious, but as I entered she raised a pair of frightened but beautiful eyes and glared at me in apprehension. </span>
<span sid='56586' title='56586'>Seeing a stranger, she appeared to be relieved, and sank back with a sigh upon the pillow. </span>
<span sid='56587' title='56587'>I stepped up to her with a few reassuring words, and she lay still while I took her pulse and temperature. </span>
<span sid='56588' title='56588'>Both were high, and yet my impression was that the condition was rather that of mental and nervous excitement than of any actual seizure.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56589' title='56589'>'She lie like that one day, two day. </span>
<span sid='56590' title='56590'>I 'fraid she die,' said the girl.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56591' title='56591'>The woman turned her flushed and handsome face towards me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56592' title='56592'>'Where is my husband?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56593' title='56593'>'He is below, and would wish to see you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56594' title='56594'>'I will not see him. </span>
<span sid='56595' title='56595'>I will not see him.' </span>
<span sid='56596' title='56596'>Then she seemed to wander off into delirium. </span>
<span sid='56597' title='56597'>'A fiend! </span>
<span sid='56598' title='56598'>A fiend! </span>
<span sid='56599' title='56599'>Oh, what shall I do with this devil?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56600' title='56600'>'Can I help you in any way?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56601' title='56601'>'No. </span>
<span sid='56602' title='56602'>No one can help. </span>
<span sid='56603' title='56603'>It is finished. </span>
<span sid='56604' title='56604'>All is destroyed. </span>
<span sid='56605' title='56605'>Do what I will, all is destroyed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56606' title='56606'>The woman must have some strange delusion. </span>
<span sid='56607' title='56607'>I could not see honest Bob Ferguson in the character of fiend or devil.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56608' title='56608'>'Madame,' I said, 'your husband loves you dearly. </span>
<span sid='56609' title='56609'>He is deeply grieved at this happening.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56610' title='56610'>Again she turned on me those glorious eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56611' title='56611'>'He loves me. </span>
<span sid='56612' title='56612'>Yes. </span>
<span sid='56613' title='56613'>But do I not love him? </span>
<span sid='56614' title='56614'>Do I not love him even to sacrifice myself rather than break his dear heart. </span>
<span sid='56615' title='56615'>That is how I love him. </span>
<span sid='56616' title='56616'>And yet he could think of me - he could speak to me so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56617' title='56617'>'He is full of grief, but he cannot understand.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56618' title='56618'>'No, he cannot understand. </span>
<span sid='56619' title='56619'>But he should trust.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56620' title='56620'>'Will you not see him?' </span>
<span sid='56621' title='56621'>I suggested.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56622' title='56622'>'No, no, I cannot forget those terrible words nor the look upon his face. </span>
<span sid='56623' title='56623'>I will not see him. </span>
<span sid='56624' title='56624'>Go now. </span>
<span sid='56625' title='56625'>You can do nothing for me. </span>
<span sid='56626' title='56626'>Tell him only one thing. </span>
<span sid='56627' title='56627'>I want my child. </span>
<span sid='56628' title='56628'>I have a right to my child. </span>
<span sid='56629' title='56629'>That is the only message I can send him.' </span>
<span sid='56630' title='56630'>She turned her face to the wall and would say no more.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56631' title='56631'>I returned to the room downstairs, where Ferguson and Holmes still sat by the fire. </span>
<span sid='56632' title='56632'>Ferguson listened moodily to my account of the interview.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56633' title='56633'>'How can I send her the child?' he said. </span>
<span sid='56634' title='56634'>'How do I know what strange impulse might come upon her? </span>
<span sid='56635' title='56635'>How can I ever forget how she rose from beside it with its blood on her lips?' </span>
<span sid='56636' title='56636'>He shuddered at the recollection. </span>
<span sid='56637' title='56637'>'The child is safe with Mrs Mason, and there he must remain.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56638' title='56638'>A smart maid, the only modern thing which we had seen in the house, had brought in some tea. </span>
<span sid='56639' title='56639'>As she was serving it the door opened and a youth entered the room. </span>
<span sid='56640' title='56640'>He was a remarkable lad, pale-faced and fair-haired, with excitable light blue eyes which blazed into a sudden flame of emotion and joy as they rested upon his father. </span>
<span sid='56641' title='56641'>He rushed forward and threw his arms round his neck with the abandon of a loving girl.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56642' title='56642'>'Oh, daddy,' he cried, 'I did not know that you were due yet. </span>
<span sid='56643' title='56643'>I should have been here to meet you. </span>
<span sid='56644' title='56644'>Oh, I am so glad to see you!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56645' title='56645'>Ferguson gently disengaged himself from the embrace with some little show of embarrassment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56646' title='56646'>'Dear old chap,' said he, patting the flaxen head with a very tender hand. </span>
<span sid='56647' title='56647'>'I came early because my friends, Mr Holmes and Dr Watson, have been persuaded to come down and spend an evening with us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56648' title='56648'>'Is that Mr Holmes, the detective?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56649' title='56649'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56650' title='56650'>The youth looked at us with a very penetrating and, as it seemed to me, unfriendly gaze.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56651' title='56651'>'What about your other child, Mr Ferguson?' asked Holmes. </span>
<span sid='56652' title='56652'>'Might we make the acquaintance of the baby?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56653' title='56653'>'Ask Mrs Mason to bring baby down,' said Ferguson. </span>
<span sid='56654' title='56654'>The boy went off with a curious, shambling gait which told my surgical eyes that he was suffering from a weak spine. </span>
<span sid='56655' title='56655'>Presently he returned, and behind him came a tall, gaunt woman bearing in her arms a very beautiful child, darkeyed, golden-haired, a wonderful mixture of the Saxon and the Latin. </span>
<span sid='56656' title='56656'>Ferguson was evidently devoted to it, for he took it into his arms and fondled it most tenderly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56657' title='56657'>'Fancy anyone having the heart to hurt him,' he muttered, as he glanced down at the small, angry red pucker upon the cherub throat.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56658' title='56658'>It was at this moment that I chanced to glance at Holmes, and saw a most singular intentness in his expression. </span>
<span sid='56659' title='56659'>His face was as set as if it had been carved out of old ivory, and his eyes, which had glanced for a moment at father and child, were now fixed with eager curiosity upon something at the other side of the room. </span>
<span sid='56660' title='56660'>Following his gaze I could only guess that he was looking out through the window at the melancholy, dripping garden. </span>
<span sid='56661' title='56661'>It is true that a shutter had half closed outside and obstructed the view, but none the less it was certainly at the window that Holmes was fixing his concentrated attention. </span>
<span sid='56662' title='56662'>Then he smiled, and his eyes came back to the baby. </span>
<span sid='56663' title='56663'>On its chubby neck there was this small puckered mark. </span>
<span sid='56664' title='56664'>Without speaking, Holmes examined it with care. </span>
<span sid='56665' title='56665'>Finally he shook one of the dimpled fists which waved in front of him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56666' title='56666'>'Good-bye, little man. </span>
<span sid='56667' title='56667'>You have made a strange start in life. </span>
<span sid='56668' title='56668'>Nurse, I should wish to have a word with you in private.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56669' title='56669'>He took her aside and spoke earnestly for a few minutes. </span>
<span sid='56670' title='56670'>I only heard the last words, which were: </span>
<span sid='56671' title='56671'>'Your anxiety will soon, I hope, be set at rest.' </span>
<span sid='56672' title='56672'>The woman, who seemed to be a sour, silent kind of creature, withdrew with the child.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56673' title='56673'>'What is Mrs Mason like?' asked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56674' title='56674'>'Not very prepossessing externally, as you can see, but a heart of gold, and devoted to the child.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56675' title='56675'>'Do you like her, Jack?' </span>
<span sid='56676' title='56676'>Holmes turned suddenly upon the boy. </span>
<span sid='56677' title='56677'>His expressive mobile face shadowed over, and he shook his head.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56678' title='56678'>'Jacky has very strong likes and dislikes,' said Ferguson, putting his arm round the boy. </span>
<span sid='56679' title='56679'>'Luckily I am one of his likes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56680' title='56680'>The boy cooed and nestled his head upon his father's breast. </span>
<span sid='56681' title='56681'>Ferguson gently disengaged him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56682' title='56682'>'Run away, little Jacky,' said he, and he watched his son with loving eyes until he disappeared. </span>
<span sid='56683' title='56683'>'Now, Mr Holmes,' he continued, when the boy was gone. </span>
<span sid='56684' title='56684'>'I really feel that I have brought you on a fool's errand, for what can you possibly do, save give your sympathy? </span>
<span sid='56685' title='56685'>It must be an exceedingly delicate and complex affair from your point of view.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56686' title='56686'>'It is certainly delicate,' said my friend, with an amused smile, 'but I have not been struck up to now with its complexity. </span>
<span sid='56687' title='56687'>It has been a case for intellectual deduction, but when this original intellectual deduction is confirmed point by point by quite a number of independent incidents, then the subjective becomes objective and we can say confidently that we have reached our goal. </span>
<span sid='56688' title='56688'>I had, in fact, reached it before we left <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>, and the rest has merely been observation and confirmation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56689' title='56689'>Ferguson put his big hand to his furrowed forehead.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56690' title='56690'>'For heaven's sake, Holmes,' he said hoarsely, 'if you can see the truth in this matter, do not keep me in suspense. </span>
<span sid='56691' title='56691'>How do I stand? </span>
<span sid='56692' title='56692'>What shall I do? </span>
<span sid='56693' title='56693'>I care nothing as to how you have found your facts so long as you have really got them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56694' title='56694'>'Certainly I owe you an explanation, and you shall have it. </span>
<span sid='56695' title='56695'>But you will permit me to handle the matter in my own way? </span>
<span sid='56696' title='56696'>Is the lady capable of seeing us, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56697' title='56697'>'She is ill, but she is quite rational.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56698' title='56698'>'Very good. </span>
<span sid='56699' title='56699'>It is only in her presence that we can clear the matter up. </span>
<span sid='56700' title='56700'>Let us go up to her.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56701' title='56701'>'She will not see me,' cried Ferguson.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56702' title='56702'>'Oh, yes, she will,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='56703' title='56703'>He scribbled a few lines upon a sheet of paper. </span>
<span sid='56704' title='56704'>'You at least have the entrÃ©e, Watson. </span>
<span sid='56705' title='56705'>Will you have the goodness to give the lady this note?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56706' title='56706'>I ascended again and handed the note to Dolores, who cautiously opened the door. </span>
<span sid='56707' title='56707'>A minute later I heard a cry from within, a cry in which joy and surprise seemed to be blended. </span>
<span sid='56708' title='56708'>Dolores looked out.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56709' title='56709'>'She will see them. </span>
<span sid='56710' title='56710'>She will leesten,' said she.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56711' title='56711'>At my summons Ferguson and Holmes came up. </span>
<span sid='56712' title='56712'>As we entered the room Ferguson took a step or two towards his wife, who had raised herself in the bed, but she held out her hand to repulse him. </span>
<span sid='56713' title='56713'>He sank into an arm-chair, while Holmes seated himself beside him, after bowing to the lady, who looked at him with wide-eyed amazement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56714' title='56714'>'I think we can dispense with Dolores,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='56715' title='56715'>'Oh, very well, madame, if you would rather she stayed I can see no objection. </span>
<span sid='56716' title='56716'>Now, Mr Ferguson, I am a busy man with many calls, and my methods have to be short and direct. </span>
<span sid='56717' title='56717'>The swiftest surgery is the least painful. </span>
<span sid='56718' title='56718'>Let me first say what will ease your mind. </span>
<span sid='56719' title='56719'>Your wife is a very good, a very loving, and a very ill-used woman.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56720' title='56720'>Ferguson sat up with a cry of joy.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56721' title='56721'>'Prove that, Mr Holmes, and I am your debtor for ever.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56722' title='56722'>'I will do so, but in doing so I must wound you deeply in another direction.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56723' title='56723'>'I care nothing so long as you clear my wife. </span>
<span sid='56724' title='56724'>Everything on earth is insignificant compared to that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56725' title='56725'>'Let me tell you, then, the train of reasoning which passed through my mind in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='56726' title='56726'>The idea of a vampire was to me absurd. </span>
<span sid='56727' title='56727'>Such things do not happen in criminal practice in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>. </span>
<span sid='56728' title='56728'>And yet your observation was precise. </span>
<span sid='56729' title='56729'>You had seen the lady rise from beside the child's cot with the blood upon her lips.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56730' title='56730'>'I did.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56731' title='56731'>'Did it not occur to you that a bleeding wound may be sucked for some other purpose than to draw the blood from it? </span>
<span sid='56732' title='56732'>Was there not a Queen in English history who sucked such a wound to draw poison from it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56733' title='56733'>'Poison!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56734' title='56734'>'A South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n household. </span>
<span sid='56735' title='56735'>My instinct felt the presence of those weapons upon the wall before my eyes ever saw them. </span>
<span sid='56736' title='56736'>It might have been other poison, but that was what occurred to me. </span>
<span sid='56737' title='56737'>When I saw that little empty quiver beside the small bird-bow, it was just what I expected to see. </span>
<span sid='56738' title='56738'>If the child were pricked with one of those arrows dipped in curare or some other devilish drug, it would mean death if the venom were not sucked out.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56739' title='56739'>'And the dog! </span>
<span sid='56740' title='56740'>If one were to use such a poison, would one not try it first in order to see that it had not lost its power? </span>
<span sid='56741' title='56741'>I did not foresee the dog, but at least I understood him and he fitted into my reconstruction.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56742' title='56742'>'Now do you understand? </span>
<span sid='56743' title='56743'>Your wife feared such an attack. </span>
<span sid='56744' title='56744'>She saw it made and saved the child's life, and yet she shrank from telling you all the truth, for she knew how you loved the boy and feared lest it break your heart.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56745' title='56745'>'Jacky!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56746' title='56746'>'I watched him as you fondled the child just now. </span>
<span sid='56747' title='56747'>His face was clearly reflected in the glass of the window where the shutter formed a background. </span>
<span sid='56748' title='56748'>I saw such jealousy, such cruel hatred, as I have seldom seen in a human face.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56749' title='56749'>'My Jacky!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56750' title='56750'>'You have to face it, Mr Ferguson. </span>
<span sid='56751' title='56751'>It is the more painful because it is a distorted love, a maniacal exaggerated love for you, and possibly for his dead mother, which has prompted his action. </span>
<span sid='56752' title='56752'>His very soul is consumed with hatred for this splendid child, whose health and beauty are a contrast to his own weakness.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56753' title='56753'>'Good God! </span>
<span sid='56754' title='56754'>It is incredible!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56755' title='56755'>'Have I spoken the truth, madame?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56756' title='56756'>The lady was sobbing, with her face buried in the pillows. </span>
<span sid='56757' title='56757'>Now she turned to her husband.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56758' title='56758'>'How could I tell you, Bob? </span>
<span sid='56759' title='56759'>I felt the blow it would be to you. </span>
<span sid='56760' title='56760'>It was better that I should wait and that it should come from some other lips than mine. </span>
<span sid='56761' title='56761'>When this gentleman, who seems to have powers of magic, wrote that he knew all, I was glad.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56762' title='56762'>'I think a year at sea would be my prescription for Master Jacky,' said Holmes, rising from his chair. </span>
<span sid='56763' title='56763'>'Only one thing is still clouded, madame. </span>
<span sid='56764' title='56764'>We can quite understand your attacks upon Master Jacky. </span>
<span sid='56765' title='56765'>There is a limit to a mother's patience. </span>
<span sid='56766' title='56766'>But how did you dare to leave the child these last two days?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56767' title='56767'>'I had told Mrs Mason. </span>
<span sid='56768' title='56768'>She knew.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56769' title='56769'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='56770' title='56770'>So I imagined.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56771' title='56771'>Ferguson was standing by the bed, choking, his hands outstretched and quivering.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56772' title='56772'>'This, I fancy, is the time for our exit, Watson,' said Holmes in a whisper. </span>
<span sid='56773' title='56773'>'If you will take one elbow of the too faithful Dolores, I will take the other. </span>
<span sid='56774' title='56774'>There, now,' he added, as he closed the door behind him, 'I think we may leave them to settle the rest among themselves.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56775' title='56775'>I have only one further note in this case. </span>
<span sid='56776' title='56776'>It is the letter which Holmes wrote in final answer to that with which the narrative begins. </span>
<span sid='56777' title='56777'>It ran thus:</span>
<p>
<span sid='56778' title='56778'>BAKER STREET,</span>
<p>
<span sid='56779' title='56779'>Nov. 21st.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56780' title='56780'>Re Vampires</span>
<p>
<span sid='56781' title='56781'>Sir,</span>
<p>
<span sid='56782' title='56782'>Referring to your letter of the 19th, I beg to state that I have looked into the inquiry of your client, Mr Robert Ferguson, of Ferguson and Muirhead, tea brokers, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Mincing Lane&t=h'>Mincing Lane</a>, and that the matter has been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. </span>
<span sid='56783' title='56783'>With thanks for your recommendation,</span>
<p>
<span sid='56784' title='56784'>I am, Sir,</span>
<p>
<span sid='56785' title='56785'>Faithfully yours,</span>
