<h1><span sid='12595' title='12595'>The Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist</span></h1>
<p class="subtitle">Arthur Conan Doyle<label for="sn-meta-soli" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-meta-soli" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><!--googleoff: all--><b>Story Number</b>: 31<br><b>Published in</b>: The Collier's magazine, 26 December 1903 (US)<br><b>Collected in</b>: The Return of Sherlock Holmes<!--googleon: all--></span></p>
<p>
<span sid='12596' title='12596'>From the years 1894 to 1901 inclusive, Mr Sherlock Holmes was a very busy man. </span>
<span sid='12597' title='12597'>It is safe to say that there was no public case of any difficulty in which he was not consulted during those eight years, and there were hundreds of private cases, some of them of the most intricate and extraordinary character, in which he played a prominent part. </span>
<span sid='12598' title='12598'>Many startling successes and a few unavoidable failures were the outcome of this long period of continuous work. </span>
<span sid='12599' title='12599'>As I have preserved very full notes of all these cases, and was myself personally engaged in many of them, it may be imagined that it is no easy task to know which I should select to lay before the public. </span>
<span sid='12600' title='12600'>I shall, however, preserve my former rule, and give the preference to those cases which derive their interest not so much from the brutality of the crime as from the ingenuity and dramatic quality of the solution. </span>
<span sid='12601' title='12601'>For this reason I will now lay before the reader the facts connected with Miss Violet Smith, the solitary cyclist of Charlington, and the curious sequel of our investigation, which culminated in unexpected tragedy. </span>
<span sid='12602' title='12602'>It is true that the circumstances did not permit of any striking illustration of those powers for which my friend was famous, but there were some points about the case which made it stand out in those long records of crime from which I gather the material for these little narratives.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12603' title='12603'>On referring to my note-book for the year 1895, I find that it was upon Saturday, April 23rd, that we first heard of Miss Violet Smith. </span>
<span sid='12604' title='12604'>Her visit was, I remember, extremely unwelcome to Holmes, for he was immersed at the moment in a very abstruse and complicated problem concerning the peculiar persecution to which John Vincent Harden the well-known tobacco millionaire, had been subjected. </span>
<span sid='12605' title='12605'>My friend, who loved above all things precision and concentration of thought, resented anything which distracted his attention from the matter in hand. </span>
<span sid='12606' title='12606'>And yet without a harshness which was foreign to his nature it was impossible to refuse to listen to the story of the young and beautiful woman, tall, graceful and queenly, who presented herself at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> late in the evening and implored his assistance and advice. </span>
<span sid='12607' title='12607'>It was vain to urge that his time was already fully occupied, for the young lady had come with the determination to tell her story, and it was evident that nothing short of force could get her out of the room until she had done so. </span>
<span sid='12608' title='12608'>With a resigned air and a somewhat weary smile, Holmes begged the beautiful intruder to take a seat and to inform us what it was that was troubling her.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12609' title='12609'>'At least it cannot be your health,' said he, as his keen eyes darted over her; 'so ardent a bicyclist must be full of energy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12610' title='12610'>She glanced down in surprise at her own feet, and I observed the slight roughening of the side of the sole caused by the friction of the edge of the pedal.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12611' title='12611'>'Yes, I bicycle a good deal, Mr Holmes, and that has something to do with my visit to you to-day.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12612' title='12612'>My friend took the lady's ungloved hand and examined it with as close an attention and as little sentiment as a scientist would show to a specimen.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12613' title='12613'>'You will excuse me, I am sure. </span>
<span sid='12614' title='12614'>It is my business,' said he, as he dropped it. </span>
<span sid='12615' title='12615'>'I nearly fell into the error of supposing that you were typewriting. </span>
<span sid='12616' title='12616'>Of course, it is obvious that it is music. </span>
<span sid='12617' title='12617'>You observe the spatulate finger end, Watson, which is common to both professions? </span>
<span sid='12618' title='12618'>There is a spirituality about the face, however' - he gently turned it towards the light - 'which the typewriter does not generate. </span>
<span sid='12619' title='12619'>This lady is a musician.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12620' title='12620'>'Yes, Mr Holmes, I teach music.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12621' title='12621'>'In the country, I presume, from your complexion.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12622' title='12622'>'Yes, sir; near <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Farnham&t=h'>Farnham</a>, on the borders of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Surrey&t=h'>Surrey</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12623' title='12623'>'A beautiful neighbourhood, and full of the most interesting associations. </span>
<span sid='12624' title='12624'>You remember, Watson, that it was near there that we took Archie Stamford, the forger. </span>
<span sid='12625' title='12625'>Now, Miss Violet, what has happened to you near <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Farnham&t=h'>Farnham</a>, on the borders of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Surrey&t=h'>Surrey</a>?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12626' title='12626'>The young lady, with great clearness and composure, made the following curious statement:</span>
<p>
<span sid='12627' title='12627'>'My father is dead, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='12628' title='12628'>He was James Smith, who conducted the orchestra at the old Imperial Theatre. </span>
<span sid='12629' title='12629'>My mother and I were left without a relation in the world except one uncle, Ralph Smith, who went to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a> twenty-five years ago, and we have never had a word from him since. </span>
<span sid='12630' title='12630'>When Father died we were left very poor, but one day we were told that there was an advertisement in The Times inquiring for our whereabouts. </span>
<span sid='12631' title='12631'>You can imagine how excited we were, for we thought that someone had left us a fortune. </span>
<span sid='12632' title='12632'>We went at once to the lawyer whose name was given in the paper. </span>
<span sid='12633' title='12633'>There we met two gentlemen, Mr Carruthers and Mr Woodley, who were home on a visit from South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>. </span>
<span sid='12634' title='12634'>They said that my uncle was a friend of theirs, that he died some months before in great poverty in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Johannesburg&t=h'>Johannesburg</a>, and that he had asked them with his last breath to hunt up his relations and see that they were in no want. </span>
<span sid='12635' title='12635'>It seemed strange to us that Uncle Ralph, who took no notice of us when he was alive, should be so careful to look after us when he was dead; but Mr Carruthers explained that the reason was that my uncle had just heard of the death of his brother, and so felt responsible for our fate.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12636' title='12636'>'Excuse me,' said Holmes; 'when was this interview?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12637' title='12637'>'Last December - four months ago.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12638' title='12638'>'Pray proceed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12639' title='12639'>'Mr Woodley seemed to me to be a most odious person. </span>
<span sid='12640' title='12640'>He was for ever making eyes at me - a coarse, puffy-faced, red-moustached young man, with his hair plastered down on each side of his forehead. </span>
<span sid='12641' title='12641'>I thought that he was perfectly hateful - and I was sure that Cyril would not wish me to know such a person.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12642' title='12642'>'Oh, Cyril is his name!' said Holmes, smiling.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12643' title='12643'>The young lady blushed and laughed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12644' title='12644'>'Yes, Mr Holmes; Cyril Morton, an electrical engineer, and we hope to be married at the end of the summer. </span>
<span sid='12645' title='12645'>Dear me, how did I get talking about him? </span>
<span sid='12646' title='12646'>What I wished to say was that Mr Woodley was perfectly odious, but that Mr Carruthers, who was a much older man, was more agreeable. </span>
<span sid='12647' title='12647'>He was a dark, sallow, clean-shaven, silent person; but he had polite manners and a pleasant smile. </span>
<span sid='12648' title='12648'>He inquired how we were left, and on finding that we were very poor he suggested that I should come and teach music to his only daughter, aged ten. </span>
<span sid='12649' title='12649'>I said that I did not like to leave my mother, on which he suggested that I should go home to her every week-end, and he offered me a hundred a year, which was certainly splendid pay. </span>
<span sid='12650' title='12650'>So it ended by my accepting, and I went down to Chiltern Grange, about six miles from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Farnham&t=h'>Farnham</a>. </span>
<span sid='12651' title='12651'>Mr Carruthers was a widower, but he had engaged a lady-housekeeper, a very respectable, elderly person, called Mrs Dixon, to look after his establishment. </span>
<span sid='12652' title='12652'>The child was a dear, and everything promised well. </span>
<span sid='12653' title='12653'>Mr Carruthers was very kind and very musical, and we had most pleasant evenings together. </span>
<span sid='12654' title='12654'>Every week-end I went home to my mother in town.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12655' title='12655'>'The first flaw in my happiness was the arrival of the red-moustached Mr Woodley. </span>
<span sid='12656' title='12656'>He came for a visit of a week, and oh, it seemed three months to me! </span>
<span sid='12657' title='12657'>He was a dreadful person, a bully to everyone else, but to me something infinitely worse. </span>
<span sid='12658' title='12658'>He made odious love to me, boasted of his wealth, said that if I married him I would have the finest diamonds in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, and finally, when I would have nothing to do with him, he seized me in his arms one day after dinner - he was hideously strong	and he swore that he would not let me go until I had kissed him. </span>
<span sid='12659' title='12659'>Mr Carruthers came in, and tore him off from me, on which he turned upon his own host, knocking him down and cutting his face open. </span>
<span sid='12660' title='12660'>That was the end of his visit, as you can imagine. </span>
<span sid='12661' title='12661'>Mr Carruthers apologized to me next day, and assured me that I should never be exposed to such an insult again. </span>
<span sid='12662' title='12662'>I have not seen Mr Woodley since.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12663' title='12663'>'And now, Mr Holmes, I come at last to the special thing which has caused me to ask your advice to-day. </span>
<span sid='12664' title='12664'>You must know that every Saturday forenoon I ride on my bicycle to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Farnham&t=h'>Farnham</a> Station in order to get the 12.22 to town. </span>
<span sid='12665' title='12665'>The road from Chiltern Grange is a lonely one, and at one spot it is particularly so, for it lies for over a mile between Charlington Heath upon one side and the woods which lie round Charlington Hall upon the other. </span>
<span sid='12666' title='12666'>You could not find a more lonely tract of road anywhere, and it is quite rare to meet so much as a cart, or a peasant, until you reach the high-road near Crooksbury Hill. </span>
<span sid='12667' title='12667'>Two weeks ago I was passing this place when I chanced to look back over my shoulder, and about two hundred yards behind me I saw a man, also on a bicycle. </span>
<span sid='12668' title='12668'>He seemed to be a middle-aged man, with a short, dark beard. </span>
<span sid='12669' title='12669'>I looked back before I reached <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Farnham&t=h'>Farnham</a>, but the man was gone, so I thought no more about it. </span>
<span sid='12670' title='12670'>But you can imagine how surprised I was, Mr Holmes, when on my return on the Monday I saw the same man on the same stretch of road. </span>
<span sid='12671' title='12671'>My astonishment was increased when the incident occurred again, exactly as before, on the following Saturday and Monday. </span>
<span sid='12672' title='12672'>He always kept his distance, and did not molest me in any way, but still it certainly was very odd. </span>
<span sid='12673' title='12673'>I mentioned it to Mr Carruthers, who seemed interested in what I said, and told me that he had ordered a horse and trap, so that in future I should not pass over these lonely roads without some companion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12674' title='12674'>The horse and trap were to have come this week, but for some reason they were not delivered, and again I had to cycle to the station. </span>
<span sid='12675' title='12675'>That was this morning. </span>
<span sid='12676' title='12676'>You can think that I looked out when I came to Charlington Heath, and there, sure enough, was the man, exactly as he had been the two weeks before. </span>
<span sid='12677' title='12677'>He always kept so far from me that I could not clearly see his face, but it was certainly someone whom I did not know. </span>
<span sid='12678' title='12678'>He was dressed in a dark suit with a cloth cap. </span>
<span sid='12679' title='12679'>The only thing about his face that I could clearly see was his dark beard. </span>
<span sid='12680' title='12680'>To-day I was not alarmed, but I was filled with curiosity, and I determined to find out who he was and what he wanted. </span>
<span sid='12681' title='12681'>I slowed down my machine, but he slowed down his. </span>
<span sid='12682' title='12682'>Then I stopped altogether, but he stopped also. </span>
<span sid='12683' title='12683'>Then I laid a trap for him. </span>
<span sid='12684' title='12684'>There is a sharp turning of the road, and I pedalled very quickly round this, and then I stopped and waited. </span>
<span sid='12685' title='12685'>I expected him to shoot round and pass me before he could stop. </span>
<span sid='12686' title='12686'>But he never appeared. </span>
<span sid='12687' title='12687'>Then I went back and looked round the corner. </span>
<span sid='12688' title='12688'>I could see a mile of road, but he was not on it. </span>
<span sid='12689' title='12689'>To make it the more extraordinary there was no side-road at this point down which he could have gone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12690' title='12690'>Holmes chuckled and rubbed his hands.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12691' title='12691'>'This case certainly presents some features of its own,' said he. </span>
<span sid='12692' title='12692'>'How much time elapsed between your turning the corner and your discovery that the road was clear?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12693' title='12693'>'Two or three minutes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12694' title='12694'>'Then he could not have retreated down the road, and you say that there are no side-roads?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12695' title='12695'>'None.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12696' title='12696'>'Then he certainly took a footpath on one side or the other.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12697' title='12697'>'It could not have been on the side of the heath or I should have seen him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12698' title='12698'>'So by the process of exclusion we arrive at the fact that he made his way towards Charlington Hall, which, as I understand, is situated in its own grounds on one side of the road. </span>
<span sid='12699' title='12699'>Anything else?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12700' title='12700'>'Nothing, Mr Holmes, save that I was so perplexed that I felt I should not be happy until I had seen you and had your advice.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12701' title='12701'>Holmes sat in silence for some little time.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12702' title='12702'>'Where is the gentleman to whom you are engaged?' he asked at last.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12703' title='12703'>'He is in the Midland Electric Company, at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Coventry&t=h'>Coventry</a>? </span>
<span sid='12704' title='12704'>'He would not pay you a surprise visit?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12705' title='12705'>'Oh, Mr Holmes! </span>
<span sid='12706' title='12706'>As if I should not know him!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12707' title='12707'>'Have you had any other admirers?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12708' title='12708'>'Several before I knew Cyril.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12709' title='12709'>'And since?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12710' title='12710'>'There was this dreadful man, Woodley, if you can call him an admirer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12711' title='12711'>'No one else?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12712' title='12712'>Our fair client seemed a little confused.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12713' title='12713'>'Who was he?' asked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12714' title='12714'>'Oh, it may be a mere fancy of mine; but it has seemed to me sometimes that my employer, Mr Carruthers, takes a great deal of interest in me. </span>
<span sid='12715' title='12715'>We are thrown rather together. </span>
<span sid='12716' title='12716'>I play his accompaniments in the evening. </span>
<span sid='12717' title='12717'>He has never said anything. </span>
<span sid='12718' title='12718'>He is a perfect gentleman. </span>
<span sid='12719' title='12719'>But a girl always knows.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12720' title='12720'>'Ha!' </span>
<span sid='12721' title='12721'>Holmes looked grave. </span>
<span sid='12722' title='12722'>'What does he do for a living?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12723' title='12723'>'He is a rich man.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12724' title='12724'>'No carriages or horses?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12725' title='12725'>'Well, at least he is fairly well-to-do. </span>
<span sid='12726' title='12726'>But he goes into the City two or three times a week. </span>
<span sid='12727' title='12727'>He is deeply interested in South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>n gold shares.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12728' title='12728'>'You will let me know any fresh development, Miss Smith. </span>
<span sid='12729' title='12729'>I am very busy just now, but I will find time to make some inquiries into your case. </span>
<span sid='12730' title='12730'>In the meantime, take no step without letting me know. </span>
<span sid='12731' title='12731'>Good-bye, and I trust that we shall have nothing but good news from you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12732' title='12732'>'It is part of the settled order of Nature that such a girl should have followers,' said Holmes, as he pulled at his meditative pipe, 'but for choice not on bicycles in lonely country roads. </span>
<span sid='12733' title='12733'>Some secretive lover, beyond all doubt. </span>
<span sid='12734' title='12734'>But there are curious and suggestive details about the case, Watson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12735' title='12735'>'That he should appear only at that point?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12736' title='12736'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='12737' title='12737'>Our first effort must be to find who are the tenants of Charlington Hall. </span>
<span sid='12738' title='12738'>Then, again, how about the connection between Carruthers and Woodley, since they appear to be men of such different types? </span>
<span sid='12739' title='12739'>How came they both to be so keen upon looking up Ralph Smith's relations? </span>
<span sid='12740' title='12740'>One more point. </span>
<span sid='12741' title='12741'>What sort of a ménage is it which pays double the market price for a governess, but does not keep a horse although six miles from the station? </span>
<span sid='12742' title='12742'>Odd, Watson - very odd.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12743' title='12743'>'You will go down?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12744' title='12744'>'No, my dear fellow, you will go down. </span>
<span sid='12745' title='12745'>This may be some trifling intrigue, and I cannot break my other important research for the sake of it. </span>
<span sid='12746' title='12746'>On Monday you will arrive early at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Farnham&t=h'>Farnham</a>; you will conceal yourself near Charlington Heath; you will observe these facts for yourself, and act as your own judgement advises. </span>
<span sid='12747' title='12747'>Then, having inquired as to the occupants of the Hall, you will come back to me and report. </span>
<span sid='12748' title='12748'>And now, Watson, not another word of the matter until we have a few solid stepping-stones on which we may hope to get across to our solution.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12749' title='12749'>We had ascertained from the lady that she went down upon the Monday by the train which leaves Waterloo at 9.50, so I started early and caught the 9.13. </span>
<span sid='12750' title='12750'>At <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Farnham&t=h'>Farnham</a> Station I had no difficulty in being directed to Charlington Heath. </span>
<span sid='12751' title='12751'>It was impossible to mistake the scene of the young lady's adventure, for the road runs between the open heath on one side, and an old yew hedge upon the other, surrounding a park which is studded with magnificent trees. </span>
<span sid='12752' title='12752'>There was a main gateway of lichen-studded stone, each side-pillar surmounted by mouldering heraldic emblems; but besides this central carriage-drive I observed several points where there were gaps in the hedge and paths leading through them. </span>
<span sid='12753' title='12753'>The house was invisible from the road, but the surroundings all spoke of gloom and decay.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12754' title='12754'>The heath was covered with golden patches of flowering gorse, gleaming magnificently in the light of the bright spring sunshine. </span>
<span sid='12755' title='12755'>Behind one of these clumps I took up my position, so as to command both the gateway of the Hall and a long stretch of the road upon either side. </span>
<span sid='12756' title='12756'>It had been deserted when I left it, but now I saw a cyclist riding down it from the opposite direction to that in which I had come. </span>
<span sid='12757' title='12757'>He was clad in a dark suit, and I saw that he had a black beard. </span>
<span sid='12758' title='12758'>On reaching the end of the Charlington grounds he sprang from his machine and led it through a gap in the hedge, disappearing from my view.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12759' title='12759'>A quarter of an hour passed and then a second cyclist appeared. </span>
<span sid='12760' title='12760'>This time it was the young lady coming from the station. </span>
<span sid='12761' title='12761'>I saw her look about her as she came to the Charlington hedge. </span>
<span sid='12762' title='12762'>An instant later the man emerged from his hiding place, sprang upon his bicycle, and followed her. </span>
<span sid='12763' title='12763'>In all the broad landscape those were the only moving figures, the graceful girl sitting very straight upon her machine and the man behind her bending low over his handle-bar, with a curiously furtive suggestion in every movement. </span>
<span sid='12764' title='12764'>She looked back at him and slowed her pace. </span>
<span sid='12765' title='12765'>He slowed also. </span>
<span sid='12766' title='12766'>She stopped. </span>
<span sid='12767' title='12767'>He at once stopped, too, keeping two hundred yards behind her. </span>
<span sid='12768' title='12768'>Her next movement was as unexpected as it was spirited. </span>
<span sid='12769' title='12769'>She suddenly whisked her wheels round and dashed straight at him! </span>
<span sid='12770' title='12770'>He was as quick as she, however, and darted off in desperate flight. </span>
<span sid='12771' title='12771'>Presently she came back up the road again, her head haughtily in the air, not deigning to take further notice of her silent attendant. </span>
<span sid='12772' title='12772'>He had turned also, and still kept his distance until the curve of the road hid them from my sight.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12773' title='12773'>I remained in my hiding-place, and it was well that I did so, for presently the man reappeared, cycling slowly back. </span>
<span sid='12774' title='12774'>He turned in at the Hall gates and dismounted from his machine. </span>
<span sid='12775' title='12775'>For some few minutes I could see him standing among the trees. </span>
<span sid='12776' title='12776'>His hands were raised, and he seemed to be settling his necktie. </span>
<span sid='12777' title='12777'>Then he mounted his bicycle and rode away from me down the drive towards the Hall. </span>
<span sid='12778' title='12778'>I ran across the heath and peered through the trees. </span>
<span sid='12779' title='12779'>Far away I could catch glimpses of the old grey building with its bristling Tudor chimneys, but the drive ran through a dense shrubbery, and I saw no more of my man.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12780' title='12780'>However, it seemed to me that I had done a fairly good morning's work, and I walked back in high spirits to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Farnham&t=h'>Farnham</a>. </span>
<span sid='12781' title='12781'>The local house agent could tell me nothing about Charlington Hall, and referred me to a well-known firm in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pall Mall&t=h'>Pall Mall</a>. </span>
<span sid='12782' title='12782'>There I halted on my way home, and met with courtesy from the representative. </span>
<span sid='12783' title='12783'>No, I could not have Charlington Hall for the summer. </span>
<span sid='12784' title='12784'>I was just too late. </span>
<span sid='12785' title='12785'>It had been let about a month ago. </span>
<span sid='12786' title='12786'>Mr Williamson was the name of the tenant. </span>
<span sid='12787' title='12787'>He was a respectable elderly gentleman. </span>
<span sid='12788' title='12788'>The polite agent was afraid he could say no more, as the affairs of his clients were not matters which he could discuss.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12789' title='12789'>Mr Sherlock Holmes listened with attention to the long report which I was able to present to him that evening, but it did not elicit that word of curt praise which I had hoped for and should have valued. </span>
<span sid='12790' title='12790'>On the contrary, his austere face was even more severe than usual as he commented upon the things that I had done and the things that I had not.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12791' title='12791'>'Your hiding-place, my dear Watson, was very faulty. </span>
<span sid='12792' title='12792'>You should have been behind the hedge; then you would have had a close view of this interesting person. </span>
<span sid='12793' title='12793'>As it is you were some hundreds of yards away, and can tell me even less than Miss Smith. </span>
<span sid='12794' title='12794'>She thinks she does not know the man; I am convinced she does. </span>
<span sid='12795' title='12795'>Why, otherwise, should he be so desperately anxious that she should not get so near him as to see his features? </span>
<span sid='12796' title='12796'>You describe him as bending over the handle-bar. </span>
<span sid='12797' title='12797'>Concealment again, you see. </span>
<span sid='12798' title='12798'>You really have done remarkably badly. </span>
<span sid='12799' title='12799'>He returns to the house, and you want to find out who he is. </span>
<span sid='12800' title='12800'>You come to a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> house-agent!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12801' title='12801'>'What should I have done?' I cried, with some heat.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12802' title='12802'>'Gone to the nearest public house. </span>
<span sid='12803' title='12803'>That is the centre of country gossip. </span>
<span sid='12804' title='12804'>They would have told you every name, from the master to the scullery-maid. </span>
<span sid='12805' title='12805'>Williamson! </span>
<span sid='12806' title='12806'>It conveys nothing to my mind. </span>
<span sid='12807' title='12807'>If he is an elderly man he is not this active cyclist who springs away from that athletic young lady's pursuit. </span>
<span sid='12808' title='12808'>What have we gained by your expedition? </span>
<span sid='12809' title='12809'>The knowledge that the girl's story is true. </span>
<span sid='12810' title='12810'>I never doubted it. </span>
<span sid='12811' title='12811'>That there is a connection between the cyclist and the Hall. </span>
<span sid='12812' title='12812'>I never doubted that either. </span>
<span sid='12813' title='12813'>That the Hall is tenanted by Williamson. </span>
<span sid='12814' title='12814'>Who's the better for that? </span>
<span sid='12815' title='12815'>Well, well, my dear sir, don't look so depressed. </span>
<span sid='12816' title='12816'>We can do little more until next Saturday, and in the meantime I may make one or two inquiries myself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12817' title='12817'>Next morning we had a note from Miss Smith, recounting shortly and accurately the very incidents which I had seen, but the pith of the letter lay in the postscript:</span>
<p>
<span sid='12818' title='12818'>I am sure that you will respect my confidence, Mr Holmes, when I tell you that my place here has become difficult owing to the fact that my employer has proposed marriage to me. </span>
<span sid='12819' title='12819'>I am convinced that his feelings are most deep and most honourable. </span>
<span sid='12820' title='12820'>At the same time my promise is, of course, given. </span>
<span sid='12821' title='12821'>He took my refusal very seriously, but also very gently. </span>
<span sid='12822' title='12822'>You can understand, however, that the situation is a little strained.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12823' title='12823'>'Our young friend seems to be getting into deep waters,' said Holmes thoughtfully, as he finished the letter. </span>
<span sid='12824' title='12824'>'The case certainly presents more features of interest and more possibility of development than I had originally thought. </span>
<span sid='12825' title='12825'>I should be none the worse for a quiet, peaceful day in the country, and I am inclined to run down this afternoon and test one or two theories which I have formed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12826' title='12826'>Holmes's quiet day in the country had a singular termination, for he arrived at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> late in the evening with a cut lip and a discoloured lump upon his forehead, besides a general air of dissipation which would have made his own person the fitting object of a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a> investigation. </span>
<span sid='12827' title='12827'>He was immensely tickled by his own adventures, and laughed heartily as he recounted them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12828' title='12828'>'I get so little active exercise that it is always a treat,' said he. </span>
<span sid='12829' title='12829'>'You are aware that I have some proficiency in the good old British sport of boxing. </span>
<span sid='12830' title='12830'>Occasionally it is of service. </span>
<span sid='12831' title='12831'>Today, for example, I should have come to very ignominious grief without it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12832' title='12832'>I begged him to tell me what had occurred.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12833' title='12833'>'I found that country pub which I had already recommended to your notice, and there I made my discreet inquiries. </span>
<span sid='12834' title='12834'>I was in the bar, and a garrulous landlord was giving me all that I wanted. </span>
<span sid='12835' title='12835'>Williamson is a white-bearded man, and he lives alone with a small staff of servants at the Hall There is some rumour that he is or has been a clergyman; but one or two incidents of his short residence at the Hall struck me as peculiarly unecclesiastical. </span>
<span sid='12836' title='12836'>I have already made some inquiries at a clerical agency, and they tell me that there was a man of that name in orders whose career has been a singularly dark one. </span>
<span sid='12837' title='12837'>The landlord further informed me that there are usually week-end visitors - "a warm lot, sir" - at the Hall, and especially one gentleman with a red moustache, Mr Woodley by name, who was always there. </span>
<span sid='12838' title='12838'>We had got as far as this when who should walk in but the gentleman himself, who had been drinking his beer in the tap-room, and had heard the whole conversation. </span>
<span sid='12839' title='12839'>Who was I? </span>
<span sid='12840' title='12840'>What did I want? </span>
<span sid='12841' title='12841'>What did I mean by asking questions? </span>
<span sid='12842' title='12842'>He had a fine flow of language, and his adjectives were very vigorous. </span>
<span sid='12843' title='12843'>He ended a string of abuse by a vicious back-hander, which I failed to entirely avoid. </span>
<span sid='12844' title='12844'>The next few minutes were delicious. </span>
<span sid='12845' title='12845'>It was a straight left against a slogging ruffian. </span>
<span sid='12846' title='12846'>I emerged as you see me. </span>
<span sid='12847' title='12847'>Mr Woodley went home in a cart. </span>
<span sid='12848' title='12848'>So ended my country trip, and it must be confessed that, however enjoyable, my day on the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Surrey&t=h'>Surrey</a> border has not been much more profitable than your own.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12849' title='12849'>The Thursday brought us another letter from our client:</span>
<p>
<span sid='12850' title='12850'>You will not be surprised, Mr Holmes [said she], to hear that I am leaving Mr Carruthers's employment. </span>
<span sid='12851' title='12851'>Even the high pay cannot reconcile me to the discomforts of my situation. </span>
<span sid='12852' title='12852'>On Saturday I come up to town, and I do not intend to return. </span>
<span sid='12853' title='12853'>Mr Carruthers has got a trap, and so the dangers of the lonely road, if there ever were any dangers, are now over.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12854' title='12854'>As to the special cause of my leaving, it is not merely the strained situation with Mr Carruthers, but it is the reappearance of that odious man, Mr Woodley. </span>
<span sid='12855' title='12855'>He was always hideous, but he looks more awful than ever now, for he appears to have had an accident and he is much disfigured. </span>
<span sid='12856' title='12856'>I saw him out of the window, but I am glad to say I did not meet him. </span>
<span sid='12857' title='12857'>He had a long talk with Mr Carruthers, who seemed much excited afterwards. </span>
<span sid='12858' title='12858'>Woodley must be staying in the neighbourhood, for he did not sleep here, and yet I caught a glimpse of him again this morning slinking about in the shrubbery. </span>
<span sid='12859' title='12859'>I would sooner have a savage wild animal loose about the place. </span>
<span sid='12860' title='12860'>I loathe and fear him more than I can say. </span>
<span sid='12861' title='12861'>How can Mr Carruthers endure such a creature for a moment? </span>
<span sid='12862' title='12862'>However, all my troubles will be over on Saturday.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12863' title='12863'>'So I trust, Watson, so I trust,' said Holmes gravely. </span>
<span sid='12864' title='12864'>'There is some deep intrigue going on round that little woman, and it is our duty to see that no one molests her upon that last journey. </span>
<span sid='12865' title='12865'>I think, Watson, that we must spare time to run down together on Saturday morning, and make sure that this curious and inconclusive investigation has no untoward ending.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12866' title='12866'>I confess that I had not up to now taken a very serious view of the case, which had seemed to me rather grotesque and bizarre than dangerous. </span>
<span sid='12867' title='12867'>That a man should lie in wait or and follow a very handsome woman is no unheard-of thing, and if he had so little audacity that he not only dared not address her, but even fled from her approach, he was not a very formidable assailant. </span>
<span sid='12868' title='12868'>The ruffian Woodley was a very different person, but, except on the one occasion, he had not molested our client, and now he visited the house of Carruthers without intruding upon her presence. </span>
<span sid='12869' title='12869'>The man on the bicycle was doubtless a member of those week-end parties at the Hall of which the publican had spoken; but who he was or what he wanted was as obscure as ever. </span>
<span sid='12870' title='12870'>It was the severity of Holmes's manner and the fact that he slipped a revolver into his pocket before leaving our rooms which impressed me with the feeling that tragedy might prove to lurk behind this curious train of events.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12871' title='12871'>A rainy night had been followed by a glorious morning, and the heath-covered countryside, with the glowing clumps of flowering gorse, seemed all the more beautiful to eyes which were weary of the duns and drabs and slate-greys of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='12872' title='12872'>Holmes and I walked along the broad, sandy road inhaling the fresh morning air, and rejoicing in the music of the birds and the fresh breath of the spring. </span>
<span sid='12873' title='12873'>From a rise of the road on the shoulder of Crooksbury Hill we could see the grim Hall bristling out from amidst the ancient oaks, which, old as they were, were still younger than the building which they surrounded. </span>
<span sid='12874' title='12874'>Holmes pointed down the long tract of road which wound, a reddish-yellow band, between the brown of the heath and the budding green of the woods. </span>
<span sid='12875' title='12875'>Far away, a black dot, we could see a vehicle moving in our direction. </span>
<span sid='12876' title='12876'>Holmes gave an exclamation of impatience.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12877' title='12877'>'I had given a margin of half an hour,' said he. </span>
<span sid='12878' title='12878'>'If that is her trap she must be making for the earlier train. </span>
<span sid='12879' title='12879'>I fear, Watson, that she will be past Charlington before we can possibly meet her.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12880' title='12880'>From the instant that we passed the rise we could no longer see the vehicle, but we hastened onwards at such a pace that my sedentary life began to tell upon me, and I was compelled to fall behind. </span>
<span sid='12881' title='12881'>Holmes, however, was always in training, for he had inexhaustible stores of nervous energy upon which to draw. </span>
<span sid='12882' title='12882'>His springy step never slowed, until suddenly, when he was a hundred yards in front of me, he halted, and I saw him throw up his hand with a gesture of grief and despair. </span>
<span sid='12883' title='12883'>At the same instant an empty dog-cart, the horse cantering, the reins trailing, appeared round the curve of the road and rattled swiftly towards us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12884' title='12884'>'Too late, Watson; too late!' cried Holmes, as I ran panting to his side. </span>
<span sid='12885' title='12885'>'Fool that I was not to allow for the earlier train! </span>
<span sid='12886' title='12886'>It's abduction, Watson - abduction! </span>
<span sid='12887' title='12887'>Murder! </span>
<span sid='12888' title='12888'>God knows what! </span>
<span sid='12889' title='12889'>Block the road! </span>
<span sid='12890' title='12890'>Stop the horse! </span>
<span sid='12891' title='12891'>That's right. </span>
<span sid='12892' title='12892'>Now jump in, and let us see if I can repair the consequences of my own blunder.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12893' title='12893'>We had sprung into the dog-cart, and Holmes, after turning the horse, gave it a sharp cut with a whip, and we flew back along the road. </span>
<span sid='12894' title='12894'>As we turned the curve the whole stretch of road between the Hall and the heath was opened up. </span>
<span sid='12895' title='12895'>I grasped Holmes's arm.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12896' title='12896'>'That's the man!' I gasped.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12897' title='12897'>A solitary cyclist was coming towards us. </span>
<span sid='12898' title='12898'>His head was down and his shoulders rounded as he put every ounce of energy that he possessed on to the pedals. </span>
<span sid='12899' title='12899'>He was flying like a racer. </span>
<span sid='12900' title='12900'>Suddenly he raised his bearded face, saw us close to him, and pulled up, springing from his machine. </span>
<span sid='12901' title='12901'>That coal-black beard was in singular contrast to the pallor of his face, and his eyes were as bright as if he had a fever. </span>
<span sid='12902' title='12902'>He stared at us and at the dog-cart. </span>
<span sid='12903' title='12903'>Then a look of amazement came over his face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12904' title='12904'>'Hullo! </span>
<span sid='12905' title='12905'>Stop there!' he shouted, holding his bicycle to block our road. </span>
<span sid='12906' title='12906'>'Where did you get that dog-cart? </span>
<span sid='12907' title='12907'>Pull up, man!' he yelled, drawing a pistol from his side-pocket. </span>
<span sid='12908' title='12908'>'Pull up, I say, or, by George, I'll put a bullet into your horse!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12909' title='12909'>Holmes threw the reins into my lap and sprang down from the cart.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12910' title='12910'>'You're the man we want to see. </span>
<span sid='12911' title='12911'>Where is Miss Violet Smith?' he said in his quick, clear way.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12912' title='12912'>'That's what I am asking you. </span>
<span sid='12913' title='12913'>You're in her dog-cart. </span>
<span sid='12914' title='12914'>You ought to know where she is.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12915' title='12915'>'We met the dog-cart on the road. </span>
<span sid='12916' title='12916'>There was no one in it. </span>
<span sid='12917' title='12917'>We drove back to help the young lady.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12918' title='12918'>'Good Lord! </span>
<span sid='12919' title='12919'>Good Lord! </span>
<span sid='12920' title='12920'>What shall I do?' cried the stranger, in an ecstasy of despair. </span>
<span sid='12921' title='12921'>'They've got her, that hell-hound Woodley and the blackguard parson. </span>
<span sid='12922' title='12922'>Come, man, come, if you really are her friend. </span>
<span sid='12923' title='12923'>Stand by me and we'll save her, if I have to leave my carcass in Charlington Wood.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12924' title='12924'>He ran distractedly, his pistol in his hand, towards a gap in the hedge. </span>
<span sid='12925' title='12925'>Holmes followed him, and I, leaving the horse grazing beside the road, followed Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12926' title='12926'>'This is where they came through,' said he, pointing to the marks of several feet upon the muddy path. </span>
<span sid='12927' title='12927'>'Hullo! </span>
<span sid='12928' title='12928'>Stop a minute! </span>
<span sid='12929' title='12929'>Who's this in the bush?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12930' title='12930'>It was a young fellow about seventeen, dressed like an ostler, with leather cords and gaiters. </span>
<span sid='12931' title='12931'>He lay upon his back, his knees drawn up, a terrible cut upon his head. </span>
<span sid='12932' title='12932'>He was insensible, but alive. </span>
<span sid='12933' title='12933'>A glance at his wound told me that it had not penetrated the bone.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12934' title='12934'>'That's Peter, the groom,' cried the stranger. </span>
<span sid='12935' title='12935'>'He drove her. </span>
<span sid='12936' title='12936'>The beasts have pulled him off and clubbed him. </span>
<span sid='12937' title='12937'>Let him lie; we can't do him any good, but we may save her from the worst fate that can befall a woman.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12938' title='12938'>We ran frantically down the path, which wound among the trees. </span>
<span sid='12939' title='12939'>We had reached the shrubbery which surrounded the house when Holmes pulled up.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12940' title='12940'>'They didn't go to the house. </span>
<span sid='12941' title='12941'>Here are their marks on the left - here, beside the laurel bushes! </span>
<span sid='12942' title='12942'>Ah, I said so!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12943' title='12943'>As he spoke a woman's shrill scream - a scream which vibrated with a frenzy of horror - burst from the thick green clump of bushes in front of us. </span>
<span sid='12944' title='12944'>It ended suddenly on its highest note with a choke and gurgle.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12945' title='12945'>'This way! </span>
<span sid='12946' title='12946'>This way! </span>
<span sid='12947' title='12947'>They are in the bowling alley,' cried the stranger, darting through the bushes. </span>
<span sid='12948' title='12948'>'Ah, the cowardly dogs! </span>
<span sid='12949' title='12949'>Follow me, gentlemen! </span>
<span sid='12950' title='12950'>Too late! too late! by the living Jingo!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12951' title='12951'>We had broken suddenly into a lovely glade of greensward surrounded by ancient trees. </span>
<span sid='12952' title='12952'>On the farther side of it, under the shadow of a mighty oak, there stood a singular group of three people. </span>
<span sid='12953' title='12953'>One was a woman, our client, drooping and faint, a handkerchief round her mouth. </span>
<span sid='12954' title='12954'>Opposite her stood a brutal, heavy-faced, red-moustached young man, his gaitered legs parted wide, one arm akimbo, the other waving a riding-crop, his whole attitude suggestive of a triumphant bravado. </span>
<span sid='12955' title='12955'>Between them an elderly, grey-bearded man, wearing a short surplice over a light tweed suit, had evidently just completed the wedding service, for he pocketed his Prayer-Book as we appeared, and slapped the sinister bridegroom upon the back in jovial congratulation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12956' title='12956'>'They're married!' I gasped.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12957' title='12957'>'Come, on!' cried our guide; 'come on!' </span>
<span sid='12958' title='12958'>He rushed across the glade, Holmes and I at his heels. </span>
<span sid='12959' title='12959'>As we approached, the lady staggered against the trunk of the tree for support. </span>
<span sid='12960' title='12960'>Williamson, the ex-clergyman, bowed to us with mock politeness, and the bully Woodley advanced with a shout of brutal and exultant laughter.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12961' title='12961'>'You can take your beard off, Bob,' said he. </span>
<span sid='12962' title='12962'>'I know you right enough. </span>
<span sid='12963' title='12963'>Well, you and your pals have just come in time for me to be able to introduce you to Mrs Woodley.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12964' title='12964'>Our guide's answer was a singular one. </span>
<span sid='12965' title='12965'>He snatched off the dark beard which had disguised him and threw it on the ground, disclosing a long, sallow, clean-shaven face below it. </span>
<span sid='12966' title='12966'>Then he raised his revolver and covered the young ruffian, who was advancing upon him with his dangerous riding-crop swinging in his hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12967' title='12967'>'Yes,' said our ally, 'I am Bob Carruthers, and I'll see this woman righted if I have to swing for it. </span>
<span sid='12968' title='12968'>I told you what I'd do if you molested her, and, by the Lord, I'll be as good as my word!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12969' title='12969'>'You're too late. </span>
<span sid='12970' title='12970'>She's my wife!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12971' title='12971'>'No, she's your widow.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12972' title='12972'>His revolver cracked, and I saw the blood spurt from the front of Woodley's waistcoat. </span>
<span sid='12973' title='12973'>He spun round with a scream and fell upon his back, his hideous red face turning suddenly to a dreadful mottled pallor. </span>
<span sid='12974' title='12974'>The old man, still clad in his supplice, burst into such a string of foul oaths as I have never heard, and pulled out a revolver of his own, but before he could raise it he was looking down the barrel of Holmes's weapon.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12975' title='12975'>'Enough of this,' said my friend coldly. </span>
<span sid='12976' title='12976'>'Drop that pistol! </span>
<span sid='12977' title='12977'>Watson, pick it up! </span>
<span sid='12978' title='12978'>Hold it to his head! </span>
<span sid='12979' title='12979'>Thank you. </span>
<span sid='12980' title='12980'>You, Carruthers, give me that revolver. </span>
<span sid='12981' title='12981'>We'll have no more violence. </span>
<span sid='12982' title='12982'>Come, hand it over!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12983' title='12983'>'Who are you, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12984' title='12984'>'My name is Sherlock Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12985' title='12985'>'Good Lord!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12986' title='12986'>'You have heard of me, I see. </span>
<span sid='12987' title='12987'>I will represent the official police until their arrival. </span>
<span sid='12988' title='12988'>Here, you!' he shouted to the frightened groom, who had appeared at the edge of the glade. </span>
<span sid='12989' title='12989'>'Come here. </span>
<span sid='12990' title='12990'>Take this note as hard as you can ride to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Farnham&t=h'>Farnham</a>.' </span>
<span sid='12991' title='12991'>He scribbled a few words upon a leaf from his notebook. </span>
<span sid='12992' title='12992'>'Give it to the superintendent at the police-station. </span>
<span sid='12993' title='12993'>Until he comes, I must detain you all under my personal custody.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12994' title='12994'>The strong, masterful personality of Holmes dominated the tragic scene, and all were equally puppets in his hands. </span>
<span sid='12995' title='12995'>Williamson and Carruthers found themselves carrying the wounded Woodley into the house, and I gave my arm to the frightened girl. </span>
<span sid='12996' title='12996'>The injured man was laid on his bed, and at Holmes's request I examined him. </span>
<span sid='12997' title='12997'>I carried my report to where he sat in the old tapestry-hung dining-room with his two prisoners before him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12998' title='12998'>'He will live,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12999' title='12999'>'What!' cried Carruthers, springing out of his chair. </span>
<span sid='13000' title='13000'>'I'll go upstairs and finish him first. </span>
<span sid='13001' title='13001'>Do you tell me that that girl, that angel, is to be tied to Roaring Jack Woodley for life?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13002' title='13002'>'You need not concern yourself about that,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='13003' title='13003'>'There are two very good reasons why she should under no circumstances be his wife. </span>
<span sid='13004' title='13004'>In the first place, we are very safe in questioning Mr Williamson's right to solemnize a marriage.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13005' title='13005'>'I have been ordained,' cried the old rascal.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13006' title='13006'>'And also unfrocked.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13007' title='13007'>'Once a clergyman, always a clergyman.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13008' title='13008'>'I think not. </span>
<span sid='13009' title='13009'>How about the licence?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13010' title='13010'>'We had a licence for the marriage. </span>
<span sid='13011' title='13011'>I have it here in my pocket.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13012' title='13012'>'Then you got it by a trick. </span>
<span sid='13013' title='13013'>But in any case a forced marriage is no marriage, but it is a very serious felony, as you will discover before you have finished. </span>
<span sid='13014' title='13014'>You'll have time to think the point out during the next ten years or so, unless I am mistaken. </span>
<span sid='13015' title='13015'>As to you, Carruthers, you would have done better to keep your pistol in your pocket.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13016' title='13016'>'I begin to think so, Mr Holmes; but when I thought of all the precaution I had taken to shield this girl - for I loved her, Mr Holmes, and it is the only time that ever I knew what love was - it fairly drove me mad to think that she was in the power of the greatest brute and bully in South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>, a man whose name is a holy terror from Kimberley to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Johannesburg&t=h'>Johannesburg</a>. </span>
<span sid='13017' title='13017'>Why, Mr Holmes, you'll hardly believe it, but ever since that girl has been in my employment I never once let her go past this house, where I knew these rascals were lurking, without following her on my bicycle just to see that she came to no harm. </span>
<span sid='13018' title='13018'>I kept my distance from her, and I wore a beard so that she should not recognize me, for she is a good and high-spirited girl, and she wouldn't have stayed in my employment long if she had thought that I was following her about the country roads.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13019' title='13019'>'Why didn't you tell her of her danger?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13020' title='13020'>'Because then, again, she would have left me, and I couldn't bear to face that. </span>
<span sid='13021' title='13021'>Even if she couldn't love me it was a great deal to me just to see her dainty form about the house, and to hear the sound of her voice.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13022' title='13022'>'Well,' said I, 'you call that love, Mr Carruthers, but I should call it selfishness.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13023' title='13023'>'Maybe the two things go together. </span>
<span sid='13024' title='13024'>Anyhow, I couldn't let her go. </span>
<span sid='13025' title='13025'>Besides, with this crowd about, it was well that she should have someone near to look after her. </span>
<span sid='13026' title='13026'>Then when the cable came I knew they were bound to make a move.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13027' title='13027'>'What cable?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13028' title='13028'>Carruthers took a telegram from his pocket.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13029' title='13029'>'That's it!' said he. </span>
<span sid='13030' title='13030'>It was short and concise: THE OLD MAN IS DEAD.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13031' title='13031'>'Hum!' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='13032' title='13032'>'I think I see how things worked, and I can understand how this message would, as you say, bring them to a head. </span>
<span sid='13033' title='13033'>But while we wait, you might tell me what you can.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13034' title='13034'>The old reprobate with the surplice burst into a volley of bad language.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13035' title='13035'>'By God,' said he, 'if you squeal on us, Bob Carruthers, I'll serve you as you served Jack Woodley! </span>
<span sid='13036' title='13036'>You can bleat about the girl to your heart's content, for that's your own affair, but if you round on your pals to this plain-clothes copper it will be the worst day's work that ever you did.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13037' title='13037'>'Your reverence need not be excited,' said Holmes, lighting a cigarette. </span>
<span sid='13038' title='13038'>'The case is clear enough against you, and all I ask is a few details for my private curiosity. </span>
<span sid='13039' title='13039'>However, if there's any difficulty in your telling me I'll do the talking, and then you will see how far you have a chance of holding back your secrets. </span>
<span sid='13040' title='13040'>In the first place, three of you came from South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a> on this game - you, Williamson, you, Carruthers, and Woodley.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13041' title='13041'>'Lie number one,' said the old man; 'I never saw either of them until two months ago, and I have never been in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a> in my life, so you can put that in your pipe and smoke it, Mr Busybody Holmes!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13042' title='13042'>'What he says is true,' said Carruthers.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13043' title='13043'>'Well, well, two of you came over. </span>
<span sid='13044' title='13044'>His reverence is our own home-made article. </span>
<span sid='13045' title='13045'>You had known Ralph Smith in South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>. </span>
<span sid='13046' title='13046'>You had reason to believe he would not live long. </span>
<span sid='13047' title='13047'>You found out that his niece would inherit his fortune. </span>
<span sid='13048' title='13048'>How's that - eh?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13049' title='13049'>Carruthers nodded, and Williamson swore.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13050' title='13050'>'She was next-of-kin, no doubt, and you were aware that the old fellow would make no will.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13051' title='13051'>'Couldn't read or write,' said Carruthers.</span>
<p>
<span sid='13052' title='13052'>'So you came over, the two of you, and hunted up the girl. </span>
<span sid='13053' title='13053'>The idea was that one of you was to marry her, and the other have a share of the plunder. </span>
<span sid='13054' title='13054'>For some reason Woodley was chosen as the husband. </span>
<span sid='13055' title='13055'>Why was that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13056' title='13056'>'We played cards for her on the voyage. </span>
<span sid='13057' title='13057'>He won.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13058' title='13058'>'I see. </span>
<span sid='13059' title='13059'>You got the young lady into your service, and there Woodley was to do the courting. </span>
<span sid='13060' title='13060'>She recognized the drunken brute that he was, and would have nothing to do with him. </span>
<span sid='13061' title='13061'>Meanwhile, your arrangement was rather upset by the fact that you had yourself fallen in love with the lady. </span>
<span sid='13062' title='13062'>You could no longer bear the idea of this ruffian owning her.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13063' title='13063'>'No, by George, I couldn't!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13064' title='13064'>'There was a quarrel between you. </span>
<span sid='13065' title='13065'>He left you in a rage, and began to make his own plans independently of you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13066' title='13066'>'It strikes me, Williamson, there isn't very much that we can tell this gentleman,' cried Carruthers, with a bitter laugh. </span>
<span sid='13067' title='13067'>Yes, we quarrelled, and he knocked me down. </span>
<span sid='13068' title='13068'>I am level with him on that, anyhow. </span>
<span sid='13069' title='13069'>Then I lost sight of him. </span>
<span sid='13070' title='13070'>That was when he picked up with this cast padre here. </span>
<span sid='13071' title='13071'>I found that they had set up housekeeping together at this place on the line that she had to pass for the station. </span>
<span sid='13072' title='13072'>I kept my eye on her after that, for I knew there was some devilry in the wind. </span>
<span sid='13073' title='13073'>I saw them from time to time, for I was anxious to know what they were after. </span>
<span sid='13074' title='13074'>Two days ago Woodley came up to my house with this cable, which showed that Ralph Smith was dead. </span>
<span sid='13075' title='13075'>He asked me if I would stand by the bargain. </span>
<span sid='13076' title='13076'>I said I would not. </span>
<span sid='13077' title='13077'>He asked me if I would marry the girl myself and give him a share I said I would willingly do so, but that she would not have me. </span>
<span sid='13078' title='13078'>He said, "Let us get her married first, and after a week or two she may see things a bit different." </span>
<span sid='13079' title='13079'>I said I would have nothing to do with violence. </span>
<span sid='13080' title='13080'>So he went off cursing, like the foul-mouthed blackguard that he was, and swearing that he would have her yet. </span>
<span sid='13081' title='13081'>She was leaving me this week-end, and I had got a trap to take her to the station, but I was so uneasy in my mind that I followed her on my bicycle. </span>
<span sid='13082' title='13082'>She had got a start, however, and before I could catch her the mischief was done. </span>
<span sid='13083' title='13083'>The first thing I knew about it was when I saw you two gentlemen driving back in her dog-cart.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13084' title='13084'>Holmes rose and tossed the end of his cigarette into the grate. </span>
<span sid='13085' title='13085'>'I have been very obtuse, Watson,' said he. </span>
<span sid='13086' title='13086'>'When in your report you said that you had seen the cyclist as you thought arrange his necktie in the shrubbery, that alone should have told me all. </span>
<span sid='13087' title='13087'>However, we may congratulate ourselves upon a curious and in some respects a unique case. </span>
<span sid='13088' title='13088'>I perceive three of the county constabulary in the drive, and I am glad to see that the little ostler is able to keep pace with them; so it is likely that neither he nor the interesting bridegroom will be permanently damaged by their morning's adventures. </span>
<span sid='13089' title='13089'>I think, Watson, that in your medical capacity you might wait upon Miss Smith and tell her that if she is sufficiently recovered we shall be happy to escort her to her mother's home. </span>
<span sid='13090' title='13090'>If she is not quite convalescent you will find that a hint that we were about to telegraph to a young electrician in the Midlands would probably complete the cure. </span>
<span sid='13091' title='13091'>As to you, Mr Carruthers, I think that you have done what you could to make amends for your share in an evil plot. </span>
<span sid='13092' title='13092'>There is my card, sir, and if my evidence can be of help to you in your trial it shall be at your disposal.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='13093' title='13093'>In the whirl of our incessant activity it has often been difficult for me, as the reader has probably observed, to round off my narratives, and to give those final details which the curious might expect. </span>
<span sid='13094' title='13094'>Each case has been the prelude to another, and the crisis once over, the actors have passed for ever out of our busy lives. </span>
<span sid='13095' title='13095'>I find, however, a short note at the end of my manuscripts dealing with this case, in which I have put it upon record that Miss Violet Smith did indeed inherit a large fortune, and that she is now the wife of Cyril Morton, the senior partner of Morton and Kennedy, the famous <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Westminster&t=h'>Westminster</a> electricians. </span>
<span sid='13096' title='13096'>Williamson and Woodley were both tried for abduction and assault, the former getting seven years and the latter ten. </span>
<span sid='13097' title='13097'>Of the fate of Carruthers I have no record, but I am sure that his assault was not viewed very gravely by the Court, since Woodley had the reputation of being a most dangerous ruffian, and I think that a few months were sufficient to satisfy the demands of justice.</span>
