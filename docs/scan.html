<p class="subtitle">Arthur Conan Doyle<label for="sn-meta-scan" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-meta-scan" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><!--googleoff: all--><b>Story Number</b>: 3<br><b>Published in</b>: The Strand Magazine in July 1891<br><b>Collected in</b>: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes<!--googleon: all--></span></p>
<p>
<span sid='50805' title='50805'>To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. </span>
<span sid='50806' title='50806'>I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. </span>
<span sid='50807' title='50807'>In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. </span>
<span sid='50808' title='50808'>It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. </span>
<span sid='50809' title='50809'>All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise, but admirably balanced mind. </span>
<span sid='50810' title='50810'>He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen: but, as a lover, he would have placed himself in a false position. </span>
<span sid='50811' title='50811'>He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. </span>
<span sid='50812' title='50812'>They were admirable things for the observer - excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. </span>
<span sid='50813' title='50813'>But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. </span>
<span sid='50814' title='50814'>Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. </span>
<span sid='50815' title='50815'>And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50816' title='50816'>I had seen little of Holmes lately. </span>
<span sid='50817' title='50817'>My marriage had drifted us away from each other. </span>
<span sid='50818' title='50818'>My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention; while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bohemia&t=h'>Bohemia</a>n soul, remained in our lodgings in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. </span>
<span sid='50819' title='50819'>He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries, which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. </span>
<span sid='50820' title='50820'>From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Odessa&t=h'>Odessa</a> in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Trincomalee&t=h'>Trincomalee</a>, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Holland&t=h'>Holland</a>. </span>
<span sid='50821' title='50821'>Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50822' title='50822'>One night - it was on the 20th of March, 1888 - I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='50823' title='50823'>As I passed the well remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. </span>
<span sid='50824' title='50824'>His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. </span>
<span sid='50825' title='50825'>He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest, and his hands clasped behind him. </span>
<span sid='50826' title='50826'>To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. </span>
<span sid='50827' title='50827'>He was at work again. </span>
<span sid='50828' title='50828'>He had risen out of his drug-created dreams, and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. </span>
<span sid='50829' title='50829'>I rang the bell, and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50830' title='50830'>His manner was not effusive. </span>
<span sid='50831' title='50831'>It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. </span>
<span sid='50832' title='50832'>With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an arm-chair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. </span>
<span sid='50833' title='50833'>Then he stood before the fire, and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50834' title='50834'>'Wedlock suits you,' he remarked. </span>
<span sid='50835' title='50835'>'I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50836' title='50836'>'Seven,' I answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50837' title='50837'>'Indeed, I should have thought a little more. </span>
<span sid='50838' title='50838'>Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. </span>
<span sid='50839' title='50839'>And in practice again, I observe. </span>
<span sid='50840' title='50840'>You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50841' title='50841'>'Then, how do you know?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50842' title='50842'>'I see it, I deduce it. </span>
<span sid='50843' title='50843'>How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50844' title='50844'>'My dear Holmes,' said I, 'this is too much. </span>
<span sid='50845' title='50845'>You would certainly have been burned had you lived a few centuries ago. </span>
<span sid='50846' title='50846'>It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess; but, as I have changed my clothes, I can't imagine how you deduce it. </span>
<span sid='50847' title='50847'>As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice; but there again I fail to see how you work it out.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50848' title='50848'>He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long nervous hands together.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50849' title='50849'>'It is simplicity itself,' said he; 'my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. </span>
<span sid='50850' title='50850'>Obviously they have been caused by some one who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. </span>
<span sid='50851' title='50851'>Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> slavey. </span>
<span sid='50852' title='50852'>As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the side of his top hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull indeed if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50853' title='50853'>I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. </span>
<span sid='50854' title='50854'>'When I hear you give your reasons,' I remarked, 'the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled, until you explain your process. </span>
<span sid='50855' title='50855'>And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50856' title='50856'>'Quite so,' he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an arm-chair. </span>
<span sid='50857' title='50857'>'You see, but you do not observe. </span>
<span sid='50858' title='50858'>The distinction is clear. </span>
<span sid='50859' title='50859'>For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50860' title='50860'>'Frequently.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50861' title='50861'>'How often?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50862' title='50862'>'Well, some hundreds of times.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50863' title='50863'>'Then how many are there?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50864' title='50864'>'How many! </span>
<span sid='50865' title='50865'>I don't know.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50866' title='50866'>'Quite so! </span>
<span sid='50867' title='50867'>You have not observed. </span>
<span sid='50868' title='50868'>And yet you have seen. </span>
<span sid='50869' title='50869'>That is just nay point. </span>
<span sid='50870' title='50870'>Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. </span>
<span sid='50871' title='50871'>By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.' </span>
<span sid='50872' title='50872'>He threw over a sheet of thick pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table. </span>
<span sid='50873' title='50873'>'It came by the last post,' said he. </span>
<span sid='50874' title='50874'>'Read it aloud.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50875' title='50875'>The note was undated, and without either signature or address.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50876' title='50876'>'There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o'clock,' it said, 'a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. </span>
<span sid='50877' title='50877'>Your recent services to one of the Royal Houses of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a> have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. </span>
<span sid='50878' title='50878'>This account of you we have from all quarters received. </span>
<span sid='50879' title='50879'>Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50880' title='50880'>'This is indeed a mystery,' I remarked. </span>
<span sid='50881' title='50881'>'What do you imagine that it means?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50882' title='50882'>'I have no data yet. </span>
<span sid='50883' title='50883'>It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data. </span>
<span sid='50884' title='50884'>Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. </span>
<span sid='50885' title='50885'>But the note itself. </span>
<span sid='50886' title='50886'>What do you deduce from it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50887' title='50887'>I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50888' title='50888'>'The man who wrote it was presumably well-to-do.' I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes. </span>
<span sid='50889' title='50889'>'Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. </span>
<span sid='50890' title='50890'>It is peculiarly strong and stiff.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50891' title='50891'>'Peculiar - that is the very word,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='50892' title='50892'>'It is not an English paper at all. </span>
<span sid='50893' title='50893'>Hold it up to the light.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50894' title='50894'>I did so, and saw a large E with a small g, a P, and a large G with a small t woven into the texture of the paper.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50895' title='50895'>'What do you make of that?' asked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50896' title='50896'>'The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50897' title='50897'>'Not at all. </span>
<span sid='50898' title='50898'>The G with the small t stands for "Gesellschaft," which is the German for "Company." </span>
<span sid='50899' title='50899'>It is a customary contraction like our "Co." </span>
<span sid='50900' title='50900'>P, of course, stands for "Papier." </span>
<span sid='50901' title='50901'>Now for the Eg. </span>
<span sid='50902' title='50902'>Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer.' </span>
<span sid='50903' title='50903'>He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. </span>
<span sid='50904' title='50904'>'Eglow, Eglonitz - here we are, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Egria&t=h'>Egria</a>. </span>
<span sid='50905' title='50905'>It is in a German-speaking country - in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bohemia&t=h'>Bohemia</a>, not far from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Carlsbad&t=h'>Carlsbad</a>. </span>
<span sid='50906' title='50906'>"Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass factories and paper mills." </span>
<span sid='50907' title='50907'>Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?' </span>
<span sid='50908' title='50908'>His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50909' title='50909'>'The paper was made in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bohemia&t=h'>Bohemia</a>,' I said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50910' title='50910'>'Precisely. </span>
<span sid='50911' title='50911'>And the man who wrote the note is a German. </span>
<span sid='50912' title='50912'>Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence - "This account of you we have from all quarters received." </span>
<span sid='50913' title='50913'>A Frenchman or <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Russia&t=h'>Russia</a>n could not have written that. </span>
<span sid='50914' title='50914'>It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. </span>
<span sid='50915' title='50915'>It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bohemia&t=h'>Bohemia</a>n paper, and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. </span>
<span sid='50916' title='50916'>And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50917' title='50917'>As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and grating wheels against the kerb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. </span>
<span sid='50918' title='50918'>Holmes whistled.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50919' title='50919'>'A pair by the sound,' said he. </span>
<span sid='50920' title='50920'>'Yes,' he continued, glancing out of the window. </span>
<span sid='50921' title='50921'>'A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. </span>
<span sid='50922' title='50922'>A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. </span>
<span sid='50923' title='50923'>There's money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50924' title='50924'>'I think that I had better go, Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50925' title='50925'>'Not a bit, Doctor. </span>
<span sid='50926' title='50926'>Stay where you are. </span>
<span sid='50927' title='50927'>I am lost without my Boswell. </span>
<span sid='50928' title='50928'>And this promises to be interesting. </span>
<span sid='50929' title='50929'>It would be a pity to miss it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50930' title='50930'>'But your client-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50931' title='50931'>'Never mind him. </span>
<span sid='50932' title='50932'>I may want your help, and so may he. </span>
<span sid='50933' title='50933'>Here he comes. </span>
<span sid='50934' title='50934'>Sit down in that arm-chair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50935' title='50935'>A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. </span>
<span sid='50936' title='50936'>Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50937' title='50937'>'Come in!' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50938' title='50938'>A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. </span>
<span sid='50939' title='50939'>His dress was rich with a richness which would, in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. </span>
<span sid='50940' title='50940'>Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk, and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. </span>
<span sid='50941' title='50941'>Boots which extended half-way up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. </span>
<span sid='50942' title='50942'>He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheek-bones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to as he entered. </span>
<span sid='50943' title='50943'>From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long straight chin, suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50944' title='50944'>'You had my note?' he asked, with a deep, harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. </span>
<span sid='50945' title='50945'>'I told you that I would call.' </span>
<span sid='50946' title='50946'>He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50947' title='50947'>'Pray take a seat,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='50948' title='50948'>'This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. </span>
<span sid='50949' title='50949'>Whom have I the honour to address?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50950' title='50950'>'You may address me as the Count von Kramm, a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bohemia&t=h'>Bohemia</a>n nobleman. </span>
<span sid='50951' title='50951'>I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. </span>
<span sid='50952' title='50952'>If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50953' title='50953'>I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. </span>
<span sid='50954' title='50954'>'It is both, or none,' said he. </span>
<span sid='50955' title='50955'>'You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50956' title='50956'>The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. </span>
<span sid='50957' title='50957'>'Then I must begin,' said he, 'by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years, at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. </span>
<span sid='50958' title='50958'>At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight that it may have an influence upon <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>an history.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50959' title='50959'>'I promise,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50960' title='50960'>'And I.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50961' title='50961'>'You will excuse this mask,' continued our strange visitor. </span>
<span sid='50962' title='50962'>'The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50963' title='50963'>'I was aware of it,' said Holmes dryly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50964' title='50964'>'The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>. </span>
<span sid='50965' title='50965'>To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bohemia&t=h'>Bohemia</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50966' title='50966'>'I was also aware of that,' murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his arm-chair, and closing his eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50967' title='50967'>Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner, and most energetic agent in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>. </span>
<span sid='50968' title='50968'>Holmes slowly reopened his eyes, and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50969' title='50969'>'If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,' he remarked, 'I should be better able to advise you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50970' title='50970'>The man sprang from his chair, and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. </span>
<span sid='50971' title='50971'>Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. </span>
<span sid='50972' title='50972'>'You are right,' he cried, 'I am the King. </span>
<span sid='50973' title='50973'>Why should I attempt to conceal it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50974' title='50974'>'Why, indeed?' murmured Holmes. </span>
<span sid='50975' title='50975'>'Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Falstein, and hereditary King of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bohemia&t=h'>Bohemia</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50976' title='50976'>'But you can understand,' said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high, white forehead, 'you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. </span>
<span sid='50977' title='50977'>Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. </span>
<span sid='50978' title='50978'>I have come incognito from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Prague&t=h'>Prague</a> for the purpose of consulting you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50979' title='50979'>'Then, pray consult,' said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50980' title='50980'>'The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Warsaw&t=h'>Warsaw</a>, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress Irene Adler. </span>
<span sid='50981' title='50981'>The name is no doubt familiar to you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50982' title='50982'>'Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,' murmured Holmes, without opening his eyes. </span>
<span sid='50983' title='50983'>For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. </span>
<span sid='50984' title='50984'>In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew Rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='50985' title='50985'>'Let me see,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='50986' title='50986'>'Hum! </span>
<span sid='50987' title='50987'>Born in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=New Jersey&t=h'>New Jersey</a> in the year 1858. </span>
<span sid='50988' title='50988'>Contralto - hum! </span>
<span sid='50989' title='50989'>La Scala, hum! </span>
<span sid='50990' title='50990'>Prima donna Imperial Opera of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Warsaw&t=h'>Warsaw</a> - Yes! </span>
<span sid='50991' title='50991'>Retired from operatic stage - ha! </span>
<span sid='50992' title='50992'>Living in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> - quite so! </span>
<span sid='50993' title='50993'>Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50994' title='50994'>'Precisely so. </span>
<span sid='50995' title='50995'>But how-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50996' title='50996'>'Was there a secret marriage?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50997' title='50997'>'None.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50998' title='50998'>'No legal papers or certificates?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='50999' title='50999'>'None.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51000' title='51000'>'Then I fail to follow Your Majesty. </span>
<span sid='51001' title='51001'>If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51002' title='51002'>'There is the writing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51003' title='51003'>'Pooh, pooh! </span>
<span sid='51004' title='51004'>Forgery.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51005' title='51005'>'My private note-paper.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51006' title='51006'>'Stolen.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51007' title='51007'>'My own seal.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51008' title='51008'>'Imitated.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51009' title='51009'>'My photograph.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51010' title='51010'>'Bought.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51011' title='51011'>'We were both in the photograph.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51012' title='51012'>'Oh, dear! </span>
<span sid='51013' title='51013'>That is very bad! </span>
<span sid='51014' title='51014'>Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51015' title='51015'>'I was mad - insane.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51016' title='51016'>'You have compromised yourself seriously.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51017' title='51017'>'I was only Crown Prince then. </span>
<span sid='51018' title='51018'>I was young. </span>
<span sid='51019' title='51019'>I am but thirty now.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51020' title='51020'>'It must be recovered.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51021' title='51021'>'We have tried and failed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51022' title='51022'>'Your Majesty must pay. </span>
<span sid='51023' title='51023'>It must be bought.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51024' title='51024'>'She will not sell.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51025' title='51025'>'Stolen, then.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51026' title='51026'>'Five attempts have been made. </span>
<span sid='51027' title='51027'>Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. </span>
<span sid='51028' title='51028'>Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. </span>
<span sid='51029' title='51029'>Twice she has been waylaid. </span>
<span sid='51030' title='51030'>There has been no result.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51031' title='51031'>'No sign of it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51032' title='51032'>'Absolutely none.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51033' title='51033'>Holmes laughed. </span>
<span sid='51034' title='51034'>'It is quite a pretty little problem,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51035' title='51035'>'But a very serious one to me,' returned the King, reproachfully.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51036' title='51036'>'Very, indeed. </span>
<span sid='51037' title='51037'>And what does she propose to do with the photograph?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51038' title='51038'>'To ruin me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51039' title='51039'>'But how?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51040' title='51040'>'I am about to be married.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51041' title='51041'>'So I have heard.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51042' title='51042'>'To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scandinavia&t=h'>Scandinavia</a>. </span>
<span sid='51043' title='51043'>You may know the strict principles of her family. </span>
<span sid='51044' title='51044'>She is herself the very soul of delicacy. </span>
<span sid='51045' title='51045'>A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51046' title='51046'>'And Irene Adler?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51047' title='51047'>'Threatens to send them the photograph. </span>
<span sid='51048' title='51048'>And she will do it. </span>
<span sid='51049' title='51049'>I know that she will do it. </span>
<span sid='51050' title='51050'>You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. </span>
<span sid='51051' title='51051'>She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men. </span>
<span sid='51052' title='51052'>Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go - none.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51053' title='51053'>'You are sure that she has not sent it yet?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51054' title='51054'>'I am sure.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51055' title='51055'>'And why?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51056' title='51056'>'Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. </span>
<span sid='51057' title='51057'>That will be next Monday.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51058' title='51058'>'Oh, then, we have three days yet,' said Holmes, with a yawn. </span>
<span sid='51059' title='51059'>'That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present. </span>
<span sid='51060' title='51060'>Your Majesty will, of course, stay in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> for the present?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51061' title='51061'>'Certainly. </span>
<span sid='51062' title='51062'>You will find me at the Langham, under the name of the Count von Kramm.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51063' title='51063'>'Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51064' title='51064'>'Pray do so. </span>
<span sid='51065' title='51065'>I shall be all anxiety.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51066' title='51066'>'Then, as to money?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51067' title='51067'>'You have carte blanche.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51068' title='51068'>'Absolutely?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51069' title='51069'>'I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51070' title='51070'>'And for present expenses?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51071' title='51071'>The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak, and laid it on the table.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51072' title='51072'>'There are three hundred pounds in gold, and seven hundred in notes,' he said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51073' title='51073'>Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his notebook, and handed it to him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51074' title='51074'>'And mademoiselle's address?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51075' title='51075'>'Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=St. John's Wood&t=h'>St. John's Wood</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51076' title='51076'>Holmes took a note of it. </span>
<span sid='51077' title='51077'>'One other question,' said he. </span>
<span sid='51078' title='51078'>'Was the photograph a cabinet?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51079' title='51079'>'It was.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51080' title='51080'>'Then, good night, Your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. </span>
<span sid='51081' title='51081'>And good night, Watson,' he added, as the wheels of the Royal brougham rolled down the street. </span>
<span sid='51082' title='51082'>'If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon, at three o'clock, I should like to chat this little matter over with you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51083' title='51083'>At three o'clock precisely I was at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>, but Holmes had not yet returned. </span>
<span sid='51084' title='51084'>The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. </span>
<span sid='51085' title='51085'>I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. </span>
<span sid='51086' title='51086'>I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have elsewhere recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own. </span>
<span sid='51087' title='51087'>Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. </span>
<span sid='51088' title='51088'>So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51089' title='51089'>It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. </span>
<span sid='51090' title='51090'>Accustomed as I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he. </span>
<span sid='51091' title='51091'>With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. </span>
<span sid='51092' title='51092'>Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire, and laughed heartily for some minutes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51093' title='51093'>'Well, really!' he cried, and then he choked; and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51094' title='51094'>'What is it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51095' title='51095'>'It's quite too funny. </span>
<span sid='51096' title='51096'>I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51097' title='51097'>'I can't imagine. </span>
<span sid='51098' title='51098'>I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51099' title='51099'>'Quite so, but the sequel was rather unusual. </span>
<span sid='51100' title='51100'>I will tell you, however. </span>
<span sid='51101' title='51101'>I left the house a little after eight o'clock this morning, in the character of a groom out of work. </span>
<span sid='51102' title='51102'>There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. </span>
<span sid='51103' title='51103'>Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. </span>
<span sid='51104' title='51104'>I soon found Briony Lodge. </span>
<span sid='51105' title='51105'>It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two stories. </span>
<span sid='51106' title='51106'>Chubb lock to the door. </span>
<span sid='51107' title='51107'>Large sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open. </span>
<span sid='51108' title='51108'>Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house. </span>
<span sid='51109' title='51109'>I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51110' title='51110'>'I then lounged down the street, and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. </span>
<span sid='51111' title='51111'>I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and I received in exchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51112' title='51112'>'And what of Irene Adler?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51113' title='51113'>'Oh, she has turned all the men's heads down in that part. </span>
<span sid='51114' title='51114'>She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. </span>
<span sid='51115' title='51115'>So say the Serpentine Mews, to a man. </span>
<span sid='51116' title='51116'>She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. </span>
<span sid='51117' title='51117'>Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings. </span>
<span sid='51118' title='51118'>Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. </span>
<span sid='51119' title='51119'>He is dark, handsome, and dashing; never calls less than once a day, and often twice. </span>
<span sid='51120' title='51120'>He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Inner Temple&t=h'>Inner Temple</a>. </span>
<span sid='51121' title='51121'>See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. </span>
<span sid='51122' title='51122'>They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine Mews, and knew all about him. </span>
<span sid='51123' title='51123'>When I had listened to all that they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of campaign.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51124' title='51124'>'This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. </span>
<span sid='51125' title='51125'>He was a lawyer. </span>
<span sid='51126' title='51126'>That sounded ominous. </span>
<span sid='51127' title='51127'>What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits? </span>
<span sid='51128' title='51128'>Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? </span>
<span sid='51129' title='51129'>If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. </span>
<span sid='51130' title='51130'>If the latter, it was less likely. </span>
<span sid='51131' title='51131'>On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the Temple. </span>
<span sid='51132' title='51132'>It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry. </span>
<span sid='51133' title='51133'>I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the situation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51134' title='51134'>'I am following you closely,' I answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51135' title='51135'>'I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. </span>
<span sid='51136' title='51136'>He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached - evidently the man of whom I had heard. </span>
<span sid='51137' title='51137'>He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51138' title='51138'>'He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him, in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly and waving his arms. </span>
<span sid='51139' title='51139'>Of her I could see nothing. </span>
<span sid='51140' title='51140'>Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. </span>
<span sid='51141' title='51141'>As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly. </span>
<span sid='51142' title='51142'>'Drive like the devil," he shouted, "first to Gross and Hankey's in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Regent Street&t=h'>Regent Street</a>, and then to the church of St. Monica in the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Edgware Road&t=h'>Edgware Road</a>. </span>
<span sid='51143' title='51143'>Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51144' title='51144'>'Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them, when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. </span>
<span sid='51145' title='51145'>It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. </span>
<span sid='51146' title='51146'>I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51147' title='51147'>'"The Church of St. Monica, John," she cried, "and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes."</span>
<p>
<span sid='51148' title='51148'>'This was quite too good to lose, Watson. </span>
<span sid='51149' title='51149'>I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau, when a cab came through the street. </span>
<span sid='51150' title='51150'>The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare; but I jumped in before he could object. </span>
<span sid='51151' title='51151'>"The Church of St. Monica," said I, "and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes." </span>
<span sid='51152' title='51152'>It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51153' title='51153'>'My cabby drove fast. </span>
<span sid='51154' title='51154'>I don't think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us. </span>
<span sid='51155' title='51155'>The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. </span>
<span sid='51156' title='51156'>I paid the man and hurried into the church. </span>
<span sid='51157' title='51157'>There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed, and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. </span>
<span sid='51158' title='51158'>They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. </span>
<span sid='51159' title='51159'>I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church. </span>
<span sid='51160' title='51160'>Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51161' title='51161'>'"Thank God!" he cried. </span>
<span sid='51162' title='51162'>"You'll do. </span>
<span sid='51163' title='51163'>Come! </span>
<span sid='51164' title='51164'>Come!"</span>
<p>
<span sid='51165' title='51165'>'"What then?" I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51166' title='51166'>'"Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won't be legal."</span>
<p>
<span sid='51167' title='51167'>'I was half dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was, I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. </span>
<span sid='51168' title='51168'>It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. </span>
<span sid='51169' title='51169'>It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. </span>
<span sid='51170' title='51170'>It seems that there had been some informality about their licence, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man. </span>
<span sid='51171' title='51171'>The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51172' title='51172'>'This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,' said I; 'and what then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51173' title='51173'>'Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. </span>
<span sid='51174' title='51174'>It looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part. </span>
<span sid='51175' title='51175'>At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. </span>
<span sid='51176' title='51176'>"I shall drive out in the Park at five as usual," she said as she left him. </span>
<span sid='51177' title='51177'>I heard no more. </span>
<span sid='51178' title='51178'>They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51179' title='51179'>'Which are?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51180' title='51180'>'Some cold beef and a glass of beer,' he answered, ringing the bell. </span>
<span sid='51181' title='51181'>'I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening. </span>
<span sid='51182' title='51182'>By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51183' title='51183'>'I shall be delighted.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51184' title='51184'>'You don't mind breaking the law?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51185' title='51185'>'Not in the least.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51186' title='51186'>'Nor running a chance of arrest?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51187' title='51187'>'Not in a good cause.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51188' title='51188'>'Oh, the cause is excellent!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51189' title='51189'>'Then I am your man.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51190' title='51190'>'I was sure that I might rely on you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51191' title='51191'>'But what is it you wish?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51192' title='51192'>'When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you. </span>
<span sid='51193' title='51193'>Now,' he said, as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided, 'I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time. </span>
<span sid='51194' title='51194'>It is nearly five now. </span>
<span sid='51195' title='51195'>In two hours we must be on the scene of action. </span>
<span sid='51196' title='51196'>Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. </span>
<span sid='51197' title='51197'>We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51198' title='51198'>'And what then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51199' title='51199'>'You must leave that to me. </span>
<span sid='51200' title='51200'>I have already arranged what is to occur. </span>
<span sid='51201' title='51201'>There is only one point on which I must insist. </span>
<span sid='51202' title='51202'>You must not interfere, come what may. </span>
<span sid='51203' title='51203'>You understand?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51204' title='51204'>'I am to be neutral?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51205' title='51205'>'To do nothing whatever. </span>
<span sid='51206' title='51206'>There will probably be some small unpleasantness. </span>
<span sid='51207' title='51207'>Do not join in it. </span>
<span sid='51208' title='51208'>It will end in my being conveyed into the house. </span>
<span sid='51209' title='51209'>Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open. </span>
<span sid='51210' title='51210'>You are to station yourself close to that open window.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51211' title='51211'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51212' title='51212'>'You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51213' title='51213'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51214' title='51214'>'And when I raise my hand - so - you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. </span>
<span sid='51215' title='51215'>You quite follow me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51216' title='51216'>'Entirely.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51217' title='51217'>'It is nothing very formidable,' he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. </span>
<span sid='51218' title='51218'>'It is an ordinary plumber's smoke rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. </span>
<span sid='51219' title='51219'>Your task is confined to that. </span>
<span sid='51220' title='51220'>When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people. </span>
<span sid='51221' title='51221'>You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. </span>
<span sid='51222' title='51222'>I hope that I have made myself clear?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51223' title='51223'>'I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and, at the signal, to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to await you at the corner of the street.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51224' title='51224'>'Precisely.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51225' title='51225'>'Then you may entirely rely on me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51226' title='51226'>'That is excellent. </span>
<span sid='51227' title='51227'>I think perhaps it is almost time that I prepared for the new rÃ´le I have to play.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51228' title='51228'>He disappeared into his bedroom, and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. </span>
<span sid='51229' title='51229'>His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity, were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. </span>
<span sid='51230' title='51230'>It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. </span>
<span sid='51231' title='51231'>His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. </span>
<span sid='51232' title='51232'>The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51233' title='51233'>It was a quarter past six when we left <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. </span>
<span sid='51234' title='51234'>It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. </span>
<span sid='51235' title='51235'>The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes's succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. </span>
<span sid='51236' title='51236'>On the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. </span>
<span sid='51237' title='51237'>There was a group of shabbily-dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51238' title='51238'>'You see,' remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, 'this marriage rather simplifies matters. </span>
<span sid='51239' title='51239'>The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. </span>
<span sid='51240' title='51240'>The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his Princess. </span>
<span sid='51241' title='51241'>Now the question is - Where are we to find the photograph?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51242' title='51242'>'Where, indeed?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51243' title='51243'>'It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. </span>
<span sid='51244' title='51244'>It is cabinet size. </span>
<span sid='51245' title='51245'>Too large for easy concealment about a woman's dress. </span>
<span sid='51246' title='51246'>She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. </span>
<span sid='51247' title='51247'>Two attempts of the sort have already been made. </span>
<span sid='51248' title='51248'>We may take it then that she does not carry it about with her.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51249' title='51249'>'Where, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51250' title='51250'>'Her banker or her lawyer. </span>
<span sid='51251' title='51251'>There is that double possibility. </span>
<span sid='51252' title='51252'>But I am inclined to think neither. </span>
<span sid='51253' title='51253'>Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting. </span>
<span sid='51254' title='51254'>Why should she hand it over to anyone else? </span>
<span sid='51255' title='51255'>She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. </span>
<span sid='51256' title='51256'>Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. </span>
<span sid='51257' title='51257'>It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. </span>
<span sid='51258' title='51258'>It must be in her own house.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51259' title='51259'>'But it has twice been burgled.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51260' title='51260'>'Pshaw! </span>
<span sid='51261' title='51261'>They did not know how to look.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51262' title='51262'>'But how will you look?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51263' title='51263'>'I will not look.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51264' title='51264'>'What then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51265' title='51265'>'I will get her to show me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51266' title='51266'>'But she will refuse.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51267' title='51267'>'She will not be able to. </span>
<span sid='51268' title='51268'>But I hear the rumble of wheels. </span>
<span sid='51269' title='51269'>It is her carriage. </span>
<span sid='51270' title='51270'>Now carry out my orders to the letter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51271' title='51271'>As he spoke, the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue. </span>
<span sid='51272' title='51272'>It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. </span>
<span sid='51273' title='51273'>As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer who had rushed up with the same intention. </span>
<span sid='51274' title='51274'>A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. </span>
<span sid='51275' title='51275'>A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men who struck savagely at each other with their lists and sticks. </span>
<span sid='51276' title='51276'>Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached her, he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. </span>
<span sid='51277' title='51277'>At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better dressed people who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. </span>
<span sid='51278' title='51278'>Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51279' title='51279'>'Is the poor gentleman much hurt?' she asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51280' title='51280'>'He is dead,' cried several voices.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51281' title='51281'>'No, no, there's life in him,' shouted another. </span>
<span sid='51282' title='51282'>'But he'll be gone before you can get him to hospital.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51283' title='51283'>'He's a brave fellow,' said a woman. </span>
<span sid='51284' title='51284'>'They would have had the lady's purse and watch if it hadn't been for him. </span>
<span sid='51285' title='51285'>They were a gang, and a rough one, too. </span>
<span sid='51286' title='51286'>Ah, he's breathing now.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51287' title='51287'>'He can't lie in the street. </span>
<span sid='51288' title='51288'>May we bring him in, marm?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51289' title='51289'>'Surely. </span>
<span sid='51290' title='51290'>Bring him into the sitting-room. </span>
<span sid='51291' title='51291'>There is a comfortable sofa. </span>
<span sid='51292' title='51292'>This way, please!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51293' title='51293'>Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge, and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window. </span>
<span sid='51294' title='51294'>The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. </span>
<span sid='51295' title='51295'>I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man. </span>
<span sid='51296' title='51296'>And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had entrusted to me. </span>
<span sid='51297' title='51297'>I hardened my heart and took the smoke rocket from under my ulster. </span>
<span sid='51298' title='51298'>After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. </span>
<span sid='51299' title='51299'>We are but preventing her from injuring another.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51300' title='51300'>Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in want of air. </span>
<span sid='51301' title='51301'>A maid rushed across and threw open the window. </span>
<span sid='51302' title='51302'>At the same instant I saw him raise his hand, and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of 'Fire.' </span>
<span sid='51303' title='51303'>The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill - gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids - joined in a general shriek of 'Fire.' </span>
<span sid='51304' title='51304'>Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room, and out at the open window. </span>
<span sid='51305' title='51305'>I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within, assuring them that it was a false alarm. </span>
<span sid='51306' title='51306'>Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend's arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of the uproar. </span>
<span sid='51307' title='51307'>He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes, until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Edgware Road&t=h'>Edgware Road</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51308' title='51308'>'You did it very nicely, Doctor,' he remarked. </span>
<span sid='51309' title='51309'>'Nothing could have been better. </span>
<span sid='51310' title='51310'>It is all right.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51311' title='51311'>'You have the photograph!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51312' title='51312'>'I know where it is.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51313' title='51313'>'And how did you find out?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51314' title='51314'>'She showed me, as I told you that she would.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51315' title='51315'>'I am still in the dark.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51316' title='51316'>'I do not wish to make a mystery,' said he, laughing. </span>
<span sid='51317' title='51317'>'The matter was perfectly simple. </span>
<span sid='51318' title='51318'>You, of course, saw that every one in the street was an accomplice. </span>
<span sid='51319' title='51319'>They were all engaged for the evening.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51320' title='51320'>'I guessed as much.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51321' title='51321'>'Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand. </span>
<span sid='51322' title='51322'>I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. </span>
<span sid='51323' title='51323'>It is an old trick.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51324' title='51324'>'That also I could fathom.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51325' title='51325'>'Then they carried me in. </span>
<span sid='51326' title='51326'>She was bound to have me in. </span>
<span sid='51327' title='51327'>What else could she do? </span>
<span sid='51328' title='51328'>And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected. </span>
<span sid='51329' title='51329'>It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which. </span>
<span sid='51330' title='51330'>They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window and you had your chance.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51331' title='51331'>'How did that help you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51332' title='51332'>'It was all-important. </span>
<span sid='51333' title='51333'>When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. </span>
<span sid='51334' title='51334'>It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. </span>
<span sid='51335' title='51335'>In the case of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Darlington&t=h'>Darlington</a> Substitution Scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. </span>
<span sid='51336' title='51336'>A married woman grabs at her baby- an unmarried one reaches for her jewel box. </span>
<span sid='51337' title='51337'>Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. </span>
<span sid='51338' title='51338'>She would rush to secure it. </span>
<span sid='51339' title='51339'>The alarm of fire was admirably done. </span>
<span sid='51340' title='51340'>The smoke and shouting was enough to shake nerves of steel. </span>
<span sid='51341' title='51341'>She responded beautifully. </span>
<span sid='51342' title='51342'>The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. </span>
<span sid='51343' title='51343'>She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out. </span>
<span sid='51344' title='51344'>When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. </span>
<span sid='51345' title='51345'>I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. </span>
<span sid='51346' title='51346'>I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait. </span>
<span sid='51347' title='51347'>A little over-precipitance may ruin all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51348' title='51348'>'And now?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51349' title='51349'>'Our quest is practically finished. </span>
<span sid='51350' title='51350'>I shall call with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. </span>
<span sid='51351' title='51351'>We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. </span>
<span sid='51352' title='51352'>It might be a satisfaction to His Majesty to regain it with his own hands.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51353' title='51353'>'And when will you call?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51354' title='51354'>'At eight in the morning. </span>
<span sid='51355' title='51355'>She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field. </span>
<span sid='51356' title='51356'>Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits. </span>
<span sid='51357' title='51357'>I must wire to the King without delay.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51358' title='51358'>We had reached <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>, and had stopped at the door. </span>
<span sid='51359' title='51359'>He was searching his pockets for the key, when some one passing said:</span>
<p>
<span sid='51360' title='51360'>'Good night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51361' title='51361'>There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51362' title='51362'>'I've heard that voice before,' said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit street. </span>
<span sid='51363' title='51363'>'Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51364' title='51364'>I slept at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee when the King of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bohemia&t=h'>Bohemia</a> rushed into the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51365' title='51365'>'You have really got it!' he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder, and looking eagerly into his face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51366' title='51366'>'Not yet.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51367' title='51367'>'But you have hopes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51368' title='51368'>'I have hopes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51369' title='51369'>'Then, come. </span>
<span sid='51370' title='51370'>I am all impatience to be gone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51371' title='51371'>'We must have a cab.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51372' title='51372'>'No, my brougham is waiting.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51373' title='51373'>'Then that will simplify matters.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51374' title='51374'>We descended, and started off once more for Briony Lodge.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51375' title='51375'>'Irene Adler is married,' remarked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51376' title='51376'>'Married! </span>
<span sid='51377' title='51377'>When?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51378' title='51378'>'Yesterday.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51379' title='51379'>'But to whom?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51380' title='51380'>'To an English lawyer named Norton.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51381' title='51381'>'But she could not love him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51382' title='51382'>'I am in hopes that she does.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51383' title='51383'>'And why in hopes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51384' title='51384'>'Because it would spare Your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. </span>
<span sid='51385' title='51385'>If the lady loves her husband, she does not love Your Majesty. </span>
<span sid='51386' title='51386'>If she does not love Your Majesty there is no reason why she should interfere with Your Majesty's plan.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51387' title='51387'>'It is true. </span>
<span sid='51388' title='51388'>And yet! </span>
<span sid='51389' title='51389'>Well! </span>
<span sid='51390' title='51390'>I wish she had been of my own station! </span>
<span sid='51391' title='51391'>What a queen she would have made!' </span>
<span sid='51392' title='51392'>He relapsed into a moody silence which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51393' title='51393'>The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps. </span>
<span sid='51394' title='51394'>She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51395' title='51395'>'Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?' said she.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51396' title='51396'>'I am Mr. Holmes,' answered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51397' title='51397'>'Indeed! </span>
<span sid='51398' title='51398'>My mistress told me that you were likely to call. </span>
<span sid='51399' title='51399'>She left this morning with her husband, by the 5.15 train from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Charing Cross&t=h'>Charing Cross</a>, for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Continent&t=h'>the Continent</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51400' title='51400'>'What!' </span>
<span sid='51401' title='51401'>Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise. </span>
<span sid='51402' title='51402'>'Do you mean that she has left <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51403' title='51403'>'Never to return.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51404' title='51404'>'And the papers?' asked the King hoarsely. </span>
<span sid='51405' title='51405'>'All is lost.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51406' title='51406'>'We shall see.' </span>
<span sid='51407' title='51407'>He pushed past the servant, and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. </span>
<span sid='51408' title='51408'>The furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves, and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. </span>
<span sid='51409' title='51409'>Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. </span>
<span sid='51410' title='51410'>The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to ' Sherlock Holmes, Esq. </span>
<span sid='51411' title='51411'>To be left till called for.' </span>
<span sid='51412' title='51412'>My friend tore it open and we all three read it together. </span>
<span sid='51413' title='51413'>It was dated at midnight of the preceding night, and ran in this way:</span>
<p>
<span sid='51414' title='51414'>MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES, </span>
<span sid='51415' title='51415'>- You really did it very well. </span>
<span sid='51416' title='51416'>You took me in completely. </span>
<span sid='51417' title='51417'>Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion. </span>
<span sid='51418' title='51418'>But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. </span>
<span sid='51419' title='51419'>I had been warned against you months ago. </span>
<span sid='51420' title='51420'>I had been told that if the King employed an agent, it would certainly be you. </span>
<span sid='51421' title='51421'>And your address had been given me. </span>
<span sid='51422' title='51422'>Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. </span>
<span sid='51423' title='51423'>Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. </span>
<span sid='51424' title='51424'>But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. </span>
<span sid='51425' title='51425'>Male costume is nothing new to me. </span>
<span sid='51426' title='51426'>I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. </span>
<span sid='51427' title='51427'>I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came down just as you departed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51428' title='51428'>Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='51429' title='51429'>Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good night, and started for the Temple to see my husband.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51430' title='51430'>We both thought the best resource was flight when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call to-morrow. </span>
<span sid='51431' title='51431'>As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. </span>
<span sid='51432' title='51432'>I love and am loved by a better man than he. </span>
<span sid='51433' title='51433'>The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. </span>
<span sid='51434' title='51434'>I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future. </span>
<span sid='51435' title='51435'>I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes, very truly yours,</span>
<p>
<span sid='51436' title='51436'>IRENE NORTON, nÃ©e ADLER.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51437' title='51437'>'What a woman - oh, what a woman!' cried the King of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bohemia&t=h'>Bohemia</a>, when we had all three read this epistle. </span>
<span sid='51438' title='51438'>'Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was? </span>
<span sid='51439' title='51439'>Would she not have made an admirable queen? </span>
<span sid='51440' title='51440'>Is it not a pity she was not on my level?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51441' title='51441'>'From what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very different level to Your Majesty,' said Holmes, coldly. </span>
<span sid='51442' title='51442'>'I am sorry that I have not been able to bring Your Majesty's business to a more successful conclusion.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51443' title='51443'>'On the contrary, my dear sir,' cried the King. </span>
<span sid='51444' title='51444'>'Nothing could be more successful. </span>
<span sid='51445' title='51445'>I know that her word is inviolate. </span>
<span sid='51446' title='51446'>The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51447' title='51447'>'I am glad to hear Your Majesty say so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51448' title='51448'>'I am immensely indebted to you. </span>
<span sid='51449' title='51449'>Pray tell me in what way I can reward you. </span>
<span sid='51450' title='51450'>This ring-' </span>
<span sid='51451' title='51451'>He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51452' title='51452'>'Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51453' title='51453'>'You have but to name it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51454' title='51454'>'This photograph!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51455' title='51455'>The King stared at him in amazement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51456' title='51456'>'Irene's photograph!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='51457' title='51457'>'Certainly, if you wish it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='51458' title='51458'>'I thank Your Majesty. </span>
<span sid='51459' title='51459'>Then there is no more to be done in the matter. </span>
<span sid='51460' title='51460'>I have the honour to wish you a very good morning.' </span>
<span sid='51461' title='51461'>He bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.</span>
<p>
<span sid='51462' title='51462'>And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bohemia&t=h'>Bohemia</a>, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman's wit. </span>
<span sid='51463' title='51463'>He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. </span>
<span sid='51464' title='51464'>And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.</span>
