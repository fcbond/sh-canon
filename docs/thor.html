<h1><span sid='52163' title='52163'>The Problem of Thor Bridge</span></h1>
<p class="subtitle">Arthur Conan Doyle<label for="sn-meta-thor" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-meta-thor" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><!--googleoff: all--><b>Story Number</b>: 50<br><b>Published in</b>: The Strand Magazine (UK)<br><b>Collected in</b>: The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes<!--googleon: all--></span></p>
<p>
<span sid='52164' title='52164'>Somewhere in the vaults of the bank of Cox and Co., at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Charing Cross&t=h'>Charing Cross</a>, there is a travel-worn and battered tin dispatch-box with my name, John H. Watson, MD, Late Indian Army, painted upon the lid. </span>
<span sid='52165' title='52165'>It is crammed with papers, nearly all of which are records of cases to illustrate the curious problems which Mr Sherlock Holmes had at various times to examine. </span>
<span sid='52166' title='52166'>Some, and not the least interesting, were complete failures, and as such will hardly bear narrating, since no final explanation is forthcoming. </span>
<span sid='52167' title='52167'>A problem without a solution may interest the student, but can hardly fail to annoy the casual reader. </span>
<span sid='52168' title='52168'>Among these unfinished tales is that of Mr James Phillimore, who, stepping back into his own house to get his umbrella, was never more seen in this world. </span>
<span sid='52169' title='52169'>No less remarkable is that of the cutter Alicia which sailed one spring morning into a small patch of mist from where she never again emerged, nor was anything further ever heard of herself and her crew. </span>
<span sid='52170' title='52170'>A third case worthy of note is that of Isadora Persano, the wellknown journalist and duellist, who was found stark staring mad with a matchbox in front of him which contained a remarkable worm, said to be unknown to science. </span>
<span sid='52171' title='52171'>Apart from these unfathomed cases, there are some which involve the secrets of private families to an extent which would mean consternation in many exalted quarters if it were thought possible that they might find their way into print. </span>
<span sid='52172' title='52172'>I need not say that such a breach of confidence is unthinkable, and that these records will be separated and destroyed now that my friend has time to turn his energies to the matter. </span>
<span sid='52173' title='52173'>There remain a considerable residue of cases of greater or less interest which I might have edited before had I not feared to give the public a surfeit which might react upon the reputation of the man whom above all others I revere. </span>
<span sid='52174' title='52174'>In some I was myself concerned and can speak as an eye-witness, while in others I was either not present or played so small a part that they could only be told as by a third person. </span>
<span sid='52175' title='52175'>The following narrative is drawn from my own experience.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52176' title='52176'>It was a wild morning in October, and I observed as I was dressing how the last remaining leaves were being whirled from the solitary plane tree which graces the yard behind our house. </span>
<span sid='52177' title='52177'>I descended to breakfast prepared to find my companion in depressed spirits, for, like all great artists, he was easily impressed by his surroundings. </span>
<span sid='52178' title='52178'>On the contrary, I found that he had nearly finished his meal, and that his mood was particularly bright and joyous, with that somewhat sinister cheerfulness which was characteristic of his lighter moments.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52179' title='52179'>'You have a case, Holmes?' I remarked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52180' title='52180'>'The faculty of deduction is certainly contagious, Watson,' he answered. </span>
<span sid='52181' title='52181'>'It has enabled you to probe my secret. </span>
<span sid='52182' title='52182'>Yes, I have a case. </span>
<span sid='52183' title='52183'>After a month of trivialities and stagnation the wheels move once more.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52184' title='52184'>'Might I share it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52185' title='52185'>'There is little to share, but we may discuss it when you have consumed the two hard-boiled eggs with which our new cook has favoured us. </span>
<span sid='52186' title='52186'>Their condition may not be unconnected with the copy of the Family Herald which I observed yesterday upon the hall-table. </span>
<span sid='52187' title='52187'>Even so trivial a matter as cooking an egg demands an attention which is conscious of the passage of time, and incompatible with the love romance in that excellent periodical.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52188' title='52188'>A quarter of an hour later the table had been cleared and we were face to face. </span>
<span sid='52189' title='52189'>He had drawn a letter from his pocket.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52190' title='52190'>'You have heard of Neil Gibson, the Gold King?' he said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52191' title='52191'>'You mean the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n Senator?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52192' title='52192'>'Well, he was once Senator for some Western state, but is better known as the greatest gold-mining magnate in the world.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52193' title='52193'>'Yes, I know of him. </span>
<span sid='52194' title='52194'>He has surely lived in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> for some time. </span>
<span sid='52195' title='52195'>His name is very familiar.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52196' title='52196'>'Yes, he bought a considerable estate in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Hampshire&t=h'>Hampshire</a> some five years ago. </span>
<span sid='52197' title='52197'>Possibly you have already heard of the tragic end of his wife?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52198' title='52198'>'Of course. </span>
<span sid='52199' title='52199'>I remember it now. </span>
<span sid='52200' title='52200'>That is why the name is familiar. </span>
<span sid='52201' title='52201'>But I really know nothing of the details.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52202' title='52202'>Holmes waved his hand towards some papers on a chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52203' title='52203'>'I had no idea that the case was coming my way or I should have had my extracts ready,' said he. </span>
<span sid='52204' title='52204'>'The fact is that the problem, though exceedingly sensational, appeared to present no difficulty. </span>
<span sid='52205' title='52205'>The interesting personality of the accused does not obscure the clearness of the evidence. </span>
<span sid='52206' title='52206'>That was the view taken by the coroner's jury and also in the police-court proceedings. </span>
<span sid='52207' title='52207'>It is now referred to the Assizes at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Winchester&t=h'>Winchester</a>. </span>
<span sid='52208' title='52208'>I fear it is a thankless business. </span>
<span sid='52209' title='52209'>I can discover facts, Watson, but I cannot change them. </span>
<span sid='52210' title='52210'>Unless some entirely new and unexpected ones come to light I do not see what my client can hope for.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52211' title='52211'>'Your client?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52212' title='52212'>'Ah, I forgot I had not told you. </span>
<span sid='52213' title='52213'>I am getting into your involved habit, Watson, of telling a story backwards. </span>
<span sid='52214' title='52214'>You had best read this first.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52215' title='52215'>The letter which he handed to me, written in a bold, masterful hand, ran as follows:</span>
<p>
<span sid='52216' title='52216'>CLARIDGE'S HOTEL, October 3rd. </span>
<span sid='52217' title='52217'>DEAR MR SHERLOCK HOLMES, </span>
<span sid='52218' title='52218'>I can't see the best woman God ever made go to her death without doing all that is possible to save her. </span>
<span sid='52219' title='52219'>I can't explain things - I can't even try to explain them, but I know beyond all doubt that Miss Dunbar is innocent. </span>
<span sid='52220' title='52220'>You know the facts - who doesn't? </span>
<span sid='52221' title='52221'>It has been the gossip of the country. </span>
<span sid='52222' title='52222'>And never a voice raised for her! </span>
<span sid='52223' title='52223'>It's the damned injustice of it all that makes me crazy. </span>
<span sid='52224' title='52224'>That woman has a heart that wouldn't let her kill a fly. </span>
<span sid='52225' title='52225'>Well, I'll come at eleven to-morrow and see if you can get some ray of light in the dark. </span>
<span sid='52226' title='52226'>Maybe I have a clue and don't know it. </span>
<span sid='52227' title='52227'>Anyhow, all I know and all I have and all I am are for your use if only you can save her. </span>
<span sid='52228' title='52228'>If ever in your life you showed your powers, put them now into this case. </span>
<span sid='52229' title='52229'>Yours faithfully, </span>
<span sid='52230' title='52230'>J. NEIL GIBSON</span>
<p>
<span sid='52231' title='52231'>'There you have it,' said Sherlock Holmes, knocking out the ashes of his after-breakfast pipe and slowly refilling it. </span>
<span sid='52232' title='52232'>'That is the gentleman I await. </span>
<span sid='52233' title='52233'>As to the story, you have hardly time to master all these papers, so I must give it to you in a nutshell if you are to take an intellectual interest in the proceedings. </span>
<span sid='52234' title='52234'>This man is the greatest financial power in the world, and a man, as I understand, of most violent and formidable character. </span>
<span sid='52235' title='52235'>He married a wife, the victim of this tragedy, of whom I know nothing save that she was past her prime, which was the more unfortunate as a very attractive governess superintended the education of two young children. </span>
<span sid='52236' title='52236'>These are the three people concerned, and the scene is a grand old manor-house, the centre of an historical English estate. </span>
<span sid='52237' title='52237'>Then as to the tragedy. </span>
<span sid='52238' title='52238'>The wife was found in the grounds nearly half a mile from the house, late at night, clad in her dinner dress, with a shawl over her shoulders and a revolver bullet through her brain. </span>
<span sid='52239' title='52239'>No weapon was found near her and there was no local clue as to the murder. </span>
<span sid='52240' title='52240'>No weapon near her, Watson - mark that! </span>
<span sid='52241' title='52241'>The crime seems to have been committed late in the evening, and the body was found by a gamekeeper about eleven o'clock, when it was examined by the police and by a doctor before being carried up to the house. </span>
<span sid='52242' title='52242'>Is this too condensed, or can you follow it clearly?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52243' title='52243'>'It is all very clear. </span>
<span sid='52244' title='52244'>But why suspect the governess?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52245' title='52245'>'Well, in the first place there is some very direct evidence. </span>
<span sid='52246' title='52246'>A revolver with one discharged chamber and a calibre which corresponded with the bullet was found on the floor of her wardrobe.' </span>
<span sid='52247' title='52247'>His eyes fixed and he repeated in broken words, 'On-the-floor-of-her-wardrobe.' </span>
<span sid='52248' title='52248'>Then he sank into silence, and I saw that some train of thought had been set moving which I should be foolish to interrupt. </span>
<span sid='52249' title='52249'>Suddenly with a start he emerged into brisk life once more. </span>
<span sid='52250' title='52250'>'Yes, Watson, it was found. </span>
<span sid='52251' title='52251'>Pretty damning, eh? </span>
<span sid='52252' title='52252'>So the two juries thought. </span>
<span sid='52253' title='52253'>Then the dead woman had a note upon her making an appointment at that very place and signed by the governess. </span>
<span sid='52254' title='52254'>How's that? </span>
<span sid='52255' title='52255'>Finally, there is the motive. </span>
<span sid='52256' title='52256'>Senator Gibson is an attractive person. </span>
<span sid='52257' title='52257'>If his wife dies, who more likely to succeed her than the young lady who had already by all accounts received pressing attentions from her employer. </span>
<span sid='52258' title='52258'>Love, fortune, power, all depending upon one middle-aged life. </span>
<span sid='52259' title='52259'>Ugly, Watson - very ugly!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52260' title='52260'>'Yes, indeed, Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52261' title='52261'>'Nor could she prove an alibi. </span>
<span sid='52262' title='52262'>On the contrary, she had to admit that she was down near Thor Bridge - that was the scene of the tragedy - about that hour. </span>
<span sid='52263' title='52263'>She couldn't deny it, for some passing villager had seen her there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52264' title='52264'>'That really seems final.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52265' title='52265'>'And yet, Watson - and yet! </span>
<span sid='52266' title='52266'>This bridge - a single broad span of stone with balustraded sides - carries the drive over the narrowest part of a long, deep, reed-girt sheet of water. </span>
<span sid='52267' title='52267'>Thor Mere it is called. </span>
<span sid='52268' title='52268'>In the mouth of the bridge lay the dead woman. </span>
<span sid='52269' title='52269'>Such are the main facts. </span>
<span sid='52270' title='52270'>But here, if I mistake not, is our client, considerably before his time.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52271' title='52271'>Billy had opened the door, but the name he announced was an unexpected one. </span>
<span sid='52272' title='52272'>Mr Marlow Bates was a stranger to both of us. </span>
<span sid='52273' title='52273'>He was a thin, nervous wisp of a man with frightened eyes, and a twitching, hesitating manner - a man whom my own professional eye would judge to be on the brink of an absolute nervous breakdown.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52274' title='52274'>'You seem agitated, Mr Bates,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='52275' title='52275'>'Pray sit down. </span>
<span sid='52276' title='52276'>I fear I can only give you a short time, for I have an appointment at eleven.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52277' title='52277'>'I know you have,' our visitor gasped, shooting out short sentences like a man who is out of breath. </span>
<span sid='52278' title='52278'>'Mr Gibson is coming. </span>
<span sid='52279' title='52279'>Mr Gibson is my employer. </span>
<span sid='52280' title='52280'>I am manager of his estate. </span>
<span sid='52281' title='52281'>Mr Holmes, he is a villain - an infernal villain.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52282' title='52282'>'Strong language, Mr Bates.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52283' title='52283'>'I have to be emphatic, Mr Holmes, for the time is so limited. </span>
<span sid='52284' title='52284'>I would not have him find me here for the world. </span>
<span sid='52285' title='52285'>He is almost due now. </span>
<span sid='52286' title='52286'>But I was so situated that I could not come earlier. </span>
<span sid='52287' title='52287'>His secretary, Mr Ferguson, only told me this morning of his appointment with you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52288' title='52288'>'And you are his manager?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52289' title='52289'>'I have given him notice. </span>
<span sid='52290' title='52290'>In a couple of weeks I shall have shaken off his accursed slavery. </span>
<span sid='52291' title='52291'>A hard man, Mr Holmes, hard to all about him. </span>
<span sid='52292' title='52292'>Those public charities are a screen to cover his private iniquities. </span>
<span sid='52293' title='52293'>But his wife was his chief victim. </span>
<span sid='52294' title='52294'>He was brutal to her - yes, sir, brutal! </span>
<span sid='52295' title='52295'>How she came by her death I do not know, but I am sure that he had made her life a misery to her. </span>
<span sid='52296' title='52296'>She was a creature of the Tropics, a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brazil&t=h'>Brazil</a>ian by birth, as no doubt you know?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52297' title='52297'>'No, it had escaped me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52298' title='52298'>'Tropical by birth and tropical by nature. </span>
<span sid='52299' title='52299'>A child of the sun and of passion. </span>
<span sid='52300' title='52300'>She had loved him as such women can love, but when her own physical charms had faded - I am told that they once were great - there was nothing to hold him. </span>
<span sid='52301' title='52301'>We all liked her and felt for her and hated him for the way that he treated her. </span>
<span sid='52302' title='52302'>But he is plausible and cunning. </span>
<span sid='52303' title='52303'>That is all I have to say to you. </span>
<span sid='52304' title='52304'>Don't take him at his face value. </span>
<span sid='52305' title='52305'>There is more behind. </span>
<span sid='52306' title='52306'>Now I'll go. </span>
<span sid='52307' title='52307'>No, no, don't detain me! </span>
<span sid='52308' title='52308'>He is almost due.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52309' title='52309'>With a frightened look at the clock our strange visitor literally ran to the door and disappeared.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52310' title='52310'>'Well! well!' said Holmes, after an interval of silence. </span>
<span sid='52311' title='52311'>'Mr Gibson seems to have a nice loyal household. </span>
<span sid='52312' title='52312'>But the warning is a useful one, and now we can only wait till the man himself appears.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52313' title='52313'>Sharp at the hour we heard a heavy step upon the stairs and the famous millionaire was shown into the room. </span>
<span sid='52314' title='52314'>As I looked upon him I understood not only the fears and dislike of his manager, but also the execrations which so many business rivals have heaped upon his head. </span>
<span sid='52315' title='52315'>If I were a sculptor and desired to idealize the successful man of affairs, iron of nerve and leathery of conscience, I should choose Mr Neil Gibson as my model. </span>
<span sid='52316' title='52316'>His tall, gaunt, craggy figure had a suggestion of hunger and rapacity. </span>
<span sid='52317' title='52317'>An Abraham Lincoln keyed to base uses instead of high ones would give some idea of the man. </span>
<span sid='52318' title='52318'>His face might have been chiselled in granite, hard-set, craggy, remorseless, with deep lines upon it, the scars of many a crisis. </span>
<span sid='52319' title='52319'>Cold grey eyes, looking shrewdly out from under bristling brows, surveyed us each in turn. </span>
<span sid='52320' title='52320'>He bowed in perfunctory fashion as Holmes mentioned my name, and then with a masterful air of possession he drew a chair up to my companion and seated himself with his bony knees almost touching him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52321' title='52321'>'Let me say right here, Mr Holmes,' he began, 'that money is nothing to me in this case. </span>
<span sid='52322' title='52322'>You can burn it if it's any use in lighting you to the truth. </span>
<span sid='52323' title='52323'>This woman is innocent and this woman has to be cleared, and it's up to you to do it. </span>
<span sid='52324' title='52324'>Name your figure!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52325' title='52325'>'My professional charges are upon a fixed scale,' said Holmes coldly. </span>
<span sid='52326' title='52326'>'I do not vary them, save when I remit them altogether.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52327' title='52327'>'Well, if dollars make no difference to you, think of the reputation. </span>
<span sid='52328' title='52328'>If you pull this off every paper in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> and <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a> will be booming you. </span>
<span sid='52329' title='52329'>You'll be the talk of two continents.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52330' title='52330'>'Thank you, Mr Gibson, I do not think that I am in need of booming. </span>
<span sid='52331' title='52331'>It may surprise you to know that I prefer to work anonymously, and that it is the problem itself which attracts me. </span>
<span sid='52332' title='52332'>But we are wasting time. </span>
<span sid='52333' title='52333'>Let us get down to the facts.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52334' title='52334'>'I think that you will find all the main ones in the Press reports. </span>
<span sid='52335' title='52335'>I don't know that I can add anything which will help you. </span>
<span sid='52336' title='52336'>But if there is anything you would wish more light upon - well, I am here to give it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52337' title='52337'>'Well, there is just one point.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52338' title='52338'>'What is it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52339' title='52339'>'What were the exact relations between you and Miss Dunbar?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52340' title='52340'>The Gold King gave a violent start, and half rose from his chair. </span>
<span sid='52341' title='52341'>Then his massive calm came back to him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52342' title='52342'>'I suppose you are within your rights - and maybe doing your duty - in asking such a question, Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52343' title='52343'>'We will agree to suppose so,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52344' title='52344'>'Then I can assure you that our relations were entirely and always those of an employer towards a young lady whom he never conversed with, or ever saw, save when she was in the company of his children.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52345' title='52345'>Holmes rose from his chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52346' title='52346'>'I am a rather busy man, Mr Gibson,' said he, 'and I have no time or taste for aimless conversations. </span>
<span sid='52347' title='52347'>I wish you good morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52348' title='52348'>Our visitor had risen also and his great loose figure towered above Holmes. </span>
<span sid='52349' title='52349'>There was an angry gleam from under those bristling brows and a tinge of colour in the sallow cheeks.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52350' title='52350'>'What the devil do you mean by this, Mr Holmes? </span>
<span sid='52351' title='52351'>Do you dismiss my case?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52352' title='52352'>'Well, Mr Gibson, at least I dismiss you. </span>
<span sid='52353' title='52353'>I should have thought my words were plain.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52354' title='52354'>'Plain enough, but what's at the back of it? </span>
<span sid='52355' title='52355'>Raising the price on me, or afraid to tackle it, or what? </span>
<span sid='52356' title='52356'>I've a right to a plain answer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52357' title='52357'>'Well, perhaps you have,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='52358' title='52358'>'I'll give you one. </span>
<span sid='52359' title='52359'>This case is quite sufficiently complicated to start with, without the further difficulty of false information.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52360' title='52360'>'Meaning that I lie.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52361' title='52361'>'Well, I was trying to express it as delicately as I could, but if you insist upon the word I will not contradict you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52362' title='52362'>I sprang to my feet, for the expression upon the millionaire's face was fiendish in its intensity, and he had raised his great knotted fist. </span>
<span sid='52363' title='52363'>Holmes smiled languidly, and reached his hand out for his pipe.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52364' title='52364'>'Don't be noisy, Mr Gibson. </span>
<span sid='52365' title='52365'>I find that after breakfast even the smallest argument is unsettling. </span>
<span sid='52366' title='52366'>I suggest that a stroll in the morning air and a little quiet thought will be greatly to your advantage.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52367' title='52367'>With an effort the Gold King mastered his fury. </span>
<span sid='52368' title='52368'>I could not but admire him, for by a supreme self-command he had turned in a minute from a hot flame of anger to a frigid and contemptuous indifference.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52369' title='52369'>'Well, it's your choice. </span>
<span sid='52370' title='52370'>I guess you know how to run your own business. </span>
<span sid='52371' title='52371'>I can't make you touch the case against your will. </span>
<span sid='52372' title='52372'>You've done yourself no good this morning, Mr Holmes, for I have broken stronger men than you. </span>
<span sid='52373' title='52373'>No man ever crossed me and was the better for it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52374' title='52374'>'So many have said so, and yet here I am,' said Holmes, smiling. </span>
<span sid='52375' title='52375'>'Well, good morning, Mr Gibson. </span>
<span sid='52376' title='52376'>You have a good deal yet to learn.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52377' title='52377'>Our visitor made a noisy exit, but Holmes smoked in imperturbable silence with dreamy eyes fixed upon the ceiling.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52378' title='52378'>'Any views, Watson?' he asked at last.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52379' title='52379'>'Well, Holmes, I must confess that when I consider that this is a man who would certainly brush any obstacle from his path, and when I remember that his wife may have been an obstacle and an object of dislike, as that man Bates plainly told us, it seems to me-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52380' title='52380'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='52381' title='52381'>And to me also.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52382' title='52382'>'But what were his relations with the governess, and how did you discover them?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52383' title='52383'>'Bluff, Watson, bluff! </span>
<span sid='52384' title='52384'>When I considered the passionate, unconventional, unbusiness-like tone of his letter, and contrasted it with his self-contained manner and appearance, it was pretty clear that there was some deep emotion which centred upon the accused woman rather than upon the victim. </span>
<span sid='52385' title='52385'>We've got to understand the exact relations of those three people if we are to reach the truth. </span>
<span sid='52386' title='52386'>You saw the frontal attack which I made upon him and how imperturbably he received it. </span>
<span sid='52387' title='52387'>Then I bluffed him by giving him the impression that I was absolutely certain, when in reality I was only extremely suspicious.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52388' title='52388'>'Perhaps he will come back?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52389' title='52389'>'He is sure to come back. </span>
<span sid='52390' title='52390'>He must come back. </span>
<span sid='52391' title='52391'>He can't leave it where it is. </span>
<span sid='52392' title='52392'>Ha! isn't that a ring? </span>
<span sid='52393' title='52393'>Yes, there is his footstep. </span>
<span sid='52394' title='52394'>Well, Mr Gibson, I was just saying to Dr Watson that you were somewhat overdue.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52395' title='52395'>The Gold King had re-entered the room in a more chastened mood than he had left it. </span>
<span sid='52396' title='52396'>His wounded pride still showed in his resentful eyes, but his common sense had shown him that he must yield if he would attain his end.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52397' title='52397'>'I've been thinking it over, Mr Holmes, and I feel that I have been hasty in taking your remarks amiss. </span>
<span sid='52398' title='52398'>You are justified in getting down to the facts, whatever they may be, and I think the more of you for it. </span>
<span sid='52399' title='52399'>I can assure you, however, that the relations between Miss Dunbar and me don't really touch this case.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52400' title='52400'>'That is for me to decide, is it not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52401' title='52401'>'Yes, I guess that is so. </span>
<span sid='52402' title='52402'>You're like a surgeon who wants every symptom before he can give his diagnosis.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52403' title='52403'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='52404' title='52404'>That expresses it. </span>
<span sid='52405' title='52405'>And it is only a patient who has an object in deceiving his surgeon who would conceal the facts of his case.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52406' title='52406'>'That may be so, but you will admit, Mr Holmes, that most men would shy off a bit when they are asked pointblank what their relations with a woman may be - if there is really some serious feeling in the case. </span>
<span sid='52407' title='52407'>I guess most men have a little private reserve of their own in some corner of their souls where they don't welcome intruders. </span>
<span sid='52408' title='52408'>And you burst suddenly into it. </span>
<span sid='52409' title='52409'>But the object excuses you, since it was to try and save her. </span>
<span sid='52410' title='52410'>Well, the stakes are down and the reserve open and you can explore where you will. </span>
<span sid='52411' title='52411'>What is it you want?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52412' title='52412'>'The truth.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52413' title='52413'>The Gold King paused for a moment as one who marshals his thoughts. </span>
<span sid='52414' title='52414'>His grim, deep-lined face had become even sadder and more grave.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52415' title='52415'>'I can give it to you in a very few words, Mr Holmes,' said he at last. </span>
<span sid='52416' title='52416'>'There are some things that are painful as well as difficult to say, so I won't go deeper than is needful. </span>
<span sid='52417' title='52417'>I met my wife when I was gold-hunting in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brazil&t=h'>Brazil</a>. </span>
<span sid='52418' title='52418'>Maria Pinto was the daughter of a Government official at Manaos, and she was very beautiful. </span>
<span sid='52419' title='52419'>I was young and ardent in those days, but even now, as I look back with colder blood and a more critical eye, I can see that she was rare and wonderful in her beauty. </span>
<span sid='52420' title='52420'>It was a deep rich nature, too, passionate, wholehearted, tropical, ill-balanced, very different from the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n women whom I had known. </span>
<span sid='52421' title='52421'>Well, to make a long story short, I loved her and I married her. </span>
<span sid='52422' title='52422'>It was only when the romance had passed - and it lingered for years - that I realized that we had nothing - absolutely nothing - in common. </span>
<span sid='52423' title='52423'>My love faded. </span>
<span sid='52424' title='52424'>If hers had faded also it might have been easier. </span>
<span sid='52425' title='52425'>But you know the wonderful way of women! </span>
<span sid='52426' title='52426'>Do what I might nothing could turn her from me. </span>
<span sid='52427' title='52427'>If I have been harsh to her, even brutal as some have said, it has been because I knew that if I could kill her love, or if it turned to hate, it would be easier for both of us. </span>
<span sid='52428' title='52428'>But nothing changed her. </span>
<span sid='52429' title='52429'>She adored me in those English woods as she had adored me twenty years ago on the banks of the Amazon. </span>
<span sid='52430' title='52430'>Do what I might, she was devoted as ever.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52431' title='52431'>'Then came Miss Grace Dunbar. </span>
<span sid='52432' title='52432'>She answered our advertisement and became governess to our two children. </span>
<span sid='52433' title='52433'>Perhaps you have seen her portrait in the papers. </span>
<span sid='52434' title='52434'>The whole world has proclaimed that she also is a very beautiful woman. </span>
<span sid='52435' title='52435'>Now, I make no pretence to be more moral than my neighbours, and I will admit to you that I could not live under the same roof with such a woman and in daily contact with her without feeling a passionate regard for her. </span>
<span sid='52436' title='52436'>Do you blame me, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52437' title='52437'>'I do not blame you for feeling it. </span>
<span sid='52438' title='52438'>I should blame you if you expressed it, since this young lady was in a sense under your protection.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52439' title='52439'>'Well, maybe so,' said the millionaire, though for a moment the reproof had brought the old angry gleam into his eyes. </span>
<span sid='52440' title='52440'>'I'm not pretending to be any better than I am. </span>
<span sid='52441' title='52441'>I guess all my life I've been a man that reached out his hand for what he wanted, and I never wanted anything more than the love and possession of that woman. </span>
<span sid='52442' title='52442'>I told her so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52443' title='52443'>'Oh, you did, did you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52444' title='52444'>Holmes could look very formidable when he was moved.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52445' title='52445'>'I said to her that if I could marry her I would, but that it was out of my power. </span>
<span sid='52446' title='52446'>I said that money was no object and that all I could do to make her happy and comfortable would be done.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52447' title='52447'>'Very generous, I am sure,' said Holmes, with a sneer.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52448' title='52448'>'See here, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='52449' title='52449'>I came to you on a question of evidence, not on a question of morals. </span>
<span sid='52450' title='52450'>I'm not asking for your criticism.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52451' title='52451'>'It is only for the young lady's sake that I touch your case at all,' said Holmes, sternly. </span>
<span sid='52452' title='52452'>'I don't know that anything she is accused of is really worse than what you have yourself admitted, that you have tried to ruin a defenceless girl who was under your roof. </span>
<span sid='52453' title='52453'>Some of you rich men have to be taught that all the world cannot be bribed into condoning your offences.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52454' title='52454'>To my surprise the Gold King took the reproof with equanimity.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52455' title='52455'>'That's how I feel myself about it now. </span>
<span sid='52456' title='52456'>I thank God that my plans did not work out as I intended. </span>
<span sid='52457' title='52457'>She would have none of it, and she wanted to leave the house instantly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52458' title='52458'>'Why did she not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52459' title='52459'>'Well, in the first place, others were dependent upon her, and it was no light matter for her to let them all down by sacrificing her living. </span>
<span sid='52460' title='52460'>When I had sworn - as I did - that she should never be molested again, she consented to remain. </span>
<span sid='52461' title='52461'>But there was another reason. </span>
<span sid='52462' title='52462'>She knew the influence she had over me, and that it was stronger than any other influence in the world. </span>
<span sid='52463' title='52463'>She wanted to use it for good.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52464' title='52464'>'How?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52465' title='52465'>'Well, she knew something of my affairs. </span>
<span sid='52466' title='52466'>They are large, Mr Holmes - large beyond the belief of an ordinary man. </span>
<span sid='52467' title='52467'>I can make or break - and it is usually break. </span>
<span sid='52468' title='52468'>It wasn't individuals only. </span>
<span sid='52469' title='52469'>It was communities, cities, even nations. </span>
<span sid='52470' title='52470'>Business is a hard game, and the weak go to the wall. </span>
<span sid='52471' title='52471'>I played the game for all it was worth. </span>
<span sid='52472' title='52472'>I never squealed myself and I never cared if the other fellow squealed. </span>
<span sid='52473' title='52473'>But she saw it different. </span>
<span sid='52474' title='52474'>I guess she was right. </span>
<span sid='52475' title='52475'>She believed and said that a fortune for one man that was more than he needed should not be built on ten thousand ruined men who were left without the means of life. </span>
<span sid='52476' title='52476'>That was how she saw it, and I guess she could see past the dollars to something that was more lasting. </span>
<span sid='52477' title='52477'>She found that I listened to what she said, and she believed she was serving the world by influencing my actions. </span>
<span sid='52478' title='52478'>So she stayed - and then this came along.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52479' title='52479'>'Can you throw any light upon that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52480' title='52480'>The Gold King paused for a minute or more, his head sunk in his hands, lost in deep thought.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52481' title='52481'>'It's very black against her. </span>
<span sid='52482' title='52482'>I can't deny that. </span>
<span sid='52483' title='52483'>And women lead an inward life and may do things beyond the judgement of a man. </span>
<span sid='52484' title='52484'>At first I was so rattled and taken aback that I was ready to think she had been led away in some extraordinary fashion that was clean against her usual nature. </span>
<span sid='52485' title='52485'>One explanation came into my head. </span>
<span sid='52486' title='52486'>I give it to you, Mr Holmes, for what it is worth. </span>
<span sid='52487' title='52487'>There is no doubt that my wife was bitterly jealous. </span>
<span sid='52488' title='52488'>There is a soul-jealousy that can be as frantic as any body-jealousy, and though my wife had no cause - and I think she understood this - for the latter, she was aware that this English girl exerted an influence upon my mind and my acts that she herself never had. </span>
<span sid='52489' title='52489'>It was an influence for good, but that did not mend the matter. </span>
<span sid='52490' title='52490'>She was crazy with hatred, and the heat of the Amazon was always in her blood. </span>
<span sid='52491' title='52491'>She might have planned to murder Miss Dunbar - or we will say to threaten her with a gun and so frighten her into leaving us. </span>
<span sid='52492' title='52492'>Then there might have been a scuffle and the gun gone off and shot the woman who held it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52493' title='52493'>'That possibility had already occurred to me,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52494' title='52494'>'Indeed, it is the only obvious alternative to deliberate murder.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52495' title='52495'>'But she utterly denies it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52496' title='52496'>'Well, that is not final - is it? </span>
<span sid='52497' title='52497'>One can understand that a woman placed in so awful a position might hurry home still in her bewilderment holding the revolver. </span>
<span sid='52498' title='52498'>She might even throw it down among her clothes, hardly knowing what she was doing, and when it was found she might try to lie her way out by a total denial, since all explanation was impossible. </span>
<span sid='52499' title='52499'>What is against such a supposition?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52500' title='52500'>'Miss Dunbar herself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52501' title='52501'>'Well, perhaps.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52502' title='52502'>Holmes looked at his watch. </span>
<span sid='52503' title='52503'>'I have no doubt we can get the necessary permits this morning and reach <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Winchester&t=h'>Winchester</a> by the evening train. </span>
<span sid='52504' title='52504'>When I have seen this young lady, it is very possible that I may be of more use to you in the matter, though I cannot promise that my conclusions will necessarily be such as you desire.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52505' title='52505'>There was some delay in the official pass, and instead of reaching <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Winchester&t=h'>Winchester</a> that day we went down to Thor Place, the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Hampshire&t=h'>Hampshire</a> estate of Mr Neil Gibson. </span>
<span sid='52506' title='52506'>He did not accompany us himself, but we had the address of Sergeant <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Coventry&t=h'>Coventry</a>, of the local police, who had first examined into the affair. </span>
<span sid='52507' title='52507'>He was a tall, thin, cadaverous man, with a secretive and mysterious manner, which conveyed the idea that he knew or suspected a very great deal more than he dared to say. </span>
<span sid='52508' title='52508'>He had a trick, too, of suddenly sinking his voice to a whisper as if he had come upon something of vital importance, though the information was usually commonplace enough. </span>
<span sid='52509' title='52509'>Behind these tricks of manner he soon showed himself to be a decent, honest fellow who was not too proud to admit that he was out of his depth and would welcome any help.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52510' title='52510'>'Anyhow, I'd rather have you than <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>, Mr Holmes,' said he. </span>
<span sid='52511' title='52511'>'If the Yard gets called into a case, then the local loses all credit for success and may be blamed for failure. </span>
<span sid='52512' title='52512'>Now, you play straight, so I've heard.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52513' title='52513'>'I need not appear in the matter at all,' said Holmes, to the evident relief of our melancholy acquaintance. </span>
<span sid='52514' title='52514'>'If I can clear it up I don't ask to have my name mentioned.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52515' title='52515'>'Well, it's very handsome of you, I am sure. </span>
<span sid='52516' title='52516'>And your friend, Dr Watson, can be trusted, I know. </span>
<span sid='52517' title='52517'>Now, Mr Holmes, as we walk down to the place there is one question I should like to ask you. </span>
<span sid='52518' title='52518'>I'd breathe it to no soul but you.' </span>
<span sid='52519' title='52519'>He looked round as though he hardly dare utter the words. </span>
<span sid='52520' title='52520'>'Don't you think there might be a case against Mr Neil Gibson himself?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52521' title='52521'>'I have been considering that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52522' title='52522'>'You've not seen Miss Dunbar. </span>
<span sid='52523' title='52523'>She is a wonderful fine woman in every way. </span>
<span sid='52524' title='52524'>He may well have wished his wife out of the road. </span>
<span sid='52525' title='52525'>And these <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>ns are readier with pistols than our folk are. </span>
<span sid='52526' title='52526'>It was his pistol, you know.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52527' title='52527'>'Was that clearly made out?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52528' title='52528'>'Yes, sir. </span>
<span sid='52529' title='52529'>It was one of a pair that he had.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52530' title='52530'>'One of a pair? </span>
<span sid='52531' title='52531'>Where is the other?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52532' title='52532'>'Well, the gentleman has a lot of fire-arms of one sort and another. </span>
<span sid='52533' title='52533'>We never quite matched that particular pistol - but the box was made for two.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52534' title='52534'>'If it was one of a pair you should surely be able to match it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52535' title='52535'>'Well, we have them all laid out at the house if you would care to look them over.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52536' title='52536'>'Later, perhaps. </span>
<span sid='52537' title='52537'>I think we will walk down together and have a look at the scene of the tragedy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52538' title='52538'>The conversation had taken place in the little front room of Sergeant <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Coventry&t=h'>Coventry</a>'s humble cottage, which served as the local police station. </span>
<span sid='52539' title='52539'>A walk of half a mile or so across a wind-swept heath, all gold and bronze with the fading ferns, brought us to a side-gate opening into the grounds of the Thor Place estate. </span>
<span sid='52540' title='52540'>A path led us through the pheasant preserves, and then from a clearing we saw the widespread, half-timbered house, half Tudor and half <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Georgia&t=h'>Georgia</a>n, upon the crest of the hill. </span>
<span sid='52541' title='52541'>Beside us there was a long, reedy pool, constricted in the centre where the main carriage drive passed over a stone bridge, but swelling into small lakes on either side. </span>
<span sid='52542' title='52542'>Our guide paused at the mouth of this bridge, and he pointed to the ground.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52543' title='52543'>'That was where Mrs Gibson's body lay. </span>
<span sid='52544' title='52544'>I marked it by that stone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52545' title='52545'>'I understand that you were there before it was moved?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52546' title='52546'>'Yes, they sent for me at once.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52547' title='52547'>'Who did?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52548' title='52548'>'Mr Gibson himself. </span>
<span sid='52549' title='52549'>The moment the alarm was given and he had rushed down with others from the house, he insisted that nothing should be moved until the police should arrive.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52550' title='52550'>'That was sensible. </span>
<span sid='52551' title='52551'>I gathered from the newspaper report that the shot was fired from close quarters.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52552' title='52552'>'Yes, sir, very close.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52553' title='52553'>'Near the right temple?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52554' title='52554'>'Just behind it, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52555' title='52555'>'How did the body lie?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52556' title='52556'>'On the back, sir. </span>
<span sid='52557' title='52557'>No trace of a struggle. </span>
<span sid='52558' title='52558'>No marks. </span>
<span sid='52559' title='52559'>No weapon. </span>
<span sid='52560' title='52560'>The short note from Miss Dunbar was clutched in her left hand.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52561' title='52561'>'Clutched, you say?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52562' title='52562'>'Yes, sir, we could hardly open the fingers.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52563' title='52563'>'That is of great importance. </span>
<span sid='52564' title='52564'>It excludes the idea that anyone could have placed the note there after death in order to furnish a false clue. </span>
<span sid='52565' title='52565'>Dear me! </span>
<span sid='52566' title='52566'>The note, as I remember, was quite short. </span>
<span sid='52567' title='52567'>"I will be at Thor Bridge at nine o'clock. </span>
<span sid='52568' title='52568'>- G. Dunbar." </span>
<span sid='52569' title='52569'>Was that not so?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52570' title='52570'>'Yes, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52571' title='52571'>'Did Miss Dunbar admit writing it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52572' title='52572'>'Yes, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52573' title='52573'>'What was her explanation?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52574' title='52574'>'Her defence was reserved for the Assizes. </span>
<span sid='52575' title='52575'>She would say nothing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52576' title='52576'>'The problem is certainly a very interesting one. </span>
<span sid='52577' title='52577'>The point of the letter is very obscure, is it not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52578' title='52578'>'Well, sir,' said the guide, 'it seemed, if I may be so bold as to say so, the only really clear point in the whole case.' </span>
<span sid='52579' title='52579'>Holmes shook his head.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52580' title='52580'>'Granting that the letter is genuine and was really written, it was certainly received some time before - say one hour or two. </span>
<span sid='52581' title='52581'>Why, then, was this lady still clasping it in her left hand? </span>
<span sid='52582' title='52582'>Why should she carry it so carefully? </span>
<span sid='52583' title='52583'>She did not need to refer to it in the interview. </span>
<span sid='52584' title='52584'>Does it not seem remarkable?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52585' title='52585'>'Well, sir, as you put it, perhaps it does.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52586' title='52586'>'I think I should like to sit quietly for a few minutes and think it out.' </span>
<span sid='52587' title='52587'>He seated himself upon the stone ledge of the bridge, and I could see his quick grey eyes darting their questioning glances in every direction. </span>
<span sid='52588' title='52588'>Suddenly he sprang up again and ran across to the opposite parapet, whipped his lens from his pocket, and began to examine the stonework.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52589' title='52589'>'This is curious,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52590' title='52590'>'Yes, sir, we saw the chip on the ledge. </span>
<span sid='52591' title='52591'>I expect it's been done by some passer-by.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52592' title='52592'>The stonework was grey, but at this one point it showed white for a space not larger than a sixpence. </span>
<span sid='52593' title='52593'>When examined closely one could see that the surface was chipped as by a sharp blow.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52594' title='52594'>'It took some violence to do that,' said Holmes thoughtfully. </span>
<span sid='52595' title='52595'>With his cane he struck the ledge several times without leaving a mark. </span>
<span sid='52596' title='52596'>'Yes, it was a hard knock. </span>
<span sid='52597' title='52597'>In a curious place, too. </span>
<span sid='52598' title='52598'>It was not from above but from below, for you see that it is on the lower edge of the parapet.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52599' title='52599'>'But it is at least fifteen feet from the body.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52600' title='52600'>'Yes, it is fifteen feet from the body. </span>
<span sid='52601' title='52601'>It may have nothing to do with the matter, but it is a point worth nothing. </span>
<span sid='52602' title='52602'>I do not think we have anything more to learn here. </span>
<span sid='52603' title='52603'>There were no footsteps, you say?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52604' title='52604'>'The ground was iron hard, sir. </span>
<span sid='52605' title='52605'>There were no traces at all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52606' title='52606'>'Then we can go. </span>
<span sid='52607' title='52607'>We will go up to the house first and look over these weapons of which you speak. </span>
<span sid='52608' title='52608'>Then we shall get on to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Winchester&t=h'>Winchester</a>, for I should desire to see Miss Dunbar before we go farther.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52609' title='52609'>Mr Neil Gibson had not returned from town, but we saw in the house the neurotic Mr Bates who had called upon us in the morning. </span>
<span sid='52610' title='52610'>He showed us with a sinister relish the formidable array of fire-arms of various shapes and sizes which his employer had accumulated in the course of an adventurous life.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52611' title='52611'>'Mr Gibson has his enemies, as anyone would expect who knew him and his methods,' said he. </span>
<span sid='52612' title='52612'>'He sleeps with a loaded revolver in the drawer beside his bed. </span>
<span sid='52613' title='52613'>He is a man of violence, sir, and there are times when all of us are afraid of him. </span>
<span sid='52614' title='52614'>I am sure that the poor lady who has passed was often terrified.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52615' title='52615'>'Did you ever witness physical violence towards her?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52616' title='52616'>'No, I cannot say that. </span>
<span sid='52617' title='52617'>But I have heard words which were nearly as bad - words of cold, cutting contempt, even before the servants.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52618' title='52618'>'Our millionaire does not seem to shine in private life,' remarked Holmes, as we made our way to the station. </span>
<span sid='52619' title='52619'>'Well, Watson, we have come on a good many facts, some of them new ones, and yet I seem some way from my conclusion. </span>
<span sid='52620' title='52620'>In spite of the very evident dislike which Mr Bates has to his employer, I gather from him that when the alarm came he was undoubtedly in his library. </span>
<span sid='52621' title='52621'>Dinner was over at eight-thirty and all was normal up to then. </span>
<span sid='52622' title='52622'>It is true that the alarm was somewhat late in the evening, but the tragedy certainly occurred about the hour named in the note. </span>
<span sid='52623' title='52623'>There is no evidence at all that Mr Gibson had been out of doors since his return from town at five o'clock. </span>
<span sid='52624' title='52624'>On the other hand, Miss Dunbar, as I understand it, admits that she had made an appointment to meet Mrs Gibson at the bridge. </span>
<span sid='52625' title='52625'>Beyond this she would say nothing, as her lawyer had advised her to reserve her defence. </span>
<span sid='52626' title='52626'>We have several very vital questions to ask that young lady, and my mind will not be easy until we have seen her. </span>
<span sid='52627' title='52627'>I must confess that the case would seem to me to be very black against her if it were not for one thing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52628' title='52628'>'And what is that, Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52629' title='52629'>'The finding of the pistol in her wardrobe.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52630' title='52630'>'Dear me, Holmes!' I cried, 'that seemed to me to be the most damning incident of all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52631' title='52631'>'Not so, Watson. </span>
<span sid='52632' title='52632'>It had struck me even at my first perfunctory reading as very strange, and now that I am in closer touch with the case it is my only firm ground for hope. </span>
<span sid='52633' title='52633'>We must look for consistency. </span>
<span sid='52634' title='52634'>Where there is a want of it we must suspect deception.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52635' title='52635'>'I hardly follow you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52636' title='52636'>'Well, now, Watson, suppose for a moment that we visualize you in the character of a woman who, in a cold, premeditated fashion, is about to get rid of a rival. </span>
<span sid='52637' title='52637'>You have planned it. </span>
<span sid='52638' title='52638'>A note has been written. </span>
<span sid='52639' title='52639'>The victim has come. </span>
<span sid='52640' title='52640'>You have your weapon. </span>
<span sid='52641' title='52641'>The crime is done. </span>
<span sid='52642' title='52642'>It has been workmanlike and complete. </span>
<span sid='52643' title='52643'>Do you tell me that after carrying out so crafty a crime you would now ruin your reputation as a criminal by forgetting to fling your weapon into those adjacent reed-beds which would for ever cover it, but you must needs carry it carefully home and put it in your own wardrobe, the very first place that would be searched? </span>
<span sid='52644' title='52644'>Your best friends would hardly call you a schemer, Watson, and yet I could not picture you doing anything so crude as that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52645' title='52645'>'In the excitement of the moment-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52646' title='52646'>'No, no, Watson, I will not admit that it is possible. </span>
<span sid='52647' title='52647'>Where a crime is coolly premeditated, then the means of covering it are coolly premeditated also. </span>
<span sid='52648' title='52648'>I hope, therefore, that we are in the presence of a serious misconception.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52649' title='52649'>'But there is so much to explain.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52650' title='52650'>'Well, we shall set about explaining it. </span>
<span sid='52651' title='52651'>When once your point of view is changed, the very thing which was so damning becomes a clue to the truth. </span>
<span sid='52652' title='52652'>For example, there is the revolver. </span>
<span sid='52653' title='52653'>Miss Dunbar disclaims all knowledge of it. </span>
<span sid='52654' title='52654'>On our new theory she is speaking truth when she says so. </span>
<span sid='52655' title='52655'>Therefore, it was placed in her wardrobe. </span>
<span sid='52656' title='52656'>Who placed it there? </span>
<span sid='52657' title='52657'>Someone who wished to incriminate her. </span>
<span sid='52658' title='52658'>Was not that person the actual criminal? </span>
<span sid='52659' title='52659'>You see how we come at once upon a most fruitful line of inquiry.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52660' title='52660'>We were compelled to spend the night at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Winchester&t=h'>Winchester</a>, as the formalities had not yet been completed, but next morning, in the company of Mr Joyce Cummings, the rising barrister who was entrusted with the defence, we were allowed to see the young lady in her cell. </span>
<span sid='52661' title='52661'>I had expected from all that we had heard to see a beautiful woman, but I can never forget the effect which Miss Dunbar produced upon me. </span>
<span sid='52662' title='52662'>It was no wonder that even the masterful millionaire had found in her something more powerful than himself - something which could control and guide him. </span>
<span sid='52663' title='52663'>One felt, too, as one looked at that strong, clear-cut and yet sensitive face, that even should she be capable of some impetuous deed, none the less there was an innate nobility of character which would make her influence always for the good. </span>
<span sid='52664' title='52664'>She was a brunette, tall, with a noble figure and commanding presence, but her dark eyes had in them this appealing, helpless expression of the hunted creature who feels the nets around it, but can see no way out from the toils. </span>
<span sid='52665' title='52665'>Now, as she realized the presence and the help of my famous friend, there came a touch of colour in her wan cheeks and a light of hope began to glimmer in the glance which she turned upon us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52666' title='52666'>'Perhaps Mr Neil Gibson has told you something of what occurred between us?' she asked, in a low, agitated voice.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52667' title='52667'>'Yes,' Holmes answered, 'you need not pain yourself by entering into that part of the story. </span>
<span sid='52668' title='52668'>After seeing you, I am prepared to accept Mr Gibson's statement both as to the influence which you had over him and as to the innocence of your relations with him. </span>
<span sid='52669' title='52669'>But why was the whole situation not brought out in court?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52670' title='52670'>'It seemed to me incredible that such a charge could be sustained. </span>
<span sid='52671' title='52671'>I thought that if we waited the whole thing must clear itself up without our being compelled to enter into painful details of the inner life of the family. </span>
<span sid='52672' title='52672'>But I understand that far from clearing it has become even more serious.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52673' title='52673'>'My dear young lady,' cried Holmes, earnestly, 'I beg you to have no illusions upon the point. </span>
<span sid='52674' title='52674'>Mr Cummings here would assure you that all the cards are at present against us, and that we must do everything that is possible if we are to win clear. </span>
<span sid='52675' title='52675'>It would be a cruel deception to pretend that you are not in very great danger. </span>
<span sid='52676' title='52676'>Give me all the help you can, then, to get at the truth.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52677' title='52677'>'I will conceal nothing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52678' title='52678'>'Tell us, then, of your true relations with Mr Gibson's wife.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52679' title='52679'>'She hated me, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='52680' title='52680'>She hated me with all the fervour of her tropical nature. </span>
<span sid='52681' title='52681'>She was a woman who would do nothing by halves, and the measure of her love for her husband was the measure also of her hatred for me. </span>
<span sid='52682' title='52682'>It is probable that she misunderstood our relations. </span>
<span sid='52683' title='52683'>I would not wish to wrong her, but she loved so vividly in a physical sense that she could hardly understand the mental, and even spiritual, tie which held her husband to me, or imagine that it was only my desire to influence his power to good ends which kept me under his roof. </span>
<span sid='52684' title='52684'>I can see now that I was wrong. </span>
<span sid='52685' title='52685'>Nothing could justify me in remaining where I was a cause of unhappiness, and yet it is certain that the unhappiness would have remained even if I had left the house.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52686' title='52686'>'Now, Miss Dunbar,' said Holmes, 'I beg you to tell us exactly what occurred that evening.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52687' title='52687'>'I can tell you the truth so far as I know it, Mr Holmes, but I am in a position to prove nothing, and there are points - the most vital points - which I can neither explain nor can I imagine any explanation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52688' title='52688'>'If you will find the facts, perhaps others may find the explanation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52689' title='52689'>'With regard, then, to my presence at Thor Bridge that night, I received a note from Mrs Gibson in the morning. </span>
<span sid='52690' title='52690'>It lay on the table of the schoolroom, and it may have been left there by her own hand. </span>
<span sid='52691' title='52691'>It implored me to see her there after dinner, said she had something important to say to me, and asked me to leave an answer on the sundial in the garden, as she desired no one to be in our confidence. </span>
<span sid='52692' title='52692'>I saw no reason for such secrecy, but I did as she asked, accepting the appointment. </span>
<span sid='52693' title='52693'>She asked me to destroy her note and I burned it in the schoolroom grate. </span>
<span sid='52694' title='52694'>She was very much afraid of her husband, who treated her with a harshness for which I frequently reproached him, and I could only imagine that she acted in this way because she did not wish him to know of our interview.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52695' title='52695'>'Yet she kept your reply very carefully?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52696' title='52696'>'Yes. </span>
<span sid='52697' title='52697'>I was surprised to hear that she had it in her hand when she died.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52698' title='52698'>'Well, what happened then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52699' title='52699'>'I went down as I had promised. </span>
<span sid='52700' title='52700'>When I reached the bridge she was waiting for me. </span>
<span sid='52701' title='52701'>Never did I realize till that moment how this poor creature hated me. </span>
<span sid='52702' title='52702'>She was like a mad woman - indeed, I think she was a mad woman, subtly mad with the deep power of deception which insane people may have. </span>
<span sid='52703' title='52703'>How else could she have met me with unconcern every day and yet had so raging a hatred of me in her heart? </span>
<span sid='52704' title='52704'>I will not say what she said. </span>
<span sid='52705' title='52705'>She poured her whole wild fury out in burning and horrible words. </span>
<span sid='52706' title='52706'>I did not even answer - I could not. </span>
<span sid='52707' title='52707'>It was dreadful to see her. </span>
<span sid='52708' title='52708'>I put my hands to my ears and rushed away. </span>
<span sid='52709' title='52709'>When I left her she was standing still shrieking out her curses at me, in the mouth of the bridge.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52710' title='52710'>'Where she was afterwards found?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='52711' title='52711'>'Within a few yards from the spot.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52712' title='52712'>'And yet, presuming that she met her death shortly after you left her, you heard no shot?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52713' title='52713'>'No, I heard nothing. </span>
<span sid='52714' title='52714'>But, indeed, Mr Holmes, I was so agitated and horrified by this terrible outbreak that I rushed to get back to the peace of my own room, and I was incapable of noticing anything which happened.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52715' title='52715'>'You say that you returned to your room. </span>
<span sid='52716' title='52716'>Did you leave it again before next morning?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52717' title='52717'>'Yes, when the alarm came that the poor creature had met her death I ran out with the others.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52718' title='52718'>'Did you see Mr Gibson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52719' title='52719'>'Yes, he had just returned from the bridge when I saw him. </span>
<span sid='52720' title='52720'>He had sent for the doctor and the police.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52721' title='52721'>'Did he seem to you much perturbed?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52722' title='52722'>'Mr Gibson is a very strong, self-contained man. </span>
<span sid='52723' title='52723'>I do not think that he would ever show his emotions on the surface. </span>
<span sid='52724' title='52724'>But I, who knew him so well, could see that he was deeply concerned.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52725' title='52725'>'Then we come to the all-important point. </span>
<span sid='52726' title='52726'>This pistol that was found in your room. </span>
<span sid='52727' title='52727'>Had you ever seen it before?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52728' title='52728'>'Never, I swear it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52729' title='52729'>'When was it found?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52730' title='52730'>'Next morning, when the police made their search.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52731' title='52731'>'Among your clothes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52732' title='52732'>'Yes, on the floor of my wardrobe under my dresses.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52733' title='52733'>'You could not guess how long it had been there?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52734' title='52734'>'It had not been there the morning before.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52735' title='52735'>'How do you know?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52736' title='52736'>'Because I tidied out the wardrobe.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52737' title='52737'>'That is final. </span>
<span sid='52738' title='52738'>Then someone came into your room and placed the pistol there in order to inculpate you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52739' title='52739'>'It must have been so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52740' title='52740'>'And when?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52741' title='52741'>'It could only have been at meal-time, or else at the hours when I would be in the schoolroom with the children.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52742' title='52742'>'As you were when you got the note?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52743' title='52743'>'Yes, from that time onwards for the whole morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52744' title='52744'>'Thank you, Miss Dunbar. </span>
<span sid='52745' title='52745'>Is there any other point which could help me in the investigation?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52746' title='52746'>'I can think of none.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52747' title='52747'>'There was some sign of violence on the stonework of the bridge - a perfectly fresh chip just opposite the body. </span>
<span sid='52748' title='52748'>Could you suggest any possible explanation of that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52749' title='52749'>'Surely it must be a mere coincidence.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52750' title='52750'>'Curious, Miss Dunbar, very curious. </span>
<span sid='52751' title='52751'>Why should it appear at the very time of the tragedy and why at the very place?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52752' title='52752'>'But what could have caused it? </span>
<span sid='52753' title='52753'>Only great violence could have such an effect.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52754' title='52754'>Holmes did not answer. </span>
<span sid='52755' title='52755'>His pale, eager face had suddenly assumed that tense, far-away expression which I had learned to associate with the supreme manifestations of his genius. </span>
<span sid='52756' title='52756'>So evident was the crisis in his mind that none of us dared to speak, and we sat, barrister, prisoner, and myself, watching him in a concentrated and absorbed silence. </span>
<span sid='52757' title='52757'>Suddenly he sprang from his chair, vibrating with nervous energy and the pressing need for action.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52758' title='52758'>'Come, Watson, come!' he cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52759' title='52759'>'What is it, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52760' title='52760'>'Never mind, my dear lady. </span>
<span sid='52761' title='52761'>You will hear from me, Mr Cummings. </span>
<span sid='52762' title='52762'>With the help of the God of justice I will give you a case which will make <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> ring. </span>
<span sid='52763' title='52763'>You will get news by tomorrow, Miss Dunbar, and meanwhile take my assurance that the clouds are lifting and that I have every hope that the light of truth is breaking through.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52764' title='52764'>It was not a long journey from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Winchester&t=h'>Winchester</a> to Thor Place, but it was long to me in my impatience, while for Holmes it was evident that it seemed endless, for, in his nervous restlessness, he could not sit still, but paced the carriage or drummed with his long, sensitive fingers upon the cushions beside him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52765' title='52765'>Suddenly, however, as we neared our destination he seated himself opposite to me - we had a first-class carriage to ourselves - and laying a hand upon each of my knees he looked into my eyes with the peculiarly mischievous gaze which was characteristic of his more imp-like moods.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52766' title='52766'>'Watson,' said he, 'I have some recollection that you go armed upon these excursions of ours.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52767' title='52767'>It was as well for him that I did so, for he took little care for his own safety when his mind was once absorbed by a problem, so that more than once my revolver had been a good friend in need. </span>
<span sid='52768' title='52768'>I reminded him of the fact.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52769' title='52769'>'Yes, yes, I am a little absent-minded in such matters. </span>
<span sid='52770' title='52770'>But have you your revolver on you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52771' title='52771'>I produced it from my hip-pocket, a short, handy, but very serviceable little weapon. </span>
<span sid='52772' title='52772'>He undid the catch, shook out the cartridges, and examined it with care.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52773' title='52773'>'It's heavy - remarkably heavy,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52774' title='52774'>'Yes, it is a solid bit of work.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52775' title='52775'>He mused over it for a minute.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52776' title='52776'>'Do you know, Watson,' said he, 'I believe your revolver is going to have a very intimate connection with the mystery which we are investigating.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52777' title='52777'>'My dear Holmes, you are joking.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52778' title='52778'>'No, Watson, I am very serious. </span>
<span sid='52779' title='52779'>There is a test before us. </span>
<span sid='52780' title='52780'>If the test comes off, all will be clear. </span>
<span sid='52781' title='52781'>And the test will depend upon the conduct of this little weapon. </span>
<span sid='52782' title='52782'>One cartridge out. </span>
<span sid='52783' title='52783'>Now we will replace the other five and put on the safety-catch. </span>
<span sid='52784' title='52784'>So! </span>
<span sid='52785' title='52785'>That increases the weight and makes it a better reproduction.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52786' title='52786'>I had no glimmer of what was in his mind nor did he enlighten me, but sat lost in thought until we pulled up in the little <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Hampshire&t=h'>Hampshire</a> station. </span>
<span sid='52787' title='52787'>We secured a ramshackle trap, and in a quarter of an hour were at the house of our confidential friend, the sergeant.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52788' title='52788'>'A clue, Mr Holmes? </span>
<span sid='52789' title='52789'>What is it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52790' title='52790'>'It all depends upon the behaviour of Dr Watson's revolver,' said my friend. </span>
<span sid='52791' title='52791'>'Here it is. </span>
<span sid='52792' title='52792'>Now, officer, can you give me ten yards of string?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52793' title='52793'>The village shop provided a ball of stout twine.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52794' title='52794'>'I think that this is all we will need,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='52795' title='52795'>'Now, if you please, we will get off on what I hope is the last stage of our journey.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52796' title='52796'>The sun was setting and turning the rolling <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Hampshire&t=h'>Hampshire</a> moor into a wonderful autumnal panorama. </span>
<span sid='52797' title='52797'>The sergeant, with many critical and incredulous glances, which showed his deep doubts of the sanity of my companion, lurched along beside us. </span>
<span sid='52798' title='52798'>As we approached the scene of the crime I could see that my friend under all his habitual coolness was in truth deeply agitated.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52799' title='52799'>'Yes,' he said, in answer to my remark, 'you have seen me miss my mark before, Watson. </span>
<span sid='52800' title='52800'>I have an instinct for such things, and yet it has sometimes played me false. </span>
<span sid='52801' title='52801'>It seemed a certainty when first it flashed across my mind in the cell at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Winchester&t=h'>Winchester</a>, but one drawback of an active mind is that one can always conceive alternative explanations which would make our scent a false one. </span>
<span sid='52802' title='52802'>And yet - and yet - Well, Watson, we can but try.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52803' title='52803'>As he walked he had firmly tied one end of the string to the handle of the revolver. </span>
<span sid='52804' title='52804'>We had now reached the scene of the tragedy. </span>
<span sid='52805' title='52805'>With great care he marked out under the guidance of the policeman the exact spot where the body had been stretched. </span>
<span sid='52806' title='52806'>He then hunted among the heather and the ferns until he found a considerable stone. </span>
<span sid='52807' title='52807'>This he secured to the other end of his line of string, and he hung it over the parapet of the bridge so that it swung clear above the water. </span>
<span sid='52808' title='52808'>He then stood on the fatal spot, some distance from the edge of the bridge, with my revolver in his hand, the string being taut between the weapon and the heavy stone on the farther side.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52809' title='52809'>'Now for it!' he cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52810' title='52810'>At the words he raised the pistol to his head, and then let go his grip. </span>
<span sid='52811' title='52811'>In an instant it had been whisked away by the weight of the stone, had struck with a sharp crack against the parapet, and had vanished over the side into the water. </span>
<span sid='52812' title='52812'>It had hardly gone before Holmes was kneeling beside the stonework, and a joyous cry showed that he had found what he expected.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52813' title='52813'>'Was there ever a more exact demonstration?' he cried. </span>
<span sid='52814' title='52814'>'See, Watson, your revolver has solved the problem!' </span>
<span sid='52815' title='52815'>As he spoke he pointed to a second chip of the exact size and shape of the first which had appeared on the under edge of the stone balustrade.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52816' title='52816'>'We'll stay at the inn to-night,' he continued, as he rose and faced the astonished sergeant. </span>
<span sid='52817' title='52817'>'You will, of course, get a grappling-hook and you will easily restore my friend's revolver. </span>
<span sid='52818' title='52818'>You will also find beside it the revolver, string and weight with which this vindictive woman attempted to disguise her own crime and to fasten a charge of murder upon an innocent victim. </span>
<span sid='52819' title='52819'>You can let Mr Gibson know that I will see him in the morning, when steps can be taken for Miss Dunbar's vindication.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52820' title='52820'>Late that evening, as we sat together smoking our pipes in the village inn, Holmes gave me a brief review of what had passed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52821' title='52821'>'I fear, Watson,' said he, 'that you will not improve any reputation which I may have acquired by adding the Case of the Thor Bridge Mystery to your annals. </span>
<span sid='52822' title='52822'>I have been sluggish in mind and wanting in that mixture of imagination and reality which is the basis of my art. </span>
<span sid='52823' title='52823'>I confess that the chip in the stonework was a sufficient clue to suggest the true solution, and that I blame myself for not having attained it sooner.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52824' title='52824'>'It must be admitted that the workings of this unhappy woman's mind were deep and subtle, so that it was no very simple matter to unravel her plot. </span>
<span sid='52825' title='52825'>I do not think that in our adventures we have ever come across a stranger example of what perverted love can bring about. </span>
<span sid='52826' title='52826'>Whether Miss Dunbar was her rival in a physical or in a merely mental sense seems to have been equally unforgivable in her eyes. </span>
<span sid='52827' title='52827'>No doubt she blamed this innocent lady for all those harsh dealings and unkind words with which her husband tried to repel her too demonstrative affection. </span>
<span sid='52828' title='52828'>Her first resolution was to end her own life. </span>
<span sid='52829' title='52829'>Her second was to do it in such a way as to involve her victim in a fate which was worse far than any sudden death could be.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52830' title='52830'>'We can follow the various steps quite clearly, and they show a remarkable subtlety of mind. </span>
<span sid='52831' title='52831'>A note was extracted very cleverly from Miss Dunbar which would make it appear that she had chosen the scene of the crime. </span>
<span sid='52832' title='52832'>In her anxiety that it should be discovered she somewhat overdid it, by holding it in her hand to the last. </span>
<span sid='52833' title='52833'>This alone should have excited my suspicions earlier than it did.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52834' title='52834'>'Then she took one of her husband's revolvers - there was, as you saw, an arsenal in the house - and kept it for her own use. </span>
<span sid='52835' title='52835'>A similar one she concealed that morning in Miss Dunbar's wardrobe after discharging one barrel, which she could easily do in the woods without attracting attention. </span>
<span sid='52836' title='52836'>She then went down to the bridge where she had contrived this exceedingly ingenious method for getting rid of her weapon. </span>
<span sid='52837' title='52837'>When Miss Dunbar appeared she used her last breath in pouring out her hatred, and then, when she was out of hearing, carried out her terrible purpose. </span>
<span sid='52838' title='52838'>Every link is now in its place and the chain is complete. </span>
<span sid='52839' title='52839'>The papers may ask why the mere was not dragged in the first instance, but it is easy to be wise after the event, and in any case the expanse of a reed-filled lake is no easy matter to drag unless you have a clear perception of what you are looking for and where. </span>
<span sid='52840' title='52840'>Well, Watson, we have helped a remarkable woman, and also a formidable man. </span>
<span sid='52841' title='52841'>Should they in the future join their forces, as seems not unlikely, the financial world may find that Mr Neil Gibson has learned something in that schoolroom of Sorrow where our earthly lessons are taught.'</span>
