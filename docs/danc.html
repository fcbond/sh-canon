<p>
<p>
<span sid='11001' title='11001'>Holmes had been seated for some hours in silence with his long, thin back curved over a chemical vessel in which he was brewing a particularly malodorous product.</span>
<span sid='11002' title='11002'>His head was sunk upon his breast, and he looked from my point of view like a strange, lank bird, with dull gray plumage and a black top-knot.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11003' title='11003'>"So, Watson," said he, suddenly, "you do not propose to invest in South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>n securities?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11004' title='11004'>I gave a start of astonishment.</span>
<span sid='11005' title='11005'>Accustomed as I was to Holmes's curious faculties, this sudden intrusion into my most intimate thoughts was utterly inexplicable.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11006' title='11006'>"How on earth do you know that?" I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11007' title='11007'>He wheeled round upon his stool, with a steaming test-tube in his hand, and a gleam of amusement in his deep-set eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11008' title='11008'>"Now, Watson, confess yourself utterly taken aback," said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11009' title='11009'>"I am."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11010' title='11010'>"I ought to make you sign a paper to that effect."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11011' title='11011'>"Why?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11012' title='11012'>"Because in five minutes you will say that it is all so absurdly simple."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11013' title='11013'>"I am sure that I shall say nothing of the kind."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11014' title='11014'>"You see, my dear Watson,"--he propped his test-tube in the rack, and began to lecture with the air of a professor addressing his class--"it is not really difficult to construct a series of inferences, each dependent upon its predecessor and each simple in itself.</span>
<span sid='11015' title='11015'>If, after doing so, one simply knocks out all the central inferences and presents one's audience with the starting-point and the conclusion, one may produce a startling, though possibly a meretricious, effect.</span>
<span sid='11016' title='11016'>Now, it was not really difficult, by an inspection of the groove between your left forefinger and thumb, to feel sure that you did NOT propose to invest your small capital in the gold fields."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11017' title='11017'>"I see no connection."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11018' title='11018'>"Very likely not; but I can quickly show you a close connection.</span>
<span sid='11019' title='11019'>Here are the missing links of the very simple chain: 1. You had chalk between your left finger and thumb when you returned from the club last night.</span>
<span sid='11020' title='11020'>2. You put chalk there when you play billiards, to steady the cue.</span>
<span sid='11021' title='11021'>3. You never play billiards except with Thurston.</span>
<span sid='11022' title='11022'>4. You told me, four weeks ago, that Thurston had an option on some South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>n property which would expire in a month, and which he desired you to share with him.</span>
<span sid='11023' title='11023'>5. Your check book is locked in my drawer, and you have not asked for the key.</span>
<span sid='11024' title='11024'>6. You do not propose to invest your money in this manner."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11025' title='11025'>"How absurdly simple!" I cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11026' title='11026'>"Quite so!" said he, a little nettled.</span>
<span sid='11027' title='11027'>"Every problem becomes very childish when once it is explained to you.</span>
<span sid='11028' title='11028'>Here is an unexplained one.</span>
<span sid='11029' title='11029'>See what you can make of that, friend Watson."</span>
<span sid='11030' title='11030'>He tossed a sheet of paper upon the table, and turned once more to his chemical analysis.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11031' title='11031'>I looked with amazement at the absurd hieroglyphics upon the paper.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11032' title='11032'>"Why, Holmes, it is a child's drawing," I cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11033' title='11033'>"Oh, that's your idea!"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11034' title='11034'>"What else should it be?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11035' title='11035'>"That is what Mr. Hilton Cubitt, of Riding Thorpe Manor, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norfolk&t=h'>Norfolk</a>, is very anxious to know.</span>
<span sid='11036' title='11036'>This little conundrum came by the first post, and he was to follow by the next train.</span>
<span sid='11037' title='11037'>There's a ring at the bell, Watson.</span>
<span sid='11038' title='11038'>I should not be very much surprised if this were he."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11039' title='11039'>A heavy step was heard upon the stairs, and an instant later there entered a tall, ruddy, clean-shaven gentleman, whose clear eyes and florid cheeks told of a life led far from the fogs of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>.</span>
<span sid='11040' title='11040'>He seemed to bring a whiff of his strong, fresh, bracing, east-coast air with him as he entered.</span>
<span sid='11041' title='11041'>Having shaken hands with each of us, he was about to sit down, when his eye rested upon the paper with the curious markings, which I had just examined and left upon the table.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11042' title='11042'>"Well, Mr. Holmes, what do you make of these?" he cried.</span>
<span sid='11043' title='11043'>"They told me that you were fond of queer mysteries, and I don't think you can find a queerer one than that.</span>
<span sid='11044' title='11044'>I sent the paper on ahead, so that you might have time to study it before I came."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11045' title='11045'>"It is certainly rather a curious production," said Holmes.</span>
<span sid='11046' title='11046'>"At first sight it would appear to be some childish prank.</span>
<span sid='11047' title='11047'>It consists of a number of absurd little figures dancing across the paper upon which they are drawn.</span>
<span sid='11048' title='11048'>Why should you attribute any importance to so grotesque an object?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11049' title='11049'>"I never should, Mr. Holmes.</span>
<span sid='11050' title='11050'>But my wife does.</span>
<span sid='11051' title='11051'>It is frightening her to death.</span>
<span sid='11052' title='11052'>She says nothing, but I can see terror in her eyes.</span>
<span sid='11053' title='11053'>That's why I want to sift the matter to the bottom."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11054' title='11054'>Holmes held up the paper so that the sunlight shone full upon it.</span>
<span sid='11055' title='11055'>It was a page torn from a notebook.</span>
<span sid='11056' title='11056'>The markings were done in pencil, and ran in this way:</span>
<span sid='11057' title='11057'>GRAPHIC</span>
<p>
<span sid='11058' title='11058'>Holmes examined it for some time, and then, folding it carefully up, he placed it in his pocketbook.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11059' title='11059'>"This promises to be a most interesting and unusual case," said he.</span>
<span sid='11060' title='11060'>"You gave me a few particulars in your letter, Mr. Hilton Cubitt, but I should be very much obliged if you would kindly go over it all again for the benefit of my friend, Dr. Watson."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11061' title='11061'>"I'm not much of a story-teller," said our visitor, nervously clasping and unclasping his great, strong hands.</span>
<span sid='11062' title='11062'>"You'll just ask me anything that I don't make clear.</span>
<span sid='11063' title='11063'>I'll begin at the time of my marriage last year, but I want to say first of all that, though I'm not a rich man, my people have been at Riding Thorpe for a matter of five centuries, and there is no better known family in the County of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norfolk&t=h'>Norfolk</a>.</span>
<span sid='11064' title='11064'>Last year I came up to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> for the Jubilee, and I stopped at a boarding-house in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Russell Square&t=h'>Russell Square</a>, because Parker, the vicar of our parish, was staying in it.</span>
<span sid='11065' title='11065'>There was an <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n young lady there--Patrick was the name--Elsie Patrick.</span>
<span sid='11066' title='11066'>In some way we became friends, until before my month was up I was as much in love as man could be.</span>
<span sid='11067' title='11067'>We were quietly married at a registry office, and we returned to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norfolk&t=h'>Norfolk</a> a wedded couple.</span>
<span sid='11068' title='11068'>You'll think it very mad, Mr. Holmes, that a man of a good old family should marry a wife in this fashion, knowing nothing of her past or of her people, but if you saw her and knew her, it would help you to understand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11069' title='11069'>"She was very straight about it, was Elsie.</span>
<span sid='11070' title='11070'>I can't say that she did not give me every chance of getting out of it if I wished to do so.</span>
<span sid='11071' title='11071'>'I have had some very disagreeable associations in my life,' said she, 'I wish to forget all about them.</span>
<span sid='11072' title='11072'>I would rather never allude to the past, for it is very painful to me.</span>
<span sid='11073' title='11073'>If you take me, Hilton, you will take a woman who has nothing that she need be personally ashamed of, but you will have to be content with my word for it, and to allow me to be silent as to all that passed up to the time when I became yours.</span>
<span sid='11074' title='11074'>If these conditions are too hard, then go back to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norfolk&t=h'>Norfolk</a>, and leave me to the lonely life in which you found me.'</span>
<span sid='11075' title='11075'>It was only the day before our wedding that she said those very words to me.</span>
<span sid='11076' title='11076'>I told her that I was content to take her on her own terms, and I have been as good as my word.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11077' title='11077'>"Well we have been married now for a year, and very happy we have been.</span>
<span sid='11078' title='11078'>But about a month ago, at the end of June, I saw for the first time signs of trouble.</span>
<span sid='11079' title='11079'>One day my wife received a letter from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>.</span>
<span sid='11080' title='11080'>I saw the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n stamp.</span>
<span sid='11081' title='11081'>She turned deadly white, read the letter, and threw it into the fire.</span>
<span sid='11082' title='11082'>She made no allusion to it afterwards, and I made none, for a promise is a promise, but she has never known an easy hour from that moment.</span>
<span sid='11083' title='11083'>There is always a look of fear upon her face--a look as if she were waiting</span>
<span sid='11086' title='11086'>But until she speaks, I can say nothing.</span>
<span sid='11087' title='11087'>Mind you, she is a truthful woman, Mr. Holmes, and whatever trouble there may have been in her past life it has been no fault of hers.</span>
<span sid='11088' title='11088'>I am only a simple <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norfolk&t=h'>Norfolk</a> squire, but there is not a man in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> who ranks his family honour more highly than I do.</span>
<span sid='11089' title='11089'>She knows it well, and she knew it well before she married me.</span>
<span sid='11090' title='11090'>She would never bring any stain upon it--of that I am sure.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11091' title='11091'>"Well, now I come to the queer part of my story.</span>
<span sid='11092' title='11092'>About a week ago--it was the Tuesday of last week--I found on one of the window-sills a number of absurd little dancing figures like these upon the paper.</span>
<span sid='11093' title='11093'>They were scrawled with chalk.</span>
<span sid='11094' title='11094'>I thought that it was the stable-boy who had drawn them, but the lad swore he knew nothing about it.</span>
<span sid='11095' title='11095'>Anyhow, they had come there during the night.</span>
<span sid='11096' title='11096'>I had them washed out, and I only mentioned the matter to my wife afterwards.</span>
<span sid='11097' title='11097'>To my surprise, she took it very seriously, and begged me if any more came to let her see them.</span>
<span sid='11098' title='11098'>None did come for a week, and then yesterday morning I found this paper lying on the sundial in the garden.</span>
<span sid='11099' title='11099'>I showed it to Elsie, and down she dropped in a dead faint.</span>
<span sid='11100' title='11100'>Since then she has looked like a woman in a dream, half dazed, and with terror always lurking in her eyes.</span>
<span sid='11101' title='11101'>It was then that I wrote and sent the paper to you, Mr. Holmes.</span>
<span sid='11102' title='11102'>It was not a thing that I could take to the police, for they would have laughed at me, but you will tell me what to do.</span>
<span sid='11103' title='11103'>I am not a rich man, but if there is any danger threatening my little woman, I would spend my last copper to shield her."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11104' title='11104'>He was a fine creature, this man of the old English soil--simple, straight, and gentle, with his great, earnest blue eyes and broad, comely face.</span>
<span sid='11105' title='11105'>His love for his wife and his trust in her shone in his features.</span>
<span sid='11106' title='11106'>Holmes had listened to his story with the utmost attention, and now he sat for some time in silent thought.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11107' title='11107'>"Don't you think, Mr.  Cubitt," said he, at last, "that your best plan would be to make a direct appeal to your wife, and to ask her to share her secret with you?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11108' title='11108'>Hilton Cubitt shook his massive head.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11109' title='11109'>"A promise is a promise, Mr. Holmes.</span>
<span sid='11110' title='11110'>If Elsie wished to tell me she would.</span>
<span sid='11111' title='11111'>If not, it is not for me to force her confidence.</span>
<span sid='11112' title='11112'>But I am justified in taking my own line--and I will."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11113' title='11113'>"Then I will help you with all my heart.</span>
<span sid='11114' title='11114'>In the first place, have you heard of any strangers being seen in your neighbourhood?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11115' title='11115'>"No."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11116' title='11116'>"I presume that it is a very quiet place.</span>
<span sid='11117' title='11117'>Any fresh face would cause comment?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11118' title='11118'>"In the immediate neighbourhood, yes.</span>
<span sid='11119' title='11119'>But we have several small watering-places not very far away.</span>
<span sid='11120' title='11120'>And the farmers take in lodgers."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11121' title='11121'>"These hieroglyphics have evidently a meaning.</span>
<span sid='11122' title='11122'>If it is a purely arbitrary one, it may be impossible for us to solve it.</span>
<span sid='11123' title='11123'>If, on the other hand, it is systematic, I have no doubt that we shall get to the bottom of it.</span>
<span sid='11124' title='11124'>But this particular sample is so short that I can do nothing, and the facts which you have brought me are so indefinite that we have no basis for an investigation.</span>
<span sid='11125' title='11125'>I would suggest that you return to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norfolk&t=h'>Norfolk</a>, that you keep a keen lookout, and that you take an exact copy of any fresh dancing men which may appear.</span>
<span sid='11126' title='11126'>It is a thousand pities that we have not a reproduction of those which were done in chalk upon the window-sill.</span>
<span sid='11127' title='11127'>Make a discreet inquiry also as to any strangers in the neighbourhood.</span>
<span sid='11128' title='11128'>When you have collected some fresh evidence, come to me again.</span>
<span sid='11129' title='11129'>That is the best advice which I can give you, Mr. Hilton Cubitt.</span>
<span sid='11130' title='11130'>If there are any pressing fresh developments, I shall be always ready to run down and see you in your <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norfolk&t=h'>Norfolk</a> home."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11131' title='11131'>The interview left Sherlock Holmes very thoughtful, and several times in the next few days I saw him take his slip of paper from his notebook and look long and earnestly at the curious figures inscribed upon it.</span>
<span sid='11132' title='11132'>He made no allusion to the affair, however, until one afternoon a fortnight or so later.</span>
<span sid='11133' title='11133'>I was going out when he called me back.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11134' title='11134'>"You had better stay here, Watson."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11135' title='11135'>"Why?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11136' title='11136'>"Because I had a wire from Hilton Cubitt this morning.</span>
<span sid='11137' title='11137'>You remember Hilton Cubitt, of the dancing men?</span>
<span sid='11138' title='11138'>He was to reach <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Liverpool&t=h'>Liverpool</a> Street at one-twenty.</span>
<span sid='11139' title='11139'>He may be here at any moment.</span>
<span sid='11140' title='11140'>I gather from his wire that there have been some new incidents of importance."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11141' title='11141'>We had not long to wait, for our <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norfolk&t=h'>Norfolk</a> squire came straight from the station as fast as a hansom could bring him.</span>
<span sid='11142' title='11142'>He was looking worried and depressed, with tired eyes and a lined forehead.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11143' title='11143'>"It's getting on my nerves, this business, Mr. Holmes," said he, as he sank, like a wearied man, into an armchair.</span>
<span sid='11144' title='11144'>"It's bad enough to feel that you are surrounded by unseen, unknown folk, who have some kind of design upon you, but when, in addition to that, you know that it is just killing your wife by inches, then it becomes as much as flesh and blood can endure.</span>
<span sid='11145' title='11145'>She's wearing away under it--just wearing away before my eyes."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11146' title='11146'>"Has she said anything yet?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11147' title='11147'>"No, Mr. Holmes, she has not.</span>
<span sid='11148' title='11148'>And yet there have been times when the poor girl has wanted to speak, and yet could not quite bring herself to take the plunge.</span>
<span sid='11149' title='11149'>I have tried to help her, but I daresay I did it clumsily, and scared her from it.</span>
<span sid='11150' title='11150'>She has spoken about my old family, and our reputation in the county, and our pride in our unsullied honour, and I always felt it was leading to the point, but somehow it turned off before we got there."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11151' title='11151'>"But you have found out something for yourself?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11152' title='11152'>"A good deal, Mr. Holmes.</span>
<span sid='11153' title='11153'>I have several fresh dancing-men pictures for you to examine, and, what is more important, I have seen the fellow."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11154' title='11154'>"What, the man who draws them?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11155' title='11155'>"Yes, I saw him at his work.</span>
<span sid='11156' title='11156'>But I will tell you everything in order.</span>
<span sid='11157' title='11157'>When I got back after my visit to you, the very first thing I saw next morning was a fresh crop of dancing men.</span>
<span sid='11158' title='11158'>They had been drawn in chalk upon the black wooden door of the tool-house, which stands beside the lawn in full view of the front windows.</span>
<span sid='11159' title='11159'>I took an exact copy, and here it is."</span>
<span sid='11160' title='11160'>He unfolded a paper and laid it upon the table.</span>
<span sid='11161' title='11161'>Here is a copy of the hieroglyphics:</span>
<span sid='11162' title='11162'>GRAPHIC</span>
<p>
<span sid='11163' title='11163'>"Excellent!" said Holmes.</span>
<span sid='11164' title='11164'>"Excellent!</span>
<span sid='11165' title='11165'>Pray continue."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11166' title='11166'>"When I had taken the copy, I rubbed out the marks, but, two mornings later, a fresh inscription had appeared.</span>
<span sid='11167' title='11167'>I have a copy of it here:"</span>
<span sid='11168' title='11168'>GRAPHIC</span>
<p>
<span sid='11169' title='11169'>Holmes rubbed his hands and chuckled with delight.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11170' title='11170'>"Our material is rapidly accumulating," said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11171' title='11171'>"Three days later a message was left scrawled upon paper, and placed under a pebble upon the sundial.</span>
<span sid='11173' title='11173'>The characters are, as you see, exactly the same as the last one.</span>
<span sid='11174' title='11174'>After that I determined to lie in wait, so I got out my revolver and I sat up in my study, which overlooks the lawn and garden.</span>
<span sid='11175' title='11175'>About two in the morning I was seated by the window, all being dark save for the moonlight outside, when I heard steps behind me, and there was my wife in her dressing-gown.</span>
<span sid='11176' title='11176'>She implored me to come to bed.</span>
<span sid='11177' title='11177'>I told her frankly that I wished to see who it was who played such absurd tricks upon us.</span>
<span sid='11178' title='11178'>She answered that it was some senseless practical joke, and that I should not take any notice of it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11179' title='11179'>"'If it really annoys you, Hilton, we might go and travel, you and I, and so avoid this nuisance.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='11180' title='11180'>"'What, be driven out of our own house by a practical joker?' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11182' title='11182'>"'Well, come to bed,' said she, 'and we can discuss it in the morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='11183' title='11183'>"Suddenly, as she spoke, I saw her white face grow whiter yet in the moonlight, and her hand tightened upon my shoulder.</span>
<span sid='11184' title='11184'>Something was moving in the shadow of the tool-house.</span>
<span sid='11185' title='11185'>I saw a dark, creeping figure which crawled round the corner and squatted in front of the door.</span>
<span sid='11186' title='11186'>Seizing my pistol, I was rushing out, when my wife threw her arms round me and held me with convulsive strength.</span>
<span sid='11187' title='11187'>I tried to throw her off, but she clung to me most desperately.</span>
<span sid='11188' title='11188'>At last I got clear, but by the time I had opened the door and reached the house the creature was gone.</span>
<span sid='11189' title='11189'>He had left a trace of his presence, however, for there on the door was the very same arrangement of dancing men which had already twice appeared, and which I have copied on that paper.</span>
<span sid='11190' title='11190'>There was no other sign of the fellow anywhere, though I ran all over the grounds.</span>
<span sid='11191' title='11191'>And yet the amazing thing is that he must have been there all the time, for when I examined the door again in the morning, he had scrawled some more of his pictures under the line which I had already seen."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11192' title='11192'>"Have you that fresh drawing?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11193' title='11193'>"Yes, it is very short, but I made a copy of it, and here it is."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11194' title='11194'>Again he produced a paper.</span>
<span sid='11195' title='11195'>The new dance was in this form:</span>
<span sid='11196' title='11196'>GRAPHIC</span>
<p>
<span sid='11197' title='11197'>"Tell me," said Holmes--and I could see by his eyes that he was much excited--"was this a mere addition to the first or did it appear to be entirely separate?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11198' title='11198'>"It was on a different panel of the door."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11199' title='11199'>"Excellent!</span>
<span sid='11200' title='11200'>This is far the most important of all for our purpose.</span>
<span sid='11201' title='11201'>It fills me with hopes.</span>
<span sid='11202' title='11202'>Now, Mr. Hilton Cubitt, please continue your most interesting statement."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11203' title='11203'>"I have nothing more to say, Mr. Holmes, except that I was angry with my wife that night for having held me back when I might have caught the skulking rascal.</span>
<span sid='11204' title='11204'>She said that she feared that I might come to harm.</span>
<span sid='11205' title='11205'>For an instant it had crossed my mind that perhaps what she really feared was that HE might come to harm, for I could not doubt that she knew who this man was, and what he meant by these strange signals.</span>
<span sid='11206' title='11206'>But there is a tone in my wife's voice, Mr. Holmes, and a look in her eyes which forbid doubt, and I am sure that it was indeed my own safety that was in her mind.</span>
<span sid='11207' title='11207'>There's the whole case, and now I want your advice as to what I ought to do.</span>
<span sid='11208' title='11208'>My own inclination is to put half a dozen of my farm lads in the shrubbery, and when this fellow comes again to give him such a hiding that he will leave us in peace for the future."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11209' title='11209'>"I fear it is too deep a case for such simple remedies," said Holmes.</span>
<span sid='11210' title='11210'>"How long can you stay in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11211' title='11211'>"I must go back to-day.</span>
<span sid='11212' title='11212'>I would not leave my wife alone all night for anything.</span>
<span sid='11213' title='11213'>She is very nervous, and begged me to come back."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11214' title='11214'>"I daresay you are right.</span>
<span sid='11215' title='11215'>But if you could have stopped, I might possibly have been able to return with you in a day or two.</span>
<span sid='11216' title='11216'>Meanwhile you will leave me these papers, and I think that it is very likely that I shall be able to pay you a visit shortly and to throw some light upon your case."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11217' title='11217'>Sherlock Holmes preserved his calm professional manner until our visitor had left us, although it was easy for me, who knew him so well, to see that he was profoundly excited.</span>
<span sid='11218' title='11218'>The moment that Hilton Cubitt's broad back had disappeared through the door my comrade rushed to the table, laid out all the slips of paper containing dancing men in front of him, and threw himself into an intricate and elaborate calculation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11219' title='11219'>For two hours I watched him as he covered sheet after sheet of paper with figures and letters, so completely absorbed in his task that he had evidently forgotten my presence.</span>
<span sid='11220' title='11220'>Sometimes he was making progress and whistled and sang at his work; sometimes he was puzzled, and would sit for long spells with a furrowed brow and a vacant eye.</span>
<span sid='11221' title='11221'>Finally he sprang from his chair with a cry of satisfaction, and walked up and down the room rubbing his hands together.</span>
<span sid='11222' title='11222'>Then he wrote a long telegram upon a cable form.</span>
<span sid='11223' title='11223'>"If my answer to this is as I hope, you will have a very pretty case to add to your collection, Watson," said he.</span>
<span sid='11224' title='11224; FIXME: missing words and concepts''>"I expect that we shall be able to go down to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norfolk&t=h'>Norfolk</a> to-morrow, and to take our friend some very definite news as to the secret of his annoyance."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11225' title='11225'>I confess that I was filled with curiosity, but I was aware that Holmes liked to make his disclosures at his own time and in his own way, so I waited until it should suit him to take me into his confidence.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11226' title='11226'>But there was a delay in that answering telegram, and two days of impatience followed, during which Holmes pricked up his ears at every ring of the bell.</span>
<span sid='11227' title='11227'>On the evening of the second there came a letter from Hilton Cubitt.</span>
<span sid='11228' title='11228'>All was quiet with him, save that a long inscription had appeared that morning upon the pedestal of the sundial.</span>
<span sid='11229' title='11229'>He inclosed a copy of it, which is here reproduced:</span>
<span sid='11230' title='11230'>GRAPHIC</span>
<p>
<span sid='11231' title='11231'>Holmes bent over this grotesque frieze for some minutes, and then suddenly sprang to his feet with an exclamation of surprise and dismay.</span>
<span sid='11232' title='11232'>His face was haggard with anxiety.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11233' title='11233'>"We have let this affair go far enough," said he.</span>
<span sid='11234' title='11234'>"Is there a train to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=North Walsham&t=h'>North Walsham</a> to-night?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11235' title='11235'>I turned up the time-table.</span>
<span sid='11236' title='11236'>The last had just gone.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11237' title='11237'>"Then we shall breakfast early and take the very first in the morning," said Holmes.</span>
<span sid='11238' title='11238'>"Our presence is most urgently needed.</span>
<span sid='11239' title='11239'>Ah!</span>
<span sid='11240' title='11240; Corrected capitalization of "here".''>Here is our expected cablegram.</span>
<span sid='11241' title='11241'>One moment, Mrs. Hudson, there may be an answer.</span>
<span sid='11242' title='11242'>No, that is quite as I expected.</span>
<span sid='11243' title='11243'>This message makes it even more essential that we should not lose an hour in letting Hilton Cubitt know how matters stand, for it is a singular and a dangerous web in which our simple <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norfolk&t=h'>Norfolk</a> squire is entangled."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11244' title='11244'>So, indeed, it proved, and as I come to the dark conclusion of a story which had seemed to me to be only childish and bizarre, I experience once again the dismay and horror with which I was filled.</span>
<span sid='11245' title='11245'>Would that I had some brighter ending to communicate to my readers, but these are the chronicles of fact, and I must follow to their dark crisis the strange chain of events which for some days made Riding Thorpe Manor a household word through the length and breadth of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11246' title='11246'>We had hardly alighted at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=North Walsham&t=h'>North Walsham</a>, and mentioned the name of our destination, when the station-master hurried towards us.</span>
<span sid='11247' title='11247'>"I suppose that you are the detectives from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>?" said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11248' title='11248'>A look of annoyance passed over Holmes's face.</span>
<span sid='11249' title='11249'>"What makes you think such a thing?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11250' title='11250'>"Because Inspector Martin from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwich&t=h'>Norwich</a> has just passed through.</span>
<span sid='11251' title='11251'>But maybe you are the surgeons.</span>
<span sid='11252' title='11252'>She's not dead--or wasn't by last accounts.</span>
<span sid='11253' title='11253'>You may be in time to save her yet--though it be for the gallows."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11254' title='11254'>Holmes's brow was dark with anxiety.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11255' title='11255'>"We are going to Riding Thorpe Manor," said he, "but we have heard nothing of what has passed there."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11256' title='11256'>"It's a terrible business," said the stationmaster.</span>
<span sid='11257' title='11257'>"They are shot, both Mr. Hilton Cubitt and his wife.</span>
<span sid='11258' title='11258'>She shot him and then herself--so the servants say.</span>
<span sid='11259' title='11259'>He's dead and her life is despaired of.</span>
<span sid='11260' title='11260'>Dear, dear, one of the oldest families in the county of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norfolk&t=h'>Norfolk</a>, and one of the most honoured."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11261' title='11261'>Without a word Holmes hurried to a carriage, and during the long seven miles' drive he never opened his mouth.</span>
<span sid='11262' title='11262'>Seldom have I seen him so utterly despondent.</span>
<span sid='11263' title='11263'>He had been uneasy during all our journey from town, and I had observed that he had turned over the morning papers with anxious attention, but now this sudden realization of his worst fears left him in a blank melancholy.</span>
<span sid='11264' title='11264'>He leaned back in his seat, lost in gloomy speculation.</span>
<span sid='11265' title='11265'>Yet there was much around to interest us, for we were passing through as singular a countryside as any in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, where a few scattered cottages represented the population of to-day, while on every hand enormous square-towered churches bristled up from the flat green landscape and told of the glory and prosperity of old <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=East Anglia&t=h'>East Anglia</a>.</span>
<span sid='11266' title='11266'>At last the violet rim of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=German Ocean&t=h'>German Ocean</a> appeared over the green edge of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norfolk&t=h'>Norfolk</a> coast, and the driver pointed with his whip to two old brick and timber gables which projected from a grove of trees.</span>
<span sid='11267' title='11267'>"That's Riding Thorpe Manor," said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11268' title='11268'>As we drove up to the porticoed front door, I observed in front of it, beside the tennis lawn, the black tool-house and the pedestalled sundial with which we had such strange associations.</span>
<span sid='11269' title='11269'>A dapper little man, with a quick, alert manner and a waxed moustache, had just descended from a high dog-cart.</span>
<span sid='11270' title='11270'>He introduced himself as Inspector Martin, of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norfolk&t=h'>Norfolk</a> Constabulary, and he was considerably astonished when he heard the name of my companion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11271' title='11271'>"Why, Mr. Holmes, the crime was only committed at three this morning.</span>
<span sid='11272' title='11272'>How could you hear of it in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> and get to the spot as soon as I?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11273' title='11273'>"I anticipated it.</span>
<span sid='11274' title='11274'>I came in the hope of preventing it."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11275' title='11275'>"Then you must have important evidence, of which we are ignorant, for they were said to be a most united couple."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11276' title='11276'>"I have only the evidence of the dancing men," said Holmes.</span>
<span sid='11277' title='11277'>"I will explain the matter to you later.</span>
<span sid='11278' title='11278'>Meanwhile, since it is too late to prevent this tragedy, I am very anxious that I should use the knowledge which I possess in order to insure that justice be done.</span>
<span sid='11279' title='11279'>Will you associate me in your investigation, or will you prefer that I should act independently?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11280' title='11280'>"I should be proud to feel that we were acting together, Mr. Holmes," said the inspector, earnestly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11281' title='11281'>"In that case I should be glad to hear the evidence and to examine the premises without an instant of</span>
<p>
<span sid='11282' title='11282'>Inspector Martin had the good sense to allow my friend to do things in his own fashion, and contented himself with carefully noting the results.</span>
<span sid='11283' title='11283'>The local surgeon, an old, white-haired man, had just come down from Mrs. Hilton Cubitt's room, and he reported that her injuries were serious, but not necessarily fatal.</span>
<span sid='11284' title='11284'>The bullet had passed through the front of her brain, and it would probably be some time before she could regain consciousness.</span>
<span sid='11285' title='11285'>On the question of whether she had been shot or had shot herself, he would not venture to express any decided opinion.</span>
<span sid='11286' title='11286'>Certainly the bullet had been discharged at very close quarters.</span>
<span sid='11287' title='11287'>There was only the one pistol found in the room, two barrels of which had been emptied.</span>
<span sid='11288' title='11288'>Mr. Hilton Cubitt had been shot through the heart.</span>
<span sid='11289' title='11289'>It was equally conceivable that he had shot her and then himself, or that she had been the criminal, for the revolver lay upon the floor midway between them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11290' title='11290'>"Has he been moved?"asked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11291' title='11291'>"We have moved nothing except the lady.</span>
<span sid='11292' title='11292'>We could not leave her lying wounded upon the floor."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11293' title='11293'>"How long have you been here, Doctor?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11294' title='11294'>"Since four o'clock."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11295' title='11295'>"Anyone else?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11296' title='11296'>"Yes, the constable here."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11297' title='11297'>"And you have touched nothing?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11298' title='11298'>"Nothing."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11299' title='11299'>"You have acted with great discretion.</span>
<span sid='11300' title='11300'>Who sent for you?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11301' title='11301'>"The housemaid, Saunders."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11302' title='11302'>"Was it she who gave the alarm?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11303' title='11303'>"She and Mrs.King, the cook."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11304' title='11304'>"Where are they now?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11305' title='11305'>"In the kitchen, I believe."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11306' title='11306'>"Then I think we had better hear their story at once."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11307' title='11307'>The old hall, oak-panelled and high-windowed, had been turned into a court of investigation.</span>
<span sid='11308' title='11308'>Holmes sat in a great, old-fashioned chair, his inexorable eyes gleaming out of his haggard face.</span>
<span sid='11309' title='11309'>I could read in them a set purpose to devote his life to this quest until the client whom he had failed to save should at last be avenged.</span>
<span sid='11310' title='11310'>The trim Inspector Martin, the old, gray-headed country doctor, myself, and a stolid village policeman made up the rest of that strange company.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11311' title='11311'>The two women told their story clearly enough.</span>
<span sid='11312' title='11312'>They had been aroused from their sleep by the sound of an explosion, which had been followed a minute later by a second one.</span>
<span sid='11313' title='11313'>They slept in adjoining rooms, and Mrs.King had rushed in to Saunders.</span>
<span sid='11314' title='11314'>Together they had descended the stairs.</span>
<span sid='11315' title='11315'>The door of the study was open, and a candle was burning upon the table.</span>
<span sid='11316' title='11316'>Their master lay upon his face in the centre of the room.</span>
<span sid='11317' title='11317'>He was quite dead.</span>
<span sid='11318' title='11318'>Near the window his wife was crouching, her head leaning against the wall.</span>
<span sid='11319' title='11319'>She was horribly wounded, and the side of her face was red with blood.</span>
<span sid='11320' title='11320'>She breathed heavily, but was incapable of saying anything.</span>
<span sid='11321' title='11321'>The passage, as well as the room, was full of smoke and the smell of powder.</span>
<span sid='11322' title='11322'>The window was certainly shut and fastened upon the inside.</span>
<span sid='11323' title='11323'>Both women were positive upon the point.</span>
<span sid='11324' title='11324'>They had at once sent for the doctor and for the constable.</span>
<span sid='11325' title='11325'>Then, with the aid of the groom and the stable-boy, they had conveyed their injured mistress to her room.</span>
<span sid='11326' title='11326'>Both she and her husband had occupied the bed.</span>
<span sid='11327' title='11327'>She was clad in her dress--he in his dressing-gown, over his night-clothes.</span>
<span sid='11328' title='11328'>Nothing had been moved in the study.</span>
<span sid='11329' title='11329'>So far as they knew, there had never been any quarrel between husband and wife.</span>
<span sid='11330' title='11330'>They had always looked upon them as a very united couple.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11331' title='11331'>These were the main points of the servants' evidence.</span>
<span sid='11332' title='11332'>In answer to Inspector Martin, they were clear that every door was fastened upon the inside, and that no one could have escaped from the house.</span>
<span sid='11333' title='11333'>In answer to Holmes, they both remembered that they were conscious of the smell of powder from the moment that they ran out of their rooms upon the top floor.</span>
<span sid='11334' title='11334'>"I commend that fact very carefully to your attention," said Holmes to his professional colleague.</span>
<span sid='11335' title='11335'>"And now I think that we are in a position to undertake a thorough examination of the room."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11336' title='11336'>The study proved to be a small chamber, lined on three sides with books, and with a writing-table facing an ordinary window, which looked out upon the garden.</span>
<span sid='11337' title='11337'>Our first attention was given to the body of the unfortunate squire, whose huge frame lay stretched across the room.</span>
<span sid='11339' title='11339'>The bullet had been fired at him from the front, and had remained in his body, after penetrating the heart.</span>
<span sid='11340' title='11340'>His death had certainly been instantaneous and painless.</span>
<span sid='11341' title='11341'>There was no powder-marking either upon his dressing-gown or on his hands.</span>
<span sid='11342' title='11342'>According to the country surgeon, the lady had stains upon her face, but none upon her hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11343' title='11343'>"The absence of the latter means nothing, though its presence may mean everything," said Holmes.</span>
<span sid='11344' title='11344'>"Unless the powder from a badly fitting cartridge happens to spurt backward, one may fire many shots without leaving a sign.</span>
<span sid='11345' title='11345'>I would suggest that Mr. Cubitt's body may now be removed.</span>
<span sid='11346' title='11346'>I suppose, Doctor, you have not recovered the bullet which wounded the lady?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11347' title='11347'>"A serious operation will be necessary before that can be done.</span>
<span sid='11348' title='11348'>But there are still four cartridges in the revolver.</span>
<span sid='11349' title='11349'>Two have been fired and two wounds inflicted, so that each bullet can be accounted for."</span>
<span sid='11350' title='11350'>"So it would seem," said Holmes.</span>
<span sid='11351' title='11351'>"Perhaps you can account also for the bullet which has so obviously struck the edge of the window?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11352' title='11352'>He had turned suddenly, and his long, thin finger was pointing to a hole which had been drilled right through the lower window-sash, about an inch above the bottom.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11353' title='11353'>"By George!" cried the inspector.</span>
<span sid='11354' title='11354'>"How ever did you see that?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11355' title='11355'>"Because I looked for it."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11356' title='11356'>"Wonderful!" said the country doctor.</span>
<span sid='11357' title='11357'>"You are certainly right, sir.</span>
<span sid='11358' title='11358'>Then a third shot has been fired, and therefore a third person must have been present.</span>
<span sid='11359' title='11359'>But who could that have been, and how could he have got away?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11360' title='11360'>"That is the problem which we are now about to solve," said Sherlock Holmes.</span>
<span sid='11361' title='11361'>"You remember, Inspector Martin, when the servants said that on leaving their room they were at once conscious of a smell of powder, I remarked that the point was an extremely important one?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11362' title='11362'>"Yes, sir; but I confess I did not quite follow you."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11363' title='11363'>"It suggested that at the time of the firing, the window as well as the door of the room had been open.</span>
<span sid='11364' title='11364'>Otherwise the fumes of powder could not have been blown so rapidly through the house.</span>
<span sid='11365' title='11365'>A draught in the room was necessary for that.</span>
<span sid='11366' title='11366'>Both door and window were only open for a very short time, however."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11367' title='11367'>"How do you prove that?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11368' title='11368'>"Because the candle was not guttered."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11369' title='11369'>"Capital!" cried the inspector."Capital!</span>
<p>
<span sid='11370' title='11370'>"Feeling sure that the window had been open at the time of the tragedy, I conceived that there might have been a third person in the affair, who stood outside this opening and fired through it.</span>
<span sid='11371' title='11371'>Any shot directed at this person might hit the sash.</span>
<span sid='11372' title='11372'>I looked, and there, sure enough, was the bullet mark!"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11373' title='11373'>"But how came the window to be shut and fastened?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11374' title='11374'>"The woman's first instinct would be to shut and fasten the window.</span>
<span sid='11375' title='11375'>But, halloa!</span>
<span sid='11376' title='11376'>What is this?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11377' title='11377'>It was a lady's hand-bag which stood upon the study table--a trim little handbag of crocodile-skin and silver.</span>
<span sid='11378' title='11378'>Holmes opened it and turned the contents out.</span>
<span sid='11379' title='11379'>There were twenty fifty-pound notes of the Bank of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, held together by an india-rubber band--nothing else.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11380' title='11380'>"This must be preserved, for it will figure in the trial," said Holmes, as he handed the bag with its contents to the inspector.</span>
<span sid='11381' title='11381'>"It is now necessary that we should try to throw some light upon this third bullet, which has clearly, from the splintering of the wood, been fired from inside the room.</span>
<span sid='11382' title='11382'>I should like to see Mrs.King, the cook, again.</span>
<span sid='11383' title='11383'>You said, Mrs.King, that you were awakened by a LOUD explosion.</span>
<span sid='11384' title='11384'>When you said that, did you mean that it seemed to you to be louder than the second one?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11385' title='11385'>"Well, sir, it wakened me from my sleep, so it is hard to judge.</span>
<span sid='11386' title='11386'>But it did seem very loud."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11387' title='11387'>"You don't think that it might have been two shots fired almost at the same instant?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11388' title='11388'>"I am sure I couldn't say, sir."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11389' title='11389'>"I believe that it was undoubtedly so.</span>
<span sid='11390' title='11390'>I rather think, Inspector Martin, that we have now exhausted all that this room can teach us.</span>
<span sid='11391' title='11391'>If you will kindly step round with me, we shall see what fresh evidence the garden has to offer."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11392' title='11392'>A flower-bed extended up to the study window, and we all broke into an exclamation as we approached it.</span>
<span sid='11393' title='11393'>The flowers were trampled down, and the soft soil was imprinted all over with footmarks.</span>
<span sid='11394' title='11394'>Large, masculine feet they were, with peculiarly long, sharp toes.</span>
<span sid='11395' title='11395'>Holmes hunted about among the grass and leaves like a retriever after a wounded bird.</span>
<span sid='11396' title='11396'>Then, with a cry of satisfaction, he bent forward and picked up a little brazen cylinder.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11397' title='11397'>"I thought so," said he, "the revolver had an ejector, and here is the third cartridge.</span>
<span sid='11398' title='11398'>I really think, Inspector Martin, that our case is almost complete."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11399' title='11399'>The country inspector's face had shown his intense amazement at the rapid and masterful progress of Holmes's investigation.</span>
<span sid='11400' title='11400'>At first he had shown some disposition to assert his own position, but now he was overcome with admiration, and ready to follow without question wherever Holmes led.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11401' title='11401'>"Whom do you suspect?"he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11402' title='11402'>"I'll go into that later.</span>
<span sid='11403' title='11403'>There are several points in this problem which I have not been able to explain to you yet.</span>
<span sid='11404' title='11404'>Now that I have got so far, I had best proceed on my own lines, and then clear the whole matter up once and for all."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11405' title='11405'>"Just as you wish, Mr. Holmes, so long as we get our man."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11406' title='11406'>"I have no desire to make mysteries, but it is impossible at the moment of action to enter into long and complex explanations.</span>
<span sid='11407' title='11407'>I have the threads of this affair all in my hand.</span>
<span sid='11408' title='11408'>Even if this lady should never recover consciousness, we can still reconstruct the events of last night and insure that justice be done.</span>
<span sid='11409' title='11409'>First of all, I wish to know whether there is any inn in this neighbourhood known as 'Elrige's'?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11410' title='11410'>The servants were cross-questioned, but none of them had heard of such a place.</span>
<span sid='11411' title='11411'>The stable-boy threw a light upon the matter by remembering that a farmer of that name lived some miles off, in the direction of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=East Ruston&t=h'>East Ruston</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11412' title='11412'>"Is it a lonely farm?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11413' title='11413'>"Very lonely, sir."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11414' title='11414'>"Perhaps they have not heard yet of all that happened here during the night?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11415' title='11415'>"Maybe not, sir."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11417' title='11417'>"Saddle a horse, my lad," said he.</span>
<span sid='11418' title='11418'>"I shall wish you to take a note to Elrige's Farm."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11419' title='11419'>He took from his pocket the various slips of the dancing men.</span>
<span sid='11420' title='11420'>With these in front of him, he worked for some time at the study-table.</span>
<span sid='11421' title='11421'>Finally he handed a note to the boy, with directions to put it into the hands of the person to whom it was addressed, and especially to answer no questions of any sort which might be put to him.</span>
<span sid='11422' title='11422'>I saw the outside of the note, addressed in straggling, irregular characters, very unlike Holmes's usual precise hand.</span>
<span sid='11423' title='11423'>It was consigned to Mr. Abe Slaney, Elrige's Farm, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=East Ruston&t=h'>East Ruston</a>, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norfolk&t=h'>Norfolk</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11424' title='11424'>"I think, Inspector," Holmes remarked, "that you would do well to telegraph for an escort, as, if my calculations prove to be correct, you may have a particularly dangerous prisoner to convey to the county jail.</span>
<span sid='11425' title='11425'>The boy who takes this note could no doubt forward your telegram.</span>
<span sid='11426' title='11426'>If there is an afternoon train to town, Watson, I think we should do well to take it, as I have a chemical analysis of some interest to finish, and this investigation draws rapidly to a close."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11427' title='11427'>When the youth had been dispatched with the note, Sherlock Holmes gave his instructions to the servants.</span>
<span sid='11428' title='11428'>If any visitor were to call asking for Mrs.Hilton Cubitt, no information should be given as to her condition, but he was to be shown at once into the drawing-room.</span>
<span sid='11429' title='11429'>He impressed these points upon them with the utmost earnestness.</span>
<span sid='11430' title='11430'>Finally he led the way into the drawing-room, with the remark that the business was now out of our hands, and that we must while away the time as best we might until we could see what was in store for us.</span>
<span sid='11431' title='11431'>The doctor had departed to his patients, and only the inspector and myself remained.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11432' title='11432'>"I think that I can help you to pass an hour in an interesting and profitable manner," said Holmes, drawing his chair up to the table, and spreading out in front of him the various papers upon which were recorded the antics of the dancing men.</span>
<span sid='11433' title='11433'>"As to you, friend Watson, I owe you every atonement for having allowed your natural curiosity to remain so long unsatisfied.</span>
<span sid='11434' title='11434'>To you, Inspector, the whole incident may appeal as a remarkable professional study.</span>
<span sid='11435' title='11435'>I must tell you, first of all, the interesting circumstances connected with the previous consultations which Mr. Hilton Cubitt has had with me in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>."</span>
<span sid='11436' title='11436'>He then shortly recapitulated the facts which have already been recorded.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11437' title='11437'>"I have here in front of me these singular productions, at which one might smile, had they not proved themselves to be the forerunners of so terrible a tragedy.</span>
<span sid='11438' title='11438'>I am fairly familiar with all forms of secret writings, and am myself the author of a trifling monograph upon the subject, in which I analyze one hundred and sixty separate ciphers, but I confess that this is entirely new to me.</span>
<span sid='11439' title='11439'>The object of those who invented the system has apparently been to conceal that these characters convey a message, and to give the idea that they are the mere random sketches of children.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11440' title='11440'>"Having once recognized, however, that the symbols stood for letters, and having applied the rules which guide us in all forms of secret writings, the solution was easy enough.</span>
<span sid='11441' title='11441'>The first message submitted to me was so short that it was impossible for me to do more than to say, with some confidence, that the symbol XXX stood for E.</span>
<span sid='11442' title='11442'>As you are aware, E is the most common letter in the English alphabet, and it predominates to so marked an extent that even in a short sentence one would expect to find it most often.</span>
<span sid='11443' title='11443'>Out of fifteen symbols in the first message, four were the same, so it was reasonable to set this down as E.</span>
<span sid='11444' title='11444'>It is true that in some cases the figure was bearing a flag, and in some cases not, but it was probable, from the way in which the flags were distributed, that they were used to break the sentence up into words.</span>
<span sid='11445' title='11445'>I accepted this as a hypothesis, and noted that E was represented by XXX.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11446' title='11446'>"But now came the real difficulty of the inquiry.</span>
<span sid='11447' title='11447'>The order of the English letters after E is by no means well marked, and any preponderance which may be shown in an average of a printed sheet may be reversed in a single short sentence.</span>
<span sid='11448' title='11448'>Speaking roughly, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, and L are the numerical order in which letters occur, but T, A, O, and I are very nearly abreast of each other, and it would be an endless task to try each combination until a meaning was arrived at.</span>
<span sid='11449' title='11449'>I therefore waited for fresh material.</span>
<span sid='11450' title='11450'>In my second interview with Mr. Hilton Cubitt he was able to give me two other short sentences and one message, which appeared--since there was no flag--to be a single word.</span>
<span sid='11451' title='11451'>Here are the symbols.</span>
<span sid='11452' title='11452'>Now, in the single word I have already got the two E's coming second and fourth in a word of five letters.</span>
<span sid='11453' title='11453'>It might be 'sever,' or 'lever,' or 'never.'</span>
<span sid='11454' title='11454'>There can be no question that the latter as a reply to an appeal is far the most probable, and the circumstances pointed to its being a reply written by the lady.</span>
<span sid='11455' title='11455'>Accepting it as correct, we are now able to say that the symbols stand respectively for N, V, and R.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11456' title='11456'>"Even now I was in considerable difficulty, but a happy thought put me in possession of several other letters.</span>
<span sid='11457' title='11457'>It occurred to me that if these appeals came, as I expected, from someone who had been intimate with the lady in her early life, a combination which contained two E's with three letters between might very well stand for the name 'ELSIE.'</span>
<span sid='11458' title='11458'>On examination I found that such a combination formed the termination of the message which was three times repeated.</span>
<span sid='11459' title='11459'>It was certainly some appeal to 'Elsie.'</span>
<span sid='11460' title='11460'>In this way I had got my L, S, and I.</span>
<span sid='11461' title='11461'>But what appeal could it be?</span>
<span sid='11462' title='11462'>There were only four letters in the word which preceded 'Elsie,' and it ended in E.</span>
<span sid='11463' title='11463'>Surely the word must be 'COME.'</span>
<span sid='11464' title='11464'>I tried all other four letters ending in E, but could find none to fit the case.</span>
<span sid='11465' title='11465'>So now I was in possession of C, O, and M, and I was in a position to attack the first message once more, dividing it into words and putting dots for each symbol which was still unknown.</span>
<span sid='11466' title='11466'>So treated, it worked out in this fashion:   .M .ERE ..E SL.NE.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11467' title='11467'>"Now the first letter CAN only be A, which is a most useful discovery, since it occurs no fewer than three times in this short sentence, and the H is also apparent in the second word.</span>
<span sid='11468' title='11468'>Now it becomes:   AM HERE A.E SLANE.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11469' title='11469'>Or, filling in the obvious vacancies in the name:   AM HERE ABE SLANEY.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11470' title='11470'>I had so many letters now that I could proceed with considerable confidence to the second message, which worked out in this fashion:   A. ELRI.ES.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11471' title='11471'>Here I could only make sense by putting T and G for the missing letters, and supposing that the name was that of some house or inn at which the writer was staying."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11472' title='11472'>Inspector Martin and I had listened with the utmost interest to the full and clear account of how my friend had produced results which had led to so complete a command over our difficulties.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11473' title='11473'>"What did you do then, sir?"asked the inspector.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11474' title='11474'>"I had every reason to suppose that this Abe Slaney was an <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n, since Abe is an <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n contraction, and since a letter from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a> had been the starting-point of all the trouble.</span>
<span sid='11475' title='11475'>I had also every cause to think that there was some criminal secret in the matter.</span>
<span sid='11476' title='11476'>The lady's allusions to her past, and her refusal to take her husband into her confidence, both pointed in that direction.</span>
<span sid='11477' title='11477'>I therefore cabled to my friend, Wilson Hargreave, of the New <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=York&t=h'>York</a> Police Bureau, who has more than once made use of my knowledge of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> crime.</span>
<span sid='11478' title='11478'>I asked him whether the name of Abe Slaney was known to him.</span>
<span sid='11479' title='11479'>Here is his reply: 'The most dangerous crook in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>.'</span>
<span sid='11480' title='11480'>On the very evening upon which I had his answer, Hilton Cubitt sent me the last message from Slaney.</span>
<span sid='11481' title='11481'>Working with known letters, it took this form:   ELSIE .RE.ARE TO MEET THY GO.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11482' title='11482'>The addition of a P and a D completed a message which showed me that the rascal was proceeding from persuasion to threats, and my knowledge of the crooks of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a> prepared me to find that he might very rapidly put his words into action.</span>
<span sid='11483' title='11483'>I at once came to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norfolk&t=h'>Norfolk</a> with my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, but, unhappily, only in time to find that the worst had already occurred."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11484' title='11484'>"It is a privilege to be associated with you in the handling of a case," said the inspector, warmly.</span>
<span sid='11485' title='11485'>"You will excuse me, however, if I speak frankly to you.</span>
<span sid='11486' title='11486'>You are only answerable to yourself, but I have to answer to my superiors.</span>
<span sid='11487' title='11487'>If this Abe Slaney, living at Elrige's, is indeed the murderer, and if he has made his escape while I am seated here, I should certainly get into serious trouble."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11488' title='11488'>"You need not be uneasy.</span>
<span sid='11489' title='11489'>He will not try to escape."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11490' title='11490'>"How do you know?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11491' title='11491'>"To fly would be a confession of guilt."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11492' title='11492'>"Then let us go arrest him."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11493' title='11493'>"I expect him here every instant."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11494' title='11494'>"But why should he come."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11495' title='11495'>"Because I have written and asked him."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11496' title='11496'>"But this is incredible, Mr. Holmes!</span>
<span sid='11497' title='11497'>Why should he come because you have asked him?</span>
<span sid='11498' title='11498'>Would not such a request rather rouse his suspicions and cause him to fly?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11499' title='11499'>"I think I have known how to frame the letter," said Sherlock Holmes.</span>
<span sid='11500' title='11500'>"In fact, if I am not very much mistaken, here is the gentleman himself coming up the drive."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11501' title='11501'>A man was striding up the path which led to the door.</span>
<span sid='11502' title='11502'>He was a tall, handsome, swarthy fellow, clad in a suit of gray flannel, with a Panama hat, a bristling black beard, and a great, aggressive hooked nose, and flourishing a cane as he walked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11504' title='11504'>"I think, gentlemen," said Holmes, quietly, "that we had best take up our position behind the door.</span>
<span sid='11505' title='11505'>Every precaution is necessary when dealing with such a fellow.</span>
<span sid='11506' title='11506'>You will need your handcuffs, Inspector.</span>
<span sid='11507' title='11507'>You can leave the talking to me."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11508' title='11508'>We waited in silence for a minute--one of those minutes which one can never forget.</span>
<span sid='11509' title='11509'>Then the door opened and the man stepped in.</span>
<span sid='11510' title='11510'>In an instant Holmes clapped a pistol to his head, and Martin slipped the handcuffs over his wrists.</span>
<span sid='11511' title='11511'>It was all done so swiftly and deftly that the fellow was helpless before he knew that he was attacked.</span>
<span sid='11512' title='11512'>He glared from one to the other of us with a pair of blazing black eyes.</span>
<span sid='11513' title='11513'>Then he burst into a bitter laugh.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11514' title='11514'>"Well, gentlemen, you have the drop on me this time.</span>
<span sid='11515' title='11515'>I seem to have knocked up against something hard.</span>
<span sid='11516' title='11516'>But I came here in answer to a letter from Mrs.Hilton Cubitt.</span>
<span sid='11517' title='11517'>Don't tell me that she is in this?</span>
<span sid='11518' title='11518'>Don't tell me that she helped to set a trap for me?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11519' title='11519'>"Mrs.Hilton Cubitt was seriously injured, and is at death's door."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11520' title='11520'>The man gave a hoarse cry of grief, which rang through the house.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11521' title='11521'>"You're crazy!" he cried, fiercely.</span>
<span sid='11522' title='11522'>"It was he that was hurt, not she.</span>
<span sid='11523' title='11523'>Who would have hurt little Elsie?</span>
<span sid='11524' title='11524'>I may have threatened her--God forgive me!--but I would not have touched a hair of her pretty head.</span>
<span sid='11525' title='11525'>Take it back--you!</span>
<span sid='11526' title='11526'>Say that she is not hurt!"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11527' title='11527'>"She was found badly wounded, by the side of her dead husband."</span>
<span sid='11528' title='11528'>He sank with a deep groan on the settee and buried his face in his manacled hands.</span>
<span sid='11529' title='11529'>For five minutes he was silent.</span>
<span sid='11530' title='11530'>Then he raised his face once more, and spoke with the cold composure of despair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11531' title='11531'>"I have nothing to hide from you, gentlemen," said he.</span>
<span sid='11532' title='11532'>"If I shot the man he had his shot at me, and there's no murder in that.</span>
<span sid='11533' title='11533'>But if you think I could have hurt that woman, then you don't know either me or her.</span>
<span sid='11534' title='11534'>I tell you, there was never a man in this world loved a woman more than I loved her.</span>
<span sid='11535' title='11535'>I had a right to her.</span>
<span sid='11536' title='11536'>She was pledged to me years ago.</span>
<span sid='11537' title='11537'>Who was this Englishman that he should come between us?</span>
<span sid='11538' title='11538'>I tell you that I had the first right to her, and that I was only claiming my own."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11539' title='11539'>"She broke away from your influence when she found the man that you are," said Holmes, sternly.</span>
<span sid='11540' title='11540'>"She fled from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a> to avoid you, and she married an honourable gentleman in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>.</span>
<span sid='11541' title='11541'>You dogged her and followed her and made her life a misery to her, in order to induce her to abandon the husband whom she loved and respected in order to fly with you, whom she feared and hated.</span>
<span sid='11542' title='11542'>You have ended by bringing about the death of a noble man and driving his wife to suicide.</span>
<span sid='11543' title='11543'>That is your record in this business, Mr. Abe Slaney, and you will answer for it to the law."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11544' title='11544'>"If Elsie dies, I care nothing what becomes of me," said the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n.</span>
<span sid='11545' title='11545'>He opened one of his hands, and looked at a note crumpled up in his palm.</span>
<span sid='11546' title='11546'>"See here, mister!" he cried, with a gleam of suspicion in his eyes, "you're not trying to scare me over this, are you?</span>
<span sid='11547' title='11547'>If the lady is hurt as bad as you say, who was it that wrote this note?"</span>
<span sid='11548' title='11548'>He tossed it forward on to the table.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11549' title='11549'>"I wrote it, to bring you here."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11550' title='11550'>"You wrote it?</span>
<span sid='11551' title='11551'>There was no one on earth outside the Joint who knew the secret of the dancing men.</span>
<span sid='11552' title='11552'>How came you to write it?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11553' title='11553'>"What one man can invent another can discover," said Holmes.</span>
<span sid='11554' title='11554'>"There is a cab coming to convey you to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwich&t=h'>Norwich</a>, Mr. Slaney.</span>
<span sid='11555' title='11555'>But meanwhile, you have time to make some small reparation for the injury you have wrought.</span>
<span sid='11556' title='11556'>Are you aware that Mrs. Hilton Cubitt has herself lain under grave suspicion of the murder of her husband, and that it was only my presence here, and the knowledge which I happened to possess, which has saved her from the accusation?</span>
<span sid='11557' title='11557'>The least that you owe her is to make it clear to the whole world that she was in no way, directly or indirectly, responsible for his tragic end."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11558' title='11558'>"I ask nothing better," said the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n.</span>
<span sid='11559' title='11559'>"I guess the very best case I can make for myself is the absolute naked truth."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11560' title='11560'>"It is my duty to warn you that it will be used against you," cried the inspector, with the magnificent fair play of the British criminal law.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11561' title='11561'>Slaney shrugged his shoulders.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11562' title='11562'>"I'll chance that," said he.</span>
<span sid='11563' title='11563'>"First of all, I want you gentlemen to understand that I have known this lady since she was a child.</span>
<span sid='11564' title='11564'>There were seven of us in a gang in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>, and Elsie's father was the boss of the Joint.</span>
<span sid='11565' title='11565'>He was a clever man, was old Patrick.</span>
<span sid='11566' title='11566'>It was he who invented that writing, which would pass as a child's scrawl unless you just happened to have the key to it.</span>
<span sid='11567' title='11567'>Well, Elsie learned some of our ways, but she couldn't stand the business, and she had a bit of honest money of her own, so she gave us all the slip and got away to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>.</span>
<span sid='11568' title='11568'>She had been engaged to me, and she would have married me, I believe, if I had taken over another profession, but she would have nothing to do with anything on the cross.</span>
<span sid='11569' title='11569'>It was only after her marriage to this Englishman that I was able to find out where she was.</span>
<span sid='11570' title='11570'>I wrote to her, but got no answer.</span>
<span sid='11571' title='11571'>After that I came over, and, as letters were no use, I put my messages where she could read them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11572' title='11572'>"Well, I have been here a month now.</span>
<span sid='11573' title='11573'>I lived in that farm, where I had a room down below, and could get in and out every night, and no one the wiser.</span>
<span sid='11574' title='11574'>I tried all I could to coax Elsie away.</span>
<span sid='11575' title='11575'>I knew that she read the messages, for once she wrote an answer under one of them.</span>
<span sid='11576' title='11576'>Then my temper got the better of me, and I began to threaten her.</span>
<span sid='11577' title='11577'>She sent me a letter then, imploring me to go away, and saying that it would break her heart if any scandal should come upon her husband.</span>
<span sid='11578' title='11578'>She said that she would come down when her husband was asleep at three in the morning, and speak with me through the end window, if I would go away afterwards and leave her in peace.</span>
<span sid='11579' title='11579'>She came down and brought money with her, trying to bribe me to go.</span>
<span sid='11580' title='11580'>This made me mad, and I caught her arm and tried to pull her through the window.</span>
<span sid='11581' title='11581'>At that moment in rushed the husband with his revolver in his hand.</span>
<span sid='11582' title='11582'>Elsie had sunk down upon the floor, and we were face to face.</span>
<span sid='11583' title='11583'>I was heeled also, and I held up my gun to scare him off and let me get away.</span>
<span sid='11584' title='11584'>He fired and missed me.</span>
<span sid='11585' title='11585'>I pulled off almost at the same instant, and down he dropped.</span>
<span sid='11586' title='11586'>I made away across the garden, and as I went I heard the window shut behind me.</span>
<span sid='11587' title='11587'>That's God's truth, gentlemen, every word of it, and I heard no more about it until that lad came riding up with a note which made me walk in here, like a jay, and give myself into your hands."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11588' title='11588'>A cab had driven up whilst the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n had been talking.</span>
<span sid='11589' title='11589'>Two uniformed policemen sat inside.</span>
<span sid='11590' title='11590'>Inspector Martin rose and touched his prisoner on the shoulder.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11591' title='11591'>"It is time for us to go."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11592' title='11592'>"Can I see her first?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='11593' title='11593'>"No, she is not conscious.</span>
<span sid='11594' title='11594'>Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I only hope that if ever again I have an important case, I shall have the good fortune to have you by my side."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11595' title='11595'>We stood at the window and watched the cab drive away.</span>
<span sid='11596' title='11596'>As I turned back, my eye caught the pellet of paper which the prisoner had tossed upon the table.</span>
<span sid='11597' title='11597'>It was the note with which Holmes had decoyed him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11598' title='11598'>"See if you can read it, Watson," said he, with a smile.</span>
<p>
<span sid='11599' title='11599'>It contained no word, but this little line of dancing men:</span>
<p>
<span sid='11601' title='11601'>"If you use the code which I have explained," said Holmes, "you will find that it simply means 'Come here at once.'</span>
<span sid='11602' title='11602'>I was convinced that it was an invitation which he would not refuse, since he could never imagine that it could come from anyone but the lady.</span>
<span sid='11603' title='11603'>And so, my dear Watson, we have ended by turning the dancing men to good when they have so often been the agents of evil, and I think that I have fulfilled my promise of giving you something unusual for your notebook.</span>
<span sid='11604' title='11604'>Three-forty is our train, and I fancy we should be back in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> for dinner."</span>
<p>
<span sid='11605' title='11605'>Only one word of epilogue.</span>
<span sid='11606' title='11606'>The <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n, Abe Slaney, was condemned to death at the winter assizes at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwich&t=h'>Norwich</a>, but his penalty was changed to penal servitude in consideration of mitigating circumstances, and the certainty that Hilton Cubitt had fired the first shot.</span>
<span sid='11607' title='11607'>Of Mrs. Hilton Cubitt I only know that I have heard she recovered entirely, and that she still remains a widow, devoting her whole life to the care of the poor and to the administration of her husband's estate.</span>
