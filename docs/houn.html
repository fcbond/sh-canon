<p>
<span sid='45682' title='45682'>CHAPTER 1 : Mr Sherlock Holmes</span>
<p>
<span sid='45683' title='45683'>Mr Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings, save upon those not infrequent occasions when he stayed up all night, was seated at the breakfast table. </span>
<span sid='45684' title='45684'>I stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left behind him the night before. </span>
<span sid='45685' title='45685'>It was a fine, thick piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as a '<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Penang&t=h'>Penang</a> lawyer'. </span>
<span sid='45686' title='45686'>Just under the head was a broad silver band, nearly an inch across. </span>
<span sid='45687' title='45687'>'To James Mortimer, MRCS, from his friends of the CCH', was engraved upon it, with the date '1884'. </span>
<span sid='45688' title='45688'>It was just such a stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to carry - dignified, solid, and reassuring.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45689' title='45689'>'Well, Watson, what do you make of it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45690' title='45690'>Holmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no sign of my occupation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45691' title='45691'>'How did you know what I was doing? </span>
<span sid='45692' title='45692'>I believe you have eyes in the back of your head.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45693' title='45693'>'I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in front of me,' said he. </span>
<span sid='45694' title='45694'>'But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of our visitor's stick? </span>
<span sid='45695' title='45695'>Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir becomes of importance. </span>
<span sid='45696' title='45696'>Let me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45697' title='45697'>'I think,' said I, following so far as I could the methods of my companion, 'that Dr Mortimer is a successful elderly medical man, well-esteemed, since those who know him give him this mark of their appreciation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45698' title='45698'>'Good!' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='45699' title='45699'>'Excellent!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45700' title='45700'>'I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a country practitioner who does a great deal, of his visiting on foot.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45701' title='45701'>'Why so?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45702' title='45702'>'Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one, has been so knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it. </span>
<span sid='45703' title='45703'>The thick iron ferrule is worn down, so it is evident that he has done a great amount of walking with it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45704' title='45704'>'Perfectly sound,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45705' title='45705'>'And then again, there is the "friends of the CCH". </span>
<span sid='45706' title='45706'>I should guess that to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose members he has possibly given some surgical assistance, and which has made him a small presentation in return.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45707' title='45707'>'Really, Watson, you excel yourself,' said Holmes, pushing back his chair and lighting a cigarette. </span>
<span sid='45708' title='45708'>'I am bound to say that in all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own small achievements you have habitually underrated your own abilities. </span>
<span sid='45709' title='45709'>It may be that you are not yourself luminous, but you are a conductor of light. </span>
<span sid='45710' title='45710'>Some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it. </span>
<span sid='45711' title='45711'>I confess, my dear fellow, that I am very much in your debt.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45712' title='45712'>He had never said as much before, and I must admit that his words gave me keen pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which I had made to give publicity to his methods. </span>
<span sid='45713' title='45713'>I was proud, too, to think that I had so far mastered his system as to apply it in a way which earned his approval. </span>
<span sid='45714' title='45714'>He now took the stick from my hands and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes. </span>
<span sid='45715' title='45715'>Then, with an expression of interest, he laid down his cigarette, and, carrying the cane to the window, he looked over it again with a convex lens.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45716' title='45716'>'Interesting, though elementary,' said he, as he returned to his favourite corner of the settee. </span>
<span sid='45717' title='45717'>'There are certainly one or two indications upon the stick. </span>
<span sid='45718' title='45718'>It gives us the basis for several deductions.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45719' title='45719'>'Has anything escaped me?' I asked, with some self-importance. </span>
<span sid='45720' title='45720'>'I trust that there is nothing of consequence which I have overlooked?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45721' title='45721'>'I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were erroneous. </span>
<span sid='45722' title='45722'>When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be frank, that in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided towards the truth. </span>
<span sid='45723' title='45723'>Not that you are entirely wrong in this instance. </span>
<span sid='45724' title='45724'>The man is certainly a country practitioner. </span>
<span sid='45725' title='45725'>And he walks a good deal.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45726' title='45726'>'Then I was right.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45727' title='45727'>'To that extent.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45728' title='45728'>'But that was all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45729' title='45729'>'No, no, my dear Watson, not all - by no means all. </span>
<span sid='45730' title='45730'>I would suggest, for example, that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt, and that when the initials "CC" are placed before that hospital the words "<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Charing Cross&t=h'>Charing Cross</a>" very naturally suggest themselves.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45731' title='45731'>'You may be right.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45732' title='45732'>'The probability lies in that direction. </span>
<span sid='45733' title='45733'>And if we take this as a working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our construction of this unknown visitor.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45734' title='45734'>'Well, then, supposing that "CCH" does stand for "<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Charing Cross&t=h'>Charing Cross</a> Hospital", what further inferences may we draw?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45735' title='45735'>'Do none suggest themselves? </span>
<span sid='45736' title='45736'>You know my methods. </span>
<span sid='45737' title='45737'>Apply them!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45738' title='45738'>'I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has practised in town before going to the country.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45739' title='45739'>'I think that we might venture a little farther than this. </span>
<span sid='45740' title='45740'>Look at it in this light. </span>
<span sid='45741' title='45741'>On what occasion would it be most probable that such a presentation would be made? </span>
<span sid='45742' title='45742'>When would his friends unite to give him a pledge of their good will? </span>
<span sid='45743' title='45743'>Obviously at the moment when Dr Mortimer withdrew from the service of the hospital in order to start in practice for himself. </span>
<span sid='45744' title='45744'>We know there has been a presentation. </span>
<span sid='45745' title='45745'>We believe there has been a change from a town hospital to a country practice. </span>
<span sid='45746' title='45746'>Is it, then, stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the occasion of the change?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45747' title='45747'>'It certainly seems probable.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45748' title='45748'>'Now, you will observe that he could not have been on the staff of the hospital, since only a man well-established in a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> practice could hold such a position, and such a one would not drift into the country. </span>
<span sid='45749' title='45749'>What was he, then? </span>
<span sid='45750' title='45750'>If he was in the hospital and yet not on the staff, he could only have been a house-surgeon or a house-physician - little more than a senior student. </span>
<span sid='45751' title='45751'>And he left five years ago - the date is on the stick. </span>
<span sid='45752' title='45752'>So your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into thin air, my dear Watson, and there emerges a young fellow under thirty, amiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of a favourite dog, Which I should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45753' title='45753'>I laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his settee and blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45754' title='45754'>'As to the latter part, I have no means of checking you,' said I, 'but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars about the man's age and professional career.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45755' title='45755'>From my small medical shelf I took down the Medical Directory and turned up the name. </span>
<span sid='45756' title='45756'>There were several Mortimers, but only one who could be our visitor. </span>
<span sid='45757' title='45757'>I read his record aloud.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45758' title='45758'>Mortimer, James, MRCS, 1882, Grimpen, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Dartmoor&t=h'>Dartmoor</a>, Devon, House-surgeon, from 1882 to 1884, at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Charing Cross&t=h'>Charing Cross</a> Hospital. </span>
<span sid='45759' title='45759'>Winner of the Jackson Prize for Comparative Pathology, with essay entitled 'Is Disease a Reversion?' </span>
<span sid='45760' title='45760'>Corresponding member of the Swedish Pathological Society. </span>
<span sid='45761' title='45761'>Author of "Some Freaks of Atavism" (Lancet, 1882), "Do We Progress?" (Journal of Psychology, March, 1883). </span>
<span sid='45762' title='45762'>Medical Officer for the parishes of Grimpen, Thorsley, and High Barrow.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45763' title='45763'>'No mention of that local hunt, Watson,' said Holmes, with a mischievous smile, 'but a country doctor, as you very astutely observed. </span>
<span sid='45764' title='45764'>I think that I am fairly justified in my inferences. </span>
<span sid='45765' title='45765'>As to the adjectives, I said, if I remember right, amiable, unambitious, and absent-minded. </span>
<span sid='45766' title='45766'>It is my experience that it is only an amiable man in this world who receives testimonials, only an unambitious one who abandons a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> career for the country, and only an absent-minded one who leaves his stick and not his visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45767' title='45767'>'And the dog?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45768' title='45768'>'Has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master. </span>
<span sid='45769' title='45769'>Being a heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle, and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible. </span>
<span sid='45770' title='45770'>The dog's jaw, as shown in the space between these marks, is too broad in my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff. </span>
<span sid='45771' title='45771'>It may have been - yes, by Jove, it is a curly-haired spaniel.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45772' title='45772'>He had risen and paced the room as he spoke. </span>
<span sid='45773' title='45773'>Now he halted in the recess of the window. </span>
<span sid='45774' title='45774'>There was such a ring of conviction in his voice that I glanced up in surprise.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45775' title='45775'>'My dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45776' title='45776'>'For the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our very doorstep, and there is the ring of its owner. </span>
<span sid='45777' title='45777'>Don't move, I beg you, Watson. </span>
<span sid='45778' title='45778'>He is a professional brother of yours, and your presence may be of assistance to me. </span>
<span sid='45779' title='45779'>Now is the dramatic moment of fate, Watson, when you hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life, and you know not whether for good or ill. </span>
<span sid='45780' title='45780'>What does Dr James Mortimer, the man of science, ask of Sherlock Holmes, the specialist in crime? </span>
<span sid='45781' title='45781'>Come in!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45782' title='45782'>The appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me since I had expected a typical country practitioner. </span>
<span sid='45783' title='45783'>He was a very tall, thin man, with a long nose like a beak, which shot out between two keen, grey eyes, set closely together and sparkling brightly from behind a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. </span>
<span sid='45784' title='45784'>He was clad in a professional but rather slovenly fashion, for his frock-coat was dingy and his trousers frayed. </span>
<span sid='45785' title='45785'>Though young, his long back was already bowed, and he walked with a forward thrust of his head and a general air of peering benevolence. </span>
<span sid='45786' title='45786'>As he entered his eyes fell upon the stick in Holmes's hand, and he ran towards it with an exclamation of joy.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45787' title='45787'>'I am so very glad,' said he. </span>
<span sid='45788' title='45788'>'I was not sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office. </span>
<span sid='45789' title='45789'>I would not lose that stick for the world.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45790' title='45790'>'A presentation, I see,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45791' title='45791'>'Yes, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45792' title='45792'>'From <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Charing Cross&t=h'>Charing Cross</a> Hospital?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45793' title='45793'>'From one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45794' title='45794'>'Dear, dear, that's bad!' said Holmes, shaking his head.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45795' title='45795'>Dr Mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45796' title='45796'>'Why was it bad?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45797' title='45797'>'Only that you have disarranged our little deductions. </span>
<span sid='45798' title='45798'>Your marriage, you say?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45799' title='45799'>'Yes, sir. </span>
<span sid='45800' title='45800'>I married, and so left the hospital, and with it all hopes of a consulting practice. </span>
<span sid='45801' title='45801'>It was necessary to make a home of my own.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45802' title='45802'>'Come, come, we are not so far wrong after all,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='45803' title='45803'>'And now, Dr James Mortimer-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45804' title='45804'>'Mister, sir, Mister - a humble MRCS.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45805' title='45805'>'And a man of precise mind, evidently.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45806' title='45806'>'A dabbler in science, Mr Holmes, a picker up of shells on the shores of the great unknown ocean. </span>
<span sid='45807' title='45807'>I presume that it is Mr Sherlock Holmes whom I am addressing and not-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45808' title='45808'>'No, this is my friend Dr Watson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45809' title='45809'>'Glad to meet you, sir. </span>
<span sid='45810' title='45810'>I have heard your name mentioned in connection with that of your friend. </span>
<span sid='45811' title='45811'>You interest me very much, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='45812' title='45812'>I had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or such well-marked supra-orbital development. </span>
<span sid='45813' title='45813'>Would you have any objection to my running my finger along your parietal fissure? </span>
<span sid='45814' title='45814'>A cast of your skull, sir, until the original is available, would be an ornament to any anthropological museum. </span>
<span sid='45815' title='45815'>It is not my intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet your skull.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45816' title='45816'>Sherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45817' title='45817'>'You are an enthusiast in your line of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am in mine,' said he. </span>
<span sid='45818' title='45818'>'I observe from your forefinger that you make your own cigarettes. </span>
<span sid='45819' title='45819'>Have no hesitation in lighting one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45820' title='45820'>The man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the other with surprising dexterity. </span>
<span sid='45821' title='45821'>He had long, quivering fingers as agile and restless as the antennae of an insect.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45822' title='45822'>Holmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the interest which he took in our curious companion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45823' title='45823'>'I presume, sir,' said he at last, 'that it was not merely for the purpose of examining my skull that you have done me the honour to call here last night and again to-day?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45824' title='45824'>'No, sir, no, though I am happy to have had the opportunity of doing that as well. </span>
<span sid='45825' title='45825'>I came to you, Mr Holmes, because I recognise that I am myself an unpractical man, and because I am suddenly confronted with a most serious and extraordinary problem. </span>
<span sid='45826' title='45826'>Recognising, as I do, that you are the second highest expert in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45827' title='45827'>'Indeed, sir! </span>
<span sid='45828' title='45828'>May I inquire who has the honour to be the first?' asked Holmes, with some asperity.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45829' title='45829'>'To the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Monsieur Bertillon must always appeal strongly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45830' title='45830'>'Then had you not better consult him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45831' title='45831'>'I said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind. </span>
<span sid='45832' title='45832'>But as a practical man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone. </span>
<span sid='45833' title='45833'>I trust, sir, that I have not inadvertently-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45834' title='45834'>'Just a little,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='45835' title='45835'>'I think, Dr Mortimer, you would do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my assistance.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45836' title='45836'>CHAPTER 2 : The Curse of the Baskervilles</span>
<p>
<span sid='45837' title='45837'>'I have in my pocket a manuscript,' said Dr James Mortimer.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45838' title='45838'>'I observed it as you entered the room,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45839' title='45839'>'It is an old manuscript.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45840' title='45840'>'Early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45841' title='45841'>'How can you say that, sir?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45842' title='45842'>'You have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all the time that you have been talking. </span>
<span sid='45843' title='45843'>It would be a poor expert who could not give the date of a document within a decade or so. </span>
<span sid='45844' title='45844'>You may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject. </span>
<span sid='45845' title='45845'>I put that at 1730.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45846' title='45846'>'The exact date is 1742.' </span>
<span sid='45847' title='45847'>Dr Mortimer drew it from his breast-pocket. </span>
<span sid='45848' title='45848'>'This family paper was committed to my care by Sir Charles Baskerville, whose sudden and tragic death some three months ago created so much excitement in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Devonshire&t=h'>Devonshire</a>. </span>
<span sid='45849' title='45849'>I may say that I was his personal friend as well as his medical attendant. </span>
<span sid='45850' title='45850'>He was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd, practical, and as unimaginative as I am myself. </span>
<span sid='45851' title='45851'>Yet he took this document very seriously, and his mind was prepared for just such an end as did eventually overtake him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45852' title='45852'>Holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it upon his knee.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45853' title='45853'>'You will observe, Watson, the alternative use of the long s and the short. </span>
<span sid='45854' title='45854'>It is one of several indications which enabled me to fix the date.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45855' title='45855'>I looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded script. </span>
<span sid='45856' title='45856'>At the head was written: </span>
<span sid='45857' title='45857'>'Baskerville Hall', and below, in large, scrawling figures: </span>
<span sid='45858' title='45858'>'1742'.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45859' title='45859'>'It appears to be a statement of some sort.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45860' title='45860'>'Yes, it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the Baskerville family.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45861' title='45861'>'But I understand that it is something more modern and practical upon which you wish to consult me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45862' title='45862'>'Most modern. </span>
<span sid='45863' title='45863'>A most practical, pressing matter, which must be decided within twenty-four hours. </span>
<span sid='45864' title='45864'>But the manuscript is short and is intimately connected with the affair. </span>
<span sid='45865' title='45865'>With your permission I will read it to you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45866' title='45866'>Holmes leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together, and closed his eyes, with an air of resignation. </span>
<span sid='45867' title='45867'>Dr Mortimer turned the manuscript to the light, and read in a high, crackling voice the following curious, old-world narrative.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45868' title='45868'>'Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there have been many statements, yet as I come in a direct line from Hugo Baskerville, and as I had the story from my father, who also had it from his, I have set it down with all belief that it occurred even as is here set forth. </span>
<span sid='45869' title='45869'>And I would have you believe, my sons, that the same Justice which punishes sin may also most graciously forgive it, and that no ban is so heavy but that by prayer and repentance it may be removed. </span>
<span sid='45870' title='45870'>Learn then from this story not to fear the fruits of the past, but rather to be circumspect in the future, that those foul passions whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not again be loosed to our undoing.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45871' title='45871'>'Know then that in the time of the Great Rebellion (the history of which by the learned Lord Clarendon I most earnestly commend to your attention) this Manor of Baskerville was held by Hugo of that name, nor can it be gainsaid that he was a most wild, profane, and godless man. </span>
<span sid='45872' title='45872'>This, in truth, his neighbours might have pardoned, seeing that saints have never flourished in those parts, but there was in him a certain wanton and cruel humour which made his name a by-word through <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the West&t=h'>the West</a>. </span>
<span sid='45873' title='45873'>It chanced that this Hugo came to love (if, indeed, so dark a passion may be known under so bright a name) the daughter of a yeoman who held lands near the Baskerville estate. </span>
<span sid='45874' title='45874'>But the young maiden, being, discreet and of good repute, would ever avoid him, for she feared his evil name. </span>
<span sid='45875' title='45875'>So it came to pass that one Michaelmas this Hugo, with five or six of his idle and wicked companions, stole down upon the farm and carried off the maiden, her father and brothers being from home, as he well knew. </span>
<span sid='45876' title='45876'>When they had brought her to the Hall the maiden was placed in an upper chamber, while Hugo and his friends sat down to a long carouse, as was their nightly custom. </span>
<span sid='45877' title='45877'>Now, the poor lass upstairs was like to have her wits turned at the singing and shouting and terrible oaths which came up to her from below, for they say that the words used by Hugo Baskerville, when he was in wine, were such as might blast the man who said them. </span>
<span sid='45878' title='45878'>At last in the stress of her fear she did that which might have daunted the bravest or most active man, for by the aid of the growth of ivy which covered (and still covers) the south wall, she came down from under the eaves, and so homeward across the moor, there being three leagues betwixt the Hall and her father's farm.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45879' title='45879'>'It chanced that some little time later Hugo left his guests to carry food and drink - with other worse things, perchance - to his captive, and so found the cage empty and the bird escaped. </span>
<span sid='45880' title='45880'>Then, as it would seem, he became as one that hath a devil, for, rushing down the stairs into the dining-hall, he sprang upon the great table, flagons and trenchers flying before him, and he cried aloud before all the company that he would that very night render his body and soul to the Powers of Evil if he might but overtake the wench. </span>
<span sid='45881' title='45881'>And while the revellers stood aghast at the fury of the man, one more wicked or, it may be, more drunken than the rest, cried out that they should put the hounds upon her. </span>
<span sid='45882' title='45882'>Whereat Hugo ran from the house, crying to his grooms that they should saddle his mare and unkennel the pack, and giving the hounds a kerchief of the maid's he swung them to the line, and so off full cry in the moonlight over the moor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45883' title='45883'>'Now, for some space the revellers stood agape, unable to understand all that had been done in such haste. </span>
<span sid='45884' title='45884'>But anon their bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed which was like to be done upon the moorlands. </span>
<span sid='45885' title='45885'>Everything was now in an uproar, some calling for their pistols, some for their horses, and some for another flask of wine. </span>
<span sid='45886' title='45886'>But at length some sense came back to their crazed minds, and the whole of them, thirteen in number, took horse and started in pursuit. </span>
<span sid='45887' title='45887'>The moon shone clear above them, and they rode swiftly abreast, taking that course which the maid must needs have taken if she were to reach her own home.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45888' title='45888'>'They had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the night shepherds upon the moorlands, and they cried to him to know if he had seen the hunt. </span>
<span sid='45889' title='45889'>And the man, as the story goes, was so crazed with fear that he could scarce speak, but at last he said that he had indeed seen the unhappy maiden, with the hounds upon her track. </span>
<span sid='45890' title='45890'>"But I have seen more than that," said he, "for Hugo Baskerville passed me upon his black mare, and there ran mute behind him such a hound of hell as God forbid should ever be at my heels."</span>
<p>
<span sid='45891' title='45891'>'So the drunken squires cursed the shepherd and rode onwards. </span>
<span sid='45892' title='45892'>But soon their skins turned cold, for there came a sound of galloping across the moor, and the black mare, dabbled with white froth, went past with trailing bridle and empty saddle. </span>
<span sid='45893' title='45893'>Then the revellers rode close together, for a great fear was on them, but they still followed over the moor, though each, had he been alone, would have been right glad to have turned his horse's head. </span>
<span sid='45894' title='45894'>Riding slowly in this fashion, they came at last upon the hounds. </span>
<span sid='45895' title='45895'>These, though known for their valour and their breed, were whimpering in a cluster at the head of a deep dip or goyal, as we call it, upon the moor, some slinking away and some, with starting hackles and staring eyes, gazing down the narrow valley before them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45896' title='45896'>'The company had come to a halt, more sober men, as you may guess, than when they started. </span>
<span sid='45897' title='45897'>The most of them would by no means advance, but three of them, the boldest, or, it may be the most drunken, rode forward down the goyal. </span>
<span sid='45898' title='45898'>Now it opened into a broad space in which stood two of those great stones, still to be seen there, which were set by certain forgotten peoples in the days of old. </span>
<span sid='45899' title='45899'>The moon was shining bright upon the clearing, and there in the centre lay the unhappy maid where she had fallen, dead of fear and of fatigue. </span>
<span sid='45900' title='45900'>But it was not the sight of her body, nor yet was it that of the body of Hugo Baskerville lying near her, which raised the hair upon the heads of these three dare-devil roisterers, but it was that, standing over Hugo, and plucking at his throat, there stood a foul thing, a great, black beast, shaped like a hound, yet larger than any hound that ever mortal eye has rested upon. </span>
<span sid='45901' title='45901'>And even as they looked the thing tore the throat out of Hugo Baskerville, on which, as it turned its blazing eyes and dripping jaws upon them, the three shrieked with fear and rode for dear life, still screaming, across the moor. </span>
<span sid='45902' title='45902'>One, it is said, died that very night of what he had seen, and the other twain were but broken men for the rest of their days.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45903' title='45903'>'Such is the tale, my sons, of the coming of the hound which is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever since. </span>
<span sid='45904' title='45904'>If I have set it down it is because that which is clearly known hath less terror than that which is but hinted at and guessed. </span>
<span sid='45905' title='45905'>Nor can it be denied that many of the family have been unhappy in their deaths, which have been sudden, bloody, and mysterious. </span>
<span sid='45906' title='45906'>Yet may we shelter ourselves in the infinite goodness of Providence, which would not for ever punish the innocent beyond that third or fourth generation which is threatened in Holy Writ. </span>
<span sid='45907' title='45907'>To that Providence, my sons, I hereby commend you, and I counsel you by way of caution to forbear from crossing the moor in those dark hours when the powers of evil are exalted.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45908' title='45908'>'This from Hugo Baskerville to his sons Rodger and John, with instructions that they say nothing thereof to their sister Elizabeth.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45909' title='45909'>When Dr Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he pushed his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at Mr Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='45910' title='45910'>The latter yawned and tossed the end of his cigarette into the fire.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45911' title='45911'>'Well?' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45912' title='45912'>'Do you find it interesting?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45913' title='45913'>'To a collector of fairy-tales.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45914' title='45914'>Dr Mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45915' title='45915'>'Now, Mr Holmes, we will give you something a little more recent. </span>
<span sid='45916' title='45916'>This is the Devon County Chronicle of June 14th of this year. </span>
<span sid='45917' title='45917'>It is a short account of the facts elicited at the death of Sir Charles Baskerville which occurred a few days before that date.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45918' title='45918'>My friend leaned a little forward and his expression became intent. </span>
<span sid='45919' title='45919'>Our visitor readjusted his glasses and began:</span>
<p>
<span sid='45920' title='45920'>'The recent sudden death of Sir Charles Baskerville, whose name has been mentioned as the probable Liberal candidate for Mid-Devon at the next election, has cast a gloom over the county. </span>
<span sid='45921' title='45921'>Though Sir Charles had resided at Baskerville Hall for a comparatively short period his amiability of character and extreme, generosity had won the affection and respect of all who had been brought into contact with him. </span>
<span sid='45922' title='45922'>In these days of nouveaux riches it is refreshing to find a case where the scion of an old county family which has fallen upon evil days is able to make his own fortune and to bring it back with him to restore the fallen grandeur of his line. </span>
<span sid='45923' title='45923'>Sir Charles, as is well known, made large sums of money in South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>n speculation. </span>
<span sid='45924' title='45924'>More wise than those who go on until the wheel turns against them, he realized his gains and returned to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> with them. </span>
<span sid='45925' title='45925'>It is only two years since he took up his residence at Baskerville Hall, and it is common talk how large were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement which have been interrupted by his death. </span>
<span sid='45926' title='45926'>Being himself childless, it was his openly expressed desire that the whole countryside should, within his own lifetime, profit by his good fortune, and many will have personal reasons for bewailing his untimely end. </span>
<span sid='45927' title='45927'>His generous donations to local and county charities have been frequently chronicled in these columns.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45928' title='45928'>'The circumstances connected with the death of Sir Charles cannot be said to have been entirely cleared up by the inquest, but at least enough has been done to dispose of those rumours to which local superstition has given rise. </span>
<span sid='45929' title='45929'>There is no reason whatever to suspect foul play, or to imagine that death could be from any but natural causes. </span>
<span sid='45930' title='45930'>Sir Charles was a widower, and a man who may be said to have been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind. </span>
<span sid='45931' title='45931'>In spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his personal tastes, and his indoor servants at Baskerville Hall consisted of a married couple named Barrymore, the husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper. </span>
<span sid='45932' title='45932'>Their evidence, corroborated by that of several friends, tends to show that Sir Charles's health has for some time been impaired, and points especially to some affection of the heart, manifesting itself in changes of colour, breathlessness, and acute attacks of nervous depression. </span>
<span sid='45933' title='45933'>Dr James Mortimer, the friend and medical attendant of the deceased, has given evidence to the same effect.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45934' title='45934'>'The facts of the case are simple. </span>
<span sid='45935' title='45935'>Sir Charles Baskerville was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking down the famous Yew Alley of Baskerville Hall. </span>
<span sid='45936' title='45936'>The evidence of the Barrymores shows that this had been his custom. </span>
<span sid='45937' title='45937'>On the 4th of June Sir Charles had declared his intention of starting next day for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, and had ordered Barrymore to prepare his luggage. </span>
<span sid='45938' title='45938'>That night he went out as usual for his nocturnal walk, in the course of which he was in the habit of smoking a cigar. </span>
<span sid='45939' title='45939'>He never returned. </span>
<span sid='45940' title='45940'>At twelve o'clock Barrymore, finding the hall door still open, became alarmed and, lighting a lantern, went in search of his master. </span>
<span sid='45941' title='45941'>The day had been wet, and Sir Charles's footmarks were easily traced down the Alley. </span>
<span sid='45942' title='45942'>Half-way down this walk there is a gate which leads out on to the moor. </span>
<span sid='45943' title='45943'>There were indications that Sir Charles had stood for some little time here. </span>
<span sid='45944' title='45944'>He then proceeded down the Alley, and it was at the far end of it that his body was discovered. </span>
<span sid='45945' title='45945'>One fact which has not been explained is the statement of Barrymore that his master's footprints altered their character from the time he passed the moor-gate, and that he appeared from thence onwards to have been walking upon his toes. </span>
<span sid='45946' title='45946'>One Murphy, a gipsy horse-dealer, was on the moor at no great distance at the time, but he appears by his own confession to have been the worse for drink. </span>
<span sid='45947' title='45947'>He declares that he heard cries, but is unable to state from what direction they came. </span>
<span sid='45948' title='45948'>No signs of violence were to be discovered upon Sir Charles's person, and though the doctor's evidence pointed to an almost incredible facial distortion - so great that Dr Mortimer refused at first to believe that it was indeed his friend and patient who lay before him - it was explained that that is a symptom which is not unusual in cases of dyspnoea and death from cardiac exhaustion. </span>
<span sid='45949' title='45949'>This explanation was borne out by the postmortem examination, which showed long-standing organic disease, and the coroner's jury returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence. </span>
<span sid='45950' title='45950'>It is well that this is so, for it is obviously of the utmost importance that Sir Charles's heir should settle at the Hall, and continue the good work which has been so sadly interrupted. </span>
<span sid='45951' title='45951'>Had the prosaic finding of the coroner not finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been whispered in connection with the affair, it might have been difficult to find a tenant for Baskerville Hall. </span>
<span sid='45952' title='45952'>It is understood that the next-of-kin is Mr Henry Baskerville, if he be still alive, the son of Sir Charles Baskerville's younger brother. </span>
<span sid='45953' title='45953'>The young man, when last heard of, was in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>, and inquiries are being instituted with a view to informing him of his good fortune.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45954' title='45954'>Dr Mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45955' title='45955'>'Those are the public facts, Mr Holmes, in connection with the death of Sir Charles Baskerville.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45956' title='45956'>'I must thank you', said Sherlock Holmes, 'for calling my attention to a case which certainly presents some features of interest. </span>
<span sid='45957' title='45957'>I had observed some newspaper comment at the time, but I was exceedingly preoccupied by that little affair of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Vatican&t=h'>the Vatican</a> cameos, and in my anxiety to oblige the Pope I lost touch with several interesting English cases. </span>
<span sid='45958' title='45958'>This article, you say, contains all the public facts?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45959' title='45959'>'It does.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45960' title='45960'>'Then let me have the private ones.' </span>
<span sid='45961' title='45961'>He leaned back, put his finger-tips together, and assumed his most impassive and judicial expression.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45962' title='45962'>'In doing so,' said Dr Mortimer, who had begun to show signs of some strong emotion, 'I am telling that which I have not confided to anyone. </span>
<span sid='45963' title='45963'>My motive for withholding it from the coroner's inquiry is that a man of science shrinks from placing himself in the public position of seeming to endorse a popular superstition. </span>
<span sid='45964' title='45964'>I had the further motive that Baskerville Hall, as the paper says, would certainly remain untenanted if anything were done to increase its already rather grim reputation. </span>
<span sid='45965' title='45965'>For both these reasons I thought that I was justified in telling rather less than I knew, since no practical good could result from it, but with you there is no reason why I should not be perfectly frank.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45966' title='45966'>'The moor is very sparsely inhabited, and those who live near each other are thrown very much together. </span>
<span sid='45967' title='45967'>For this reason I saw a good deal of Sir Charles Baskerville. </span>
<span sid='45968' title='45968'>With the exception of Mr Frankland, of Lafter Hall, and Mr Stapleton, the naturalist, there are no other men of education within many miles. </span>
<span sid='45969' title='45969'>Sir Charles was a retiring man, but the chance of his illness brought us together, and a community of interests in science kept us so. </span>
<span sid='45970' title='45970'>He had brought back much scientific information from South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>, and many a charming evening we have spent together discussing the comparative anatomy of the Bushman and the Hottentot.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45971' title='45971'>'Within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me that Sir Charles's nervous system was strained to breaking point. </span>
<span sid='45972' title='45972'>He had taken this legend which I have read you exceedingly to heart - so much so that, although he would walk in his own grounds, nothing would induce him to go out upon the moor at night. </span>
<span sid='45973' title='45973'>Incredible as it may appear to you, Mr Holmes, he was honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung his family, and certainly the records which he was able to give of his ancestors were not encouraging. </span>
<span sid='45974' title='45974'>The idea of some ghastly presence constantly haunted him, and on more than one occasion he has asked me whether I had on my medical journeys at night ever seen any strange creature or heard the baying of a hound. </span>
<span sid='45975' title='45975'>The latter question he put to me several times, and always with a voice which vibrated with excitement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45976' title='45976'>'I can well remember driving up to his house in the evening, some three weeks before the fatal event. </span>
<span sid='45977' title='45977'>He chanced to be at his hall door. </span>
<span sid='45978' title='45978'>I had descended from my gig and was standing in front of him, when I saw his eyes fix themselves over my shoulder, and stare past me with an expression of the most dreadful horror. </span>
<span sid='45979' title='45979'>I whisked round and had just time to catch a glimpse of something which I took to be a large black calf passing at the head of the drive. </span>
<span sid='45980' title='45980'>So excited and alarmed was he that I was compelled to go down to the spot where the animal had been and look around for it. </span>
<span sid='45981' title='45981'>It was gone, however, and the incident appeared to make the worst impression upon his mind. </span>
<span sid='45982' title='45982'>I stayed with him all the evening, and it was on that occasion, to explain the emotion which he had shown, that he confided to my keeping that narrative which I read to you when first I came. </span>
<span sid='45983' title='45983'>I mention this small episode because it assumes some importance in view of the tragedy which followed, but I was convinced at the time that the matter was entirely trivial and that his excitement had no justification.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45984' title='45984'>'It was at my advice that Sir Charles was about to go to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='45985' title='45985'>His heart was, I knew, affected, and the constant anxiety in which he lived, however chimerical the cause of it might be, was evidently having a serious effect upon his health. </span>
<span sid='45986' title='45986'>I thought that a few months among the distractions of town would send him back a new man. </span>
<span sid='45987' title='45987'>Mr Stapleton, a mutual friend who was much concerned at his state of health, was of the same opinion. </span>
<span sid='45988' title='45988'>At the last instant came this terrible catastrophe.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45989' title='45989'>'On the night of Sir Charles's death Barrymore the butler, who made the discovery, sent Perkins the groom on horseback to me, and as I was sitting up late I was able to reach Baskerville Hall within an hour of the event. </span>
<span sid='45990' title='45990'>I checked and corroborated all the facts which were mentioned at the inquest. </span>
<span sid='45991' title='45991'>I followed the footsteps down the Yew Alley, I saw the spot at the moor-gate where he seemed to have waited. </span>
<span sid='45992' title='45992'>I remarked the change in the shape of the prints after that point, I noted that there were no other footsteps save those of Barrymore on the soft gravel, and finally I carefully examined the body, which had not been touched until my arrival. </span>
<span sid='45993' title='45993'>Sir Charles lay on his face, his arms out, his fingers dug into the ground, and his features convulsed with some strong emotion to such an extent that I could hardly have sworn to his identity. </span>
<span sid='45994' title='45994'>There was certainly no physical injury of any kind. </span>
<span sid='45995' title='45995'>But one false statement was made by Barrymore at the inquest. </span>
<span sid='45996' title='45996'>He said that there were no traces upon the ground round the body. </span>
<span sid='45997' title='45997'>He did not observe any. </span>
<span sid='45998' title='45998'>But I did - some little distance off, but fresh and clear.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45999' title='45999'>'Footprints?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46000' title='46000'>'Footprints.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46001' title='46001'>'A man's or a woman's?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46002' title='46002'>Dr Mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant, and his voice sank almost to a whisper as he answered:</span>
<p>
<span sid='46003' title='46003'>'Mr Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46004' title='46004'>CHAPTER 3 : The Problem</span>
<p>
<span sid='46005' title='46005'>I confess that at these words a shudder passed through me. </span>
<span sid='46006' title='46006'>There was a thrill in the doctor's voice which showed that he was himself deeply moved by that which he told us. </span>
<span sid='46007' title='46007'>Holmes leaned forward in his excitement, and his eyes had the hard, dry glitter which shot from them when he was keenly interested.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46008' title='46008'>'You saw this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46009' title='46009'>'As clearly as I see you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46010' title='46010'>'And you said nothing?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46011' title='46011'>'What was the use?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46012' title='46012'>'How was it that no one else saw it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46013' title='46013'>'The marks were some twenty yards from the body, and no one gave them a thought. </span>
<span sid='46014' title='46014'>I don't suppose I should have done so had I not known this legend.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46015' title='46015'>'There are many sheep-dogs on the moor?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46016' title='46016'>'No doubt, but this was no sheep-dog.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46017' title='46017'>'You say it was large?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46018' title='46018'>'Enormous.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46019' title='46019'>'But it had not approached the body?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46020' title='46020'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46021' title='46021'>'What sort of night was it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46022' title='46022'>'Damp and raw.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46023' title='46023'>'But not actually raining?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46024' title='46024'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46025' title='46025'>'What is the alley like?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46026' title='46026'>'There are two lines of old yew hedge, twelve feet high and impenetrable. </span>
<span sid='46027' title='46027'>The walk in the centre is about eight feet across.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46028' title='46028'>'Is there anything between the hedges and the Walk?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46029' title='46029'>'Yes, there is a strip of grass about six feet broad on either side.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46030' title='46030'>'I understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a gate?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46031' title='46031'>'Yes, the wicket-gate which leads on to the moor.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46032' title='46032'>'Is there any other opening?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46033' title='46033'>'None.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46034' title='46034'>'So that to reach the Yew Alley one either has to come down it from the house or else to enter it by the moor-gate?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46035' title='46035'>'There is an exit through a summer-house at the far end.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46036' title='46036'>'Had Sir Charles reached this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46037' title='46037'>'No, he lay about fifty yards from it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46038' title='46038'>'Now, tell me, Dr Mortimer - and this is important - the marks which you saw were on the path and not on the grass?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46039' title='46039'>'No marks could show on the grass.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46040' title='46040'>'Were they on the same side of the path as the moorgate?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46041' title='46041'>'Yes, they were on the edge of the path on the same side as the moor-gate.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46042' title='46042'>'You interest me exceedingly. </span>
<span sid='46043' title='46043'>Another point. </span>
<span sid='46044' title='46044'>Was the wicket-gate closed?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46045' title='46045'>'Closed and padlocked.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46046' title='46046'>'How high was it?</span>
<p>
<span sid='46047' title='46047'>'About four feet high.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46048' title='46048'>'Then anyone could have got over it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46049' title='46049'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46050' title='46050'>'And what marks did you see by the wicket-gate?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46051' title='46051'>'None in particular.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46052' title='46052'>'Good Heaven! </span>
<span sid='46053' title='46053'>Did no one examine?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46054' title='46054'>'Yes, I examined myself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46055' title='46055'>'And found nothing?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46056' title='46056'>'It was all very confused. </span>
<span sid='46057' title='46057'>Sir Charles had evidently stood there for five or ten minutes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46058' title='46058'>'How do you know that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46059' title='46059'>'Because the ash had twice dropped from his cigar.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46060' title='46060'>'Excellent! </span>
<span sid='46061' title='46061'>This is a colleague, Watson, after our own heart. </span>
<span sid='46062' title='46062'>But the marks?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46063' title='46063'>'He had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel. </span>
<span sid='46064' title='46064'>I could discern no others.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46065' title='46065'>Sherlock Holmes struck his hand against his knee with an impatient gesture.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46066' title='46066'>'If I had only been there!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='46067' title='46067'>'It is evidently a case of extraordinary interest, and one which presented immense opportunities to the scientific expert. </span>
<span sid='46068' title='46068'>That gravel page upon which I might have read so much has been long ere this smudged by the rain and defaced by the clogs of curious peasants. </span>
<span sid='46069' title='46069'>Oh, Dr Mortimer, Dr Mortimer, to think that you should not have called me in! </span>
<span sid='46070' title='46070'>You have indeed much to answer for.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46071' title='46071'>'I could not call you in, Mr Holmes, without disclosing these facts to the world, and I have already given my reasons for not wishing to do so. </span>
<span sid='46072' title='46072'>Besides, besides-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46073' title='46073'>'Why do you hesitate?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46074' title='46074'>'There is a realm in which the most acute and most experienced of detectives is helpless.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46075' title='46075'>'You mean that the thing is supernatural?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46076' title='46076'>'I did not positively say so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46077' title='46077'>'No, but you evidently think it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46078' title='46078'>'Since the tragedy, Mr Holmes, there have come to my ears several incidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled order of Nature.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46079' title='46079'>'For example?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46080' title='46080'>'I find that before the terrible event occurred several people had seen a creature upon the moor which corresponds with this Baskerville demon, and which could not possibly be any animal known to science. </span>
<span sid='46081' title='46081'>They all agreed that it was a huge creature, luminous, ghastly, and spectral. </span>
<span sid='46082' title='46082'>I have cross-examined these men, one of them a hardheaded countryman, one a farrier, and one a moorland farmer, who all tell the same story of this dreadful apparition, exactly corresponding to the hell-hound of the legend. </span>
<span sid='46083' title='46083'>I assure you that there is a reign of terror in the district, and that it is a hardy man who will cross the moor at night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46084' title='46084'>'And you, a trained man of science, believe it to be supernatural?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46085' title='46085'>'I do not know what to believe.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46086' title='46086'>Holmes shrugged his shoulders. </span>
<span sid='46087' title='46087'>'I have hitherto confined my investigations to this world,' said he. </span>
<span sid='46088' title='46088'>'In a modest way I have combated evil, but to take on the Father of Evil himself would, perhaps, be too ambitious a task. </span>
<span sid='46089' title='46089'>Yet you must admit that the footmark is material.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46090' title='46090'>'The original hound was material enough to tug a man's throat out, and yet he was diabolical as well.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46091' title='46091'>'I see that you have quite gone over to the super-naturalists. </span>
<span sid='46092' title='46092'>But now, Dr Mortimer, tell me this. </span>
<span sid='46093' title='46093'>If you hold these views, why have you come to consult me at all? </span>
<span sid='46094' title='46094'>You tell me in the same breath that it is useless to investigate Sir Charles's death, and that you desire me to do it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46095' title='46095'>'I did not say that I desired you to do it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46096' title='46096'>'Then, how can I assist you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46097' title='46097'>'By advising me as to what I should do with Sir Henry Baskerville, who arrives at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Waterloo Station&t=h'>Waterloo Station</a>' - Dr Mortimer looked at his watch - 'in exactly one hour and a quarter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46098' title='46098'>'He being the heir?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46099' title='46099'>'Yes. </span>
<span sid='46100' title='46100'>On the death of Sir Charles we inquired for this young gentleman, and found that he had been farming in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Canada&t=h'>Canada</a>. </span>
<span sid='46101' title='46101'>From the accounts which have reached us he is an excellent fellow in every way. </span>
<span sid='46102' title='46102'>I speak now not as a medical man but as a trustee and executor of Sir Charles's will.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46103' title='46103'>'There is no other claimant, I presume?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46104' title='46104'>'None. </span>
<span sid='46105' title='46105'>The only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was Rodger Baskerville, the youngest of three brothers of whom poor Sir Charles was the elder. </span>
<span sid='46106' title='46106'>The second brother, who died young, is the father of this lad Henry. </span>
<span sid='46107' title='46107'>The third, Rodger, was the black sheep of the family. </span>
<span sid='46108' title='46108'>He came of the old masterful Baskerville strain, and was the very image, they tell me, of the family picture of old Hugo. </span>
<span sid='46109' title='46109'>He made <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> too hot to hold him, fled to Central <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>, and died there in 1876 of yellow fever. </span>
<span sid='46110' title='46110'>Henry is the last of the Baskervilles. </span>
<span sid='46111' title='46111'>In one hour and five minutes I meet him at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Waterloo Station&t=h'>Waterloo Station</a>. </span>
<span sid='46112' title='46112'>I have had a wire that he arrived at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Southampton&t=h'>Southampton</a> this morning. </span>
<span sid='46113' title='46113'>Now, Mr Holmes, what would you advise me to do with him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46114' title='46114'>'Why should he not go to the home of his fathers?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46115' title='46115'>'It seems natural, does it not? </span>
<span sid='46116' title='46116'>And yet, consider that every Baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate. </span>
<span sid='46117' title='46117'>I feel sure that if Sir Charles could have spoken with me before his death he would have warned me against bringing this the last of the old race, and the heir to great wealth, to that deadly place. </span>
<span sid='46118' title='46118'>And yet it cannot be denied that the prosperity of the whole poor, bleak country-side depends upon his presence. </span>
<span sid='46119' title='46119'>All the good work which has been done by Sir Charles will crash to the ground if there is no tenant of the Hall. </span>
<span sid='46120' title='46120'>I fear lest I should be swayed too much by my own obvious interest in the matter, and that is why I bring the case before you and ask for your advice.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46121' title='46121'>Holmes considered for a little time. </span>
<span sid='46122' title='46122'>'Put into plain words, the matter is this,' said he. </span>
<span sid='46123' title='46123'>'In your opinion there is a diabolical agency which makes <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Dartmoor&t=h'>Dartmoor</a> an unsafe abode for a Baskerville - that is your opinion?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46124' title='46124'>'At least I might go the length of saying that there is some evidence that this may be so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46125' title='46125'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='46126' title='46126'>But surely if your supernatural theory be correct, it could work the young man evil in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> as easily as in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Devonshire&t=h'>Devonshire</a>. </span>
<span sid='46127' title='46127'>A devil with merely local powers like a parish vestry would be too inconceivable a thing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46128' title='46128'>'You put the matter more flippantly, Mr Holmes, than you would probably do if you were brought into personal contact with these things. </span>
<span sid='46129' title='46129'>Your advice, then, as I understand it, is that the young man will be as safe in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Devonshire&t=h'>Devonshire</a> as in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='46130' title='46130'>He comes in fifty minutes. </span>
<span sid='46131' title='46131'>What would you recommend?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46132' title='46132'>'I recommend, sir, that you take a cab, call off your spaniel, who is scratching at my front door, and proceed to Waterloo to meet Sir Henry Baskerville.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46133' title='46133'>'And then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46134' title='46134'>'And then you will say nothing to him at all until I have made up my mind about the matter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46135' title='46135'>'How long will it take you to make up your mind?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46136' title='46136'>'Twenty-four hours. </span>
<span sid='46137' title='46137'>At ten o'clock tomorrow, Dr Mortimer, I will be much obliged to you if you will call upon me here, and it will be of help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring Sir Henry Baskerville with you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46138' title='46138'>'I will do so, Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46139' title='46139'>He scribbled the appointment on his shirt-cuff and hurried off in his strange, peering, absent-minded fashion. </span>
<span sid='46140' title='46140'>Holmes stopped him at the head of the stair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46141' title='46141'>'Only one more question, Dr Mortimer. </span>
<span sid='46142' title='46142'>You say that before Sir Charles Baskerville's death several people saw this apparition upon the moor?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46143' title='46143'>'Three people did.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46144' title='46144'>'Did any see it after?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46145' title='46145'>'I have not heard of any.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46146' title='46146'>'Thank you. </span>
<span sid='46147' title='46147'>Good morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46148' title='46148'>Holmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward satisfaction which meant that he had a congenial task before him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46149' title='46149'>'Going out, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46150' title='46150'>'Unless I can help you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46151' title='46151'>'No, my dear fellow, it is at the hour of action that I turn to you for aid. </span>
<span sid='46152' title='46152'>But this is splendid, really unique from some points of view. </span>
<span sid='46153' title='46153'>When you pass Bradley's, would you ask him to send up a pound of the strongest shag tobacco? </span>
<span sid='46154' title='46154'>Thank you. </span>
<span sid='46155' title='46155'>It would be as well if you could make it convenient not to return before evening. </span>
<span sid='46156' title='46156'>Then I should be very glad to compare impressions as to this most interesting problem which has been submitted to us this morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46157' title='46157'>I knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my friend in those hours of intense mental concentration during which he weighed every particle of evidence, constructed alternative theories, balanced one against the other, and made up his mind as to which points were essential and which immaterial. </span>
<span sid='46158' title='46158'>I therefore spent the day at my club, and did not return to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> until evening. </span>
<span sid='46159' title='46159'>It was nearly nine o'clock when I found myself in the sitting-room once more. </span>
<span sid='46160' title='46160'>My first impression as I opened the door was that a fire had broken out, for the room was so filled with smoke that the light of the lamp upon the table was blurred by it. </span>
<span sid='46161' title='46161'>As I entered, however, my fears were set at rest, for it was the acrid fumes of strong, coarse tobacco, which took me by the throat and set me coughing. </span>
<span sid='46162' title='46162'>Through the haze I had a vague vision of Holmes in his dressing-gown coiled up in an arm-chair with his black clay pipe between his lips. </span>
<span sid='46163' title='46163'>Several rolls of paper lay around him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46164' title='46164'>'Caught cold, Watson? said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46165' title='46165'>'No, it's this poisonous atmosphere.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46166' title='46166'>'I suppose it is pretty thick, now that you mention it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46167' title='46167'>'Thick! </span>
<span sid='46168' title='46168'>It is intolerable.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46169' title='46169'>'Open the window, then! </span>
<span sid='46170' title='46170'>You have been at your club all day, I perceive.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46171' title='46171'>'My dear Holmes!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46172' title='46172'>'Am I right?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46173' title='46173'>'Certainly, but how-?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46174' title='46174'>He laughed at my bewildered expression.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46175' title='46175'>'There is a delightful freshness about you, Watson, which makes it a pleasure to exercise any small powers which I possess at your expense. </span>
<span sid='46176' title='46176'>A gentleman goes forth on a showery and miry day. </span>
<span sid='46177' title='46177'>He returns immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his boots. </span>
<span sid='46178' title='46178'>He has been a fixture therefore all day. </span>
<span sid='46179' title='46179'>He is not a man with intimate friends. </span>
<span sid='46180' title='46180'>Where, then, could he have been? </span>
<span sid='46181' title='46181'>Is it not obvious?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46182' title='46182'>'Well, it is rather obvious.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46183' title='46183'>'The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes. </span>
<span sid='46184' title='46184'>Where do you think that I have been?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46185' title='46185'>'A fixture also.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46186' title='46186'>'On the contrary, I have been to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Devonshire&t=h'>Devonshire</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46187' title='46187'>'In spirit?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46188' title='46188'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='46189' title='46189'>My body has remained in this arm-chair, and has, I regret to observe, consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and an incredible amount of tobacco. </span>
<span sid='46190' title='46190'>After you left I sent down to Stanford's for the Ordnance map of this portion of the moor, and my spirit has hovered over it all day. </span>
<span sid='46191' title='46191'>I flatter myself that I could find my way about.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46192' title='46192'>'A large scale map, I presume?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46193' title='46193'>'Very large.' </span>
<span sid='46194' title='46194'>He unrolled one section and held it over his knee. </span>
<span sid='46195' title='46195'>'Here you have the particular district which concerns us. </span>
<span sid='46196' title='46196'>That is Baskerville Hall in the middle.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46197' title='46197'>'With a wood round it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46198' title='46198'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='46199' title='46199'>I fancy the Yew Alley, though not marked under that name, must stretch along this line, with the moor, as you perceive, upon the right of it. </span>
<span sid='46200' title='46200'>This small clump of buildings here is the hamlet of Grimpen, where our friend Dr Mortimer has his headquarters. </span>
<span sid='46201' title='46201'>Within a radius of five miles there are, as you see, only a very few scattered dwellings. </span>
<span sid='46202' title='46202'>Here is Lafter Hall, which was mentioned in the narrative. </span>
<span sid='46203' title='46203'>There is a house indicated here which may be the residence of the naturalist - Stapleton, if I remember right, was his name. </span>
<span sid='46204' title='46204'>Here are two moorland farmhouses, High Tor and Foulmire. </span>
<span sid='46205' title='46205'>Then fourteen miles away the great convict prison of Princetown. </span>
<span sid='46206' title='46206'>Between and around these scattered points extends the desolate, lifeless moor. </span>
<span sid='46207' title='46207'>This, then, is the stage upon which tragedy has been played, and upon which we may help to play it again.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46208' title='46208'>'It must be a wild place.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46209' title='46209'>'Yes, the setting is a worthy one. </span>
<span sid='46210' title='46210'>If the devil did desire to have a hand in the affairs of men-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46211' title='46211'>'Then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural explanation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46212' title='46212'>'The devil's agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not? </span>
<span sid='46213' title='46213'>There are two questions waiting for us at the outset. </span>
<span sid='46214' title='46214'>The one is whether any crime has been committed at all, the second is, what is the crime and how was it committed? </span>
<span sid='46215' title='46215'>Of course, if Dr Mortimer's surmise should be correct, and we are dealing with forces outside the ordinary laws of Nature, there is an end of our investigation. </span>
<span sid='46216' title='46216'>But we are bound to exhaust all other hypotheses before falling back upon this one. </span>
<span sid='46217' title='46217'>I think we'll shut that window again, if you don't mind. </span>
<span sid='46218' title='46218'>It is a singular thing, but I find that a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of thought. </span>
<span sid='46219' title='46219'>I have not pushed it to the length of getting into a box to think, but that is the logical outcome of my convictions. </span>
<span sid='46220' title='46220'>Have you turned the case over in your mind?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46221' title='46221'>'Yes, I have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46222' title='46222'>'What do you make of it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46223' title='46223'>'It is very bewildering.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46224' title='46224'>'It has certainly a character of its own. </span>
<span sid='46225' title='46225'>There are points of distinction about it. </span>
<span sid='46226' title='46226'>That change in the footprints, for example. </span>
<span sid='46227' title='46227'>What do you make of that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46228' title='46228'>'Mortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that portion of the alley.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46229' title='46229'>'He only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest. </span>
<span sid='46230' title='46230'>Why should a man walk on tiptoe down the alley?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46231' title='46231'>'What then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46232' title='46232'>'He was running, Watson - running desperately, running for his life, running until he burst his heart and fell dead upon his face.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46233' title='46233'>'Running from what?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46234' title='46234'>'There lies our problem. </span>
<span sid='46235' title='46235'>There are indications that the man was crazed with fear before ever he began to run.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46236' title='46236'>'How can you say that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46237' title='46237'>'I am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across the moor. </span>
<span sid='46238' title='46238'>If that were so, and it seems most probable, only a man who had lost his wits would have run from the house instead of towards it. </span>
<span sid='46239' title='46239'>If the gipsy's evidence may be taken as true, he ran with cries for help in the direction where help was least likely to be. </span>
<span sid='46240' title='46240'>Then again, whom was he waiting for that night, and why was he waiting for him in the Yew Alley rather than in his own house?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46241' title='46241'>'You think that he was waiting for someone?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46242' title='46242'>'The man was elderly and infirm. </span>
<span sid='46243' title='46243'>We can understand his taking an evening stroll, but the ground was damp and the night inclement. </span>
<span sid='46244' title='46244'>Is it natural that he should stand for five or ten minutes, as Dr Mortimer, with more practical sense than I should have given him credit for, deduced from the cigar ash?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46245' title='46245'>'But he went out every evening.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46246' title='46246'>'I think it unlikely that he waited at the moor-gate every evening. </span>
<span sid='46247' title='46247'>On the contrary, the evidence is that he avoided the moor. </span>
<span sid='46248' title='46248'>That night he waited there. </span>
<span sid='46249' title='46249'>It was the night before he was to take his departure for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='46250' title='46250'>The thing takes shape, Watson. </span>
<span sid='46251' title='46251'>It becomes coherent. </span>
<span sid='46252' title='46252'>Might I ask you to hand me my violin, and we will postpone all further thought upon this business until we have had the advantage of meeting Dr Mortimer and Sir Henry Baskerville in the morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46253' title='46253'>CHAPTER 4 : Sir Henry Baskerville</span>
<p>
<span sid='46254' title='46254'>Our breakfast-table was cleared early, and Holmes waited in his dressing-gown for the promised interview. </span>
<span sid='46255' title='46255'>Our clients were punctual to their appointment, for the clock had just struck ten when Dr Mortimer was shown up, followed by the young Baronet. </span>
<span sid='46256' title='46256'>The latter was a small, alert, dark-eyed man about thirty years of age, very sturdily built, with thick black eyebrows and a strong, pugnacious face. </span>
<span sid='46257' title='46257'>He wore a ruddy-tinted tweed suit, and had the weather-beaten appearance of one who has spent most of his time in the open air, and yet there was something in his steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated the gentleman.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46258' title='46258'>'This is Sir Henry Baskerville,' said Dr Mortimer.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46259' title='46259'>'Why, yes,' said he, 'and the strange thing is, Mr Sherlock Holmes, that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to you this morning I should have come on my own. </span>
<span sid='46260' title='46260'>I understand that you think out little puzzles, and I've had one this morning which wants more thinking out than I am able to give it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46261' title='46261'>'Pray take a seat, Sir Henry. </span>
<span sid='46262' title='46262'>Do I understand you to say that you have yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46263' title='46263'>'Nothing of much importance, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='46264' title='46264'>Only a joke, as like as not. </span>
<span sid='46265' title='46265'>It was this letter, if you can call it a letter, which reached me this morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46266' title='46266'>He laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it. </span>
<span sid='46267' title='46267'>It was of common quality, greyish in colour. </span>
<span sid='46268' title='46268'>The address, 'Sir Henry Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel', was printed in rough characters, the post-mark '<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Charing Cross&t=h'>Charing Cross</a>', and the date of posting the preceding evening.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46269' title='46269'>'Who knew that you were going to the Northumberland Hotel?' asked Holmes, glancing keenly, across at our visitor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46270' title='46270'>'No one could have known. </span>
<span sid='46271' title='46271'>We only decided after I met Dr Mortimer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46272' title='46272'>'But Dr Mortimer was, no doubt, already stopping there?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46273' title='46273'>'No, I had been staying with a friend,' said the doctor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46274' title='46274'>'There was no possible indication that we intended to go to this hotel.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46275' title='46275'>'Hum! </span>
<span sid='46276' title='46276'>Someone seems to be very deeply interested in your movements.' </span>
<span sid='46277' title='46277'>Out of the envelope he took a half-sheet of foolscap paper folded into four. </span>
<span sid='46278' title='46278'>This he opened and spread flat upon the table. </span>
<span sid='46279' title='46279'>Across the middle of it a single sentence had been formed by the expedient of pasting printed words upon it. </span>
<span sid='46280' title='46280'>It ran: 'as you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.' </span>
<span sid='46281' title='46281'>The word 'moor' only was printed in ink.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46282' title='46282'>'Now,' said Sir Henry Baskerville, 'perhaps you will tell me, Mr Holmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and Who it is that takes so much interest in my affairs?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46283' title='46283'>'What do you make of it, Dr Mortimer? </span>
<span sid='46284' title='46284'>You must allow that there is nothing supernatural about this, at any rate?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46285' title='46285'>'No, sir, but it might very well come from someone who was convinced that the business is supernatural.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46286' title='46286'>'What business?' asked Sir Henry, sharply. </span>
<span sid='46287' title='46287'>'It seems to me that all you gentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own affairs.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46288' title='46288'>'You shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, Sir Henry. </span>
<span sid='46289' title='46289'>I promise you that,' said Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='46290' title='46290'>'We will confine ourselves for the present, with your permission, to this very interesting document, which must have been put together and posted yesterday evening. </span>
<span sid='46291' title='46291'>Have you yesterday's Times,? </span>
<span sid='46292' title='46292'>Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46293' title='46293'>'It is here in the corner.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46294' title='46294'>'Might I trouble you for it - the inside page, please, with the leading articles?' </span>
<span sid='46295' title='46295'>He glanced swiftly over it, running his eyes up and down the columns. </span>
<span sid='46296' title='46296'>'Capital article this on Free Trade.? </span>
<span sid='46297' title='46297'>Permit me to give you an extract from it. </span>
<span sid='46298' title='46298'>"You may be cajoled into imagining that your own special trade or your own industry will be encouraged by a protective tariff, but it stands to reason that such legislation must in the long run keep away wealth from the country, diminish the value of our imports, and lower the general conditions of life in this island." </span>
<span sid='46299' title='46299'>What do you think of that, Watson?' cried Holmes, in high glee, rubbing his hands together with satisfaction. </span>
<span sid='46300' title='46300'>'Don't you think that is an admirable sentiment?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46301' title='46301'>Dr Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professional interest, and Sir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark eyes upon me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46302' title='46302'>'I don't know much about the tariff and things of that kind,' said he, 'but it seems to me we've got a bit off the trail so far as that note is concerned.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46303' title='46303'>'On the contrary, I think we are particularly hot upon the trail, Sir Henry. </span>
<span sid='46304' title='46304'>Watson here knows more about my methods than you do, but I fear that even he has not quite grasped the significance of this sentence.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46305' title='46305'>'No, I confess that I see no connection.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46306' title='46306'>'And yet, my dear Watson, there is so very close a connection that the one is extracted out of the other. </span>
<span sid='46307' title='46307'>"You", "your", "your", "life", "reason" , "value", "keep away", "from the". </span>
<span sid='46308' title='46308'>Don't you see now whence these words have been taken?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46309' title='46309'>'By thunder, you're right! </span>
<span sid='46310' title='46310'>Well, if that isn't smart!' cried Sir Henry.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46311' title='46311'>'If any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that "keep away" and "from the" are cut out in one piece.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46312' title='46312'>'Well, now - so it is!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46313' title='46313'>'Really, Mr Holmes, this exceeds anything which I could have imagined,' said Dr Mortimer, gazing at my friend in amazement. </span>
<span sid='46314' title='46314'>'I could understand anyone saying that the words were from a newspaper, but that you should name which, and add that it came from the leading article, is really one of the most remarkable things which I have ever known. </span>
<span sid='46315' title='46315'>How did you do it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46316' title='46316'>'I presume, doctor, that you could tell the skull of a negro from that of an Esquimaux?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46317' title='46317'>'Most certainly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46318' title='46318'>'But how?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46319' title='46319'>'Because that is my special hobby. </span>
<span sid='46320' title='46320'>The differences are obvious. </span>
<span sid='46321' title='46321'>The supra-orbital crest, the facial angle, the maxillary curve, the-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46322' title='46322'>'But this is my special hobby, and the differences are equally obvious. </span>
<span sid='46323' title='46323'>There is as much difference to my eyes between the leaded bourgeois type of a Times article and the slovenly print of an evening halfpenny paper as there could be between your Negro and your Esquimaux. </span>
<span sid='46324' title='46324'>The detection of types is one of the most elementary branches of knowledge to the special expert in crime, though I confess that once when I was very young I confused the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Leeds&t=h'>Leeds</a> Mercury with <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the West&t=h'>the West</a>ern Morning News. </span>
<span sid='46325' title='46325'>But a Times leader is entirely distinctive, and these words could have been taken from nothing else. </span>
<span sid='46326' title='46326'>As it was done yesterday the strong probability was that we should find the words in yesterday's issue.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46327' title='46327'>'So far as I can follow you, then, Mr Holmes,' said Sir Henry Baskerville, 'someone cut out this message with a scissors-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46328' title='46328'>'Nail-scissors,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='46329' title='46329'>'You can see that it was a very short-bladed scissors, since the cutter had to take two snips over "keep away".'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46330' title='46330'>'That is so. </span>
<span sid='46331' title='46331'>Someone, then, cut out the message with a pair of short-bladed scissors, pasted it with paste-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46332' title='46332'>'Gum,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46333' title='46333'>'With gum on to the paper. </span>
<span sid='46334' title='46334'>But I want to know why the word "moor" should have been written?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46335' title='46335'>'Because he could not find it in print. </span>
<span sid='46336' title='46336'>The other words were all simple, and might be found in any issue, but "moor" would be less common.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46337' title='46337'>'Why, of course, that would explain it. </span>
<span sid='46338' title='46338'>Have you read anything else in this message, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46339' title='46339'>'There are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains have been taken to remove all clues. </span>
<span sid='46340' title='46340'>The address, you observe, is printed in rough characters. </span>
<span sid='46341' title='46341'>But The Times is a paper which is seldom found in any hands but those of the highly educated. </span>
<span sid='46342' title='46342'>We may take it, therefore, that the letter was composed by an educated man who wished to pose as an uneducated one, and his effort to conceal his own writing suggests that that writing might be known, or come to be known, by you. </span>
<span sid='46343' title='46343'>Again, you will observe that the words are not gummed on in an accurate line, but that some are much higher than others. </span>
<span sid='46344' title='46344'>"Life", for example, is quite out of its proper place. </span>
<span sid='46345' title='46345'>That may point to carelessness or it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter. </span>
<span sid='46346' title='46346'>On the whole I incline to the latter view, since the matter was evidently important, and it is unlikely that the composer of such a letter would be careless. </span>
<span sid='46347' title='46347'>If he were in a hurry it opens up the interesting question why he should be in a hurry, since any letter posted up to early morning would reach Sir Henry before he would leave his hotel. </span>
<span sid='46348' title='46348'>Did the composer fear an interruption - and from whom?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46349' title='46349'>'We are coming now rather into the region of guesswork,' said Dr Mortimer.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46350' title='46350'>'Say, rather, into the region where we balance probabilities and choose the most likely. </span>
<span sid='46351' title='46351'>It is the scientific use of the imagination, but we have always some material basis on which to start our speculations. </span>
<span sid='46352' title='46352'>Now, you would call it a guess, no doubt, but I am almost certain that this address has been written in an hotel.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46353' title='46353'>'How in the world can you say that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46354' title='46354'>'If you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and the ink have given the writer trouble. </span>
<span sid='46355' title='46355'>The pen has spluttered twice in a single word, and has run dry three times in a short address, showing that there was very little ink in the bottle. </span>
<span sid='46356' title='46356'>Now, a private pen or ink-bottle is seldom allowed to be in such a state, and the combination of the two must be quite rare. </span>
<span sid='46357' title='46357'>But you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen, where it is rare to get anything else. </span>
<span sid='46358' title='46358'>Yes, I have very little hesitation in saying that could we examine the waste-paper baskets of the hotels round <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Charing Cross&t=h'>Charing Cross</a> until we found the remains of the mutilated Times leader we could lay our hands straight upon the person who sent this singular message. </span>
<span sid='46359' title='46359'>Hullo! </span>
<span sid='46360' title='46360'>Hullo! </span>
<span sid='46361' title='46361'>What's this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46362' title='46362'>He was carefully examining the foolscap, upon which the words were pasted, holding it only an inch or two from his eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46363' title='46363'>'Well?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46364' title='46364'>'Nothing,' said he, throwing it down. </span>
<span sid='46365' title='46365'>'It is a blank half-sheet of paper, without even a watermark upon it. </span>
<span sid='46366' title='46366'>I think we have drawn as much as we can from this curious letter, and now, Sir Henry, has anything else of interest happened to you since you have been in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46367' title='46367'>'Why, no, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='46368' title='46368'>I think not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46369' title='46369'>'You have not observed anyone follow or watch you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46370' title='46370'>'I seem to have walked right into the thick of a dime novel,'? said our visitor. </span>
<span sid='46371' title='46371'>'Why in thunder should anyone follow or watch me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46372' title='46372'>'We are coming to that. </span>
<span sid='46373' title='46373'>You have nothing else to report to us before we go into this matter?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46374' title='46374'>'Well, it depends upon what you think worth reporting.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46375' title='46375'>'I think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth reporting.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46376' title='46376'>Sir Henry smiled. </span>
<span sid='46377' title='46377'>'I don't know much of British life yet, for I have spent nearly all my time in the States and in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Canada&t=h'>Canada</a>. </span>
<span sid='46378' title='46378'>But I hope that to lose one of your boots is not part of the ordinary routine of life over here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46379' title='46379'>'You have lost one of your boots?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46380' title='46380'>'My dear sir,' cried Dr Mortimer, 'it is only mislaid. </span>
<span sid='46381' title='46381'>You will find it when you return to the hotel. </span>
<span sid='46382' title='46382'>What is the use of troubling Mr Holmes with trifles of this kind?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46383' title='46383'>'Well, he asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46384' title='46384'>'Exactly,' said Holmes, 'however foolish the incident may seem. </span>
<span sid='46385' title='46385'>You have lost one of your boots, you say?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46386' title='46386'>'Well, mislaid it, anyhow. </span>
<span sid='46387' title='46387'>I put them both outside my door last night, and there was only one in the morning. </span>
<span sid='46388' title='46388'>I could get no sense out of the chap who cleans them. </span>
<span sid='46389' title='46389'>The worst of it is that I only bought the pair last night in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Strand&t=h'>the Strand</a>, and I have never had them on.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46390' title='46390'>'If you have never worn them, why did you put them out to be cleaned?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46391' title='46391'>'They were tan boots, and had never been varnished. </span>
<span sid='46392' title='46392'>That was why I put them out.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46393' title='46393'>'Then I understand that on your arrival in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> yesterday you went out at once and bought a pair of boots?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46394' title='46394'>'I did a good deal of shopping. </span>
<span sid='46395' title='46395'>Dr Mortimer here went round with me. </span>
<span sid='46396' title='46396'>You see, if I am to be squire down there I must dress the part, and it may be that I have got a little careless in my ways out West. </span>
<span sid='46397' title='46397'>Among other things I bought these brown boots - gave six dollars for them and had one stolen before ever I had them on my feet.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46398' title='46398'>'It seems a singularly useless thing to steal,' said Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='46399' title='46399'>'I confess that I share Dr Mortimer's belief that it will not be long before the missing boot is found.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46400' title='46400'>'And now, gentlemen,' said the Baronet, with decision, 'it seems to me that I have spoken quite enough about the little that I know. </span>
<span sid='46401' title='46401'>It is time that you kept your promise, and gave me a full account of what we are all driving at.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46402' title='46402'>'Your request is a very reasonable one,' Holmes answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46403' title='46403'>'Dr Mortimer, I think you could not do better than to tell your story as you told it to us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46404' title='46404'>Thus encouraged, our scientific friend drew his papers from his pocket, and presented the whole case as he had done upon the morning before. </span>
<span sid='46405' title='46405'>Sir Henry Baskerville listened with the deepest attention and with an occasional exclamation of surprise.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46406' title='46406'>'Well, I seem to have come into an inheritance with a vengeance,' said he, when the long narrative was finished. </span>
<span sid='46407' title='46407'>'Of course, I've heard of the hound ever since I was in the nursery. </span>
<span sid='46408' title='46408'>It's the pet story of the family, though I never thought of taking it seriously before. </span>
<span sid='46409' title='46409'>But as to my uncle's death - well, it all seems boiling up in my head, and I can't get it clear yet. </span>
<span sid='46410' title='46410'>You don't seem quite to have made up your mind whether it's a case for a policeman or a clergyman.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46411' title='46411'>'Precisely.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46412' title='46412'>'And now there's this affair of the letter to me at the hotel. </span>
<span sid='46413' title='46413'>I suppose that fits into its place.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46414' title='46414'>'It seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what goes on upon the moor,' said Dr Mortimer.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46415' title='46415'>'And also,' said Holmes, 'that someone is not ill-disposed towards you, since they warn you of danger.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46416' title='46416'>'Or it may be that they wish for their own purposes to scare me away.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46417' title='46417'>'Well, of course, that is possible also. </span>
<span sid='46418' title='46418'>I am very much indebted to you, Dr Mortimer, for introducing me to a problem which presents several interesting alternatives. </span>
<span sid='46419' title='46419'>But the practical point which we now have to decide, Sir Henry, is whether it is or is not advisable for you to go to Baskerville Hall.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46420' title='46420'>'Why should I not go?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46421' title='46421'>'There seems to be danger.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46422' title='46422'>'Do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger from human beings?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46423' title='46423'>'Well, that is what we have to find out.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46424' title='46424'>'Whichever it is, my answer is fixed. </span>
<span sid='46425' title='46425'>There is no devil in hell, Mr Holmes, and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me from going to the home of my own people, and you may take that to be my final answer.' </span>
<span sid='46426' title='46426'>His dark brows knitted and his face flushed to a dusky red as he spoke. </span>
<span sid='46427' title='46427'>It was evident that the fiery temper of the Baskervilles was not extinct in this their last representative. </span>
<span sid='46428' title='46428'>'Meanwhile,' said he, 'I have hardly had time to think over all that you have told me. </span>
<span sid='46429' title='46429'>It's a big thing for a man to have to understand and to decide at one sitting. </span>
<span sid='46430' title='46430'>I should like to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind. </span>
<span sid='46431' title='46431'>Now, look here, Mr Holmes, it's half-past eleven now, and I am going back right away to my hotel. </span>
<span sid='46432' title='46432'>Suppose you and your friend, Dr Watson, come round and lunch with us at two? </span>
<span sid='46433' title='46433'>I'll be able to tell you more clearly then how this thing strikes me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46434' title='46434'>'Is that convenient to you, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46435' title='46435'>'Perfectly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46436' title='46436'>'Then you may expect us. </span>
<span sid='46437' title='46437'>Shall I have a cab called?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46438' title='46438'>'I'd prefer to walk, for this affair has flurried me rather.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46439' title='46439'>'I'll join you in a walk, with pleasure,' said his companion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46440' title='46440'>'Then we meet again at two o'clock. </span>
<span sid='46441' title='46441'>Au revoir, and good morning!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46442' title='46442'>We heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang of the front door. </span>
<span sid='46443' title='46443'>In an instant Holmes had changed from the languid dreamer to the man of action. </span>
<span sid='46444' title='46444'>'Your hat and boots, Watson, quick! </span>
<span sid='46445' title='46445'>Not a moment to lose!' </span>
<span sid='46446' title='46446'>He rushed into his room in his dressing-gown, and was back again in a few seconds in a frock-coat. </span>
<span sid='46447' title='46447'>We hurried together down the stairs and into the street. </span>
<span sid='46448' title='46448'>Dr Mortimer and Baskerville were still visible about two hundred yards ahead of us in the direction of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Oxford Street&t=h'>Oxford Street</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46449' title='46449'>'Shall I run on and stop them?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46450' title='46450'>'Not for the world, my dear Watson. </span>
<span sid='46451' title='46451'>I am perfectly satisfied with your company, if you will tolerate mine. </span>
<span sid='46452' title='46452'>Our friends are wise, for it is certainly a very fine morning for a walk.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46453' title='46453'>He quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which divided us by about half. </span>
<span sid='46454' title='46454'>Then, still keeping a hundred yards behind, we followed into <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Oxford Street&t=h'>Oxford Street</a> and so down <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Regent Street&t=h'>Regent Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='46455' title='46455'>Once our friends stopped and stared into a shop window, upon which Holmes did the same. </span>
<span sid='46456' title='46456'>An instant afterwards he gave a little cry of satisfaction, and, following the direction of his eager eyes, I saw that a hansom cab with a man inside which had halted on the other side of the street was now walking slowly onwards again.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46457' title='46457'>'There's our man, Watson! </span>
<span sid='46458' title='46458'>Come along! </span>
<span sid='46459' title='46459'>We'll have a good look at him, if we can do no more.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46460' title='46460'>At that instant I was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab. </span>
<span sid='46461' title='46461'>Instantly the trap-door at the top flew up, something was screamed to the driver, and the cab flew madly off down <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Regent Street&t=h'>Regent Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='46462' title='46462'>Holmes looked eagerly round for another, but no empty one was in sight. </span>
<span sid='46463' title='46463'>Then he dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream of the traffic, but the start was too great, and already the cab was out of sight.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46464' title='46464'>'There now!' said Holmes, bitterly, as he emerged panting and white with vexation from the tide of vehicles. </span>
<span sid='46465' title='46465'>'Was ever such bad luck and such bad management, too? </span>
<span sid='46466' title='46466'>Watson, Watson, if you are an honest man you will record this also and set it against my successes!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46467' title='46467'>'Who was the man?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46468' title='46468'>'I have not an idea.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46469' title='46469'>'A spy?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46470' title='46470'>'Well, it was evident from what we have heard that Baskerville has been very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in town. </span>
<span sid='46471' title='46471'>How else could it be known so quickly that it was the Northumberland Hotel which he had chosen? </span>
<span sid='46472' title='46472'>If they had followed him the first day I argued that they would follow him also the second. </span>
<span sid='46473' title='46473'>You may have observed that I twice strolled over to the window while Dr Mortimer was reading his legend.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46474' title='46474'>'Yes, I remember.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46475' title='46475'>'I was looking out for loiterers in the street, but I saw none. </span>
<span sid='46476' title='46476'>We are dealing with a clever man, Watson. </span>
<span sid='46477' title='46477'>This matter cuts very deep, and though I have not finally made up my mind whether it is a benevolent or a malevolent agency which is in touch with us, I am conscious always of power and design. </span>
<span sid='46478' title='46478'>When our friends left I at once followed them in the hopes of marking down their invisible attendant. </span>
<span sid='46479' title='46479'>So wily was he that he had not trusted himself upon foot, but he had availed himself of a cab, so that he could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their notice. </span>
<span sid='46480' title='46480'>His method had the additional advantage that if they were to take a cab he was all ready to follow them. </span>
<span sid='46481' title='46481'>It has, however, one obvious disadvantage.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46482' title='46482'>'It puts him in the power of the cabman.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46483' title='46483'>'Exactly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46484' title='46484'>'What a pity we did not get the number!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46485' title='46485'>'My dear Watson, clumsy as I have been, you surely do not seriously imagine that I neglected to get the number? </span>
<span sid='46486' title='46486'>2704 is our man. </span>
<span sid='46487' title='46487'>But that is no use to us for the moment.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46488' title='46488'>'I fail to see how you could have done more.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46489' title='46489'>'On observing the cab I should have instantly turned and walked in the other direction. </span>
<span sid='46490' title='46490'>I should then at my leisure have hired a second cab and followed the first at a respectful distance, or, better still, have driven to the Northumberland Hotel and waited there. </span>
<span sid='46491' title='46491'>When our unknown had followed Baskerville home we should have had the opportunity of playing his own game upon himself, and seeing where he made for. </span>
<span sid='46492' title='46492'>As it is, by an indiscreet eagerness, which was taken advantage of with extraordinary quickness and energy by our opponent, we have betrayed ourselves and lost our man.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46493' title='46493'>We had been sauntering slowly down <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Regent Street&t=h'>Regent Street</a> during this conversation, and Dr Mortimer, with his companion, had long vanished in front of us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46494' title='46494'>'There is no object in our following them,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='46495' title='46495'>'The shadow has departed and will not return. </span>
<span sid='46496' title='46496'>We must see what further cards we have in our hands, and play them with decision. </span>
<span sid='46497' title='46497'>Could you swear to that man's face, within the cab?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46498' title='46498'>'I could swear only to the beard.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46499' title='46499'>'And so could I - from which I gather that in all probability it was a false one. </span>
<span sid='46500' title='46500'>A clever man upon so delicate an errand has no use for a beard save to conceal his features. </span>
<span sid='46501' title='46501'>Come in here, Watson!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46502' title='46502'>He turned into one of the district messenger offices,? </span>
<span sid='46503' title='46503'>where he was warmly greeted by the manager.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46504' title='46504'>'Ah, Wilson, I see you have not forgotten the little case in which I had the good fortune to help you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46505' title='46505'>'No, sir, indeed I have not. </span>
<span sid='46506' title='46506'>You saved my good name, and perhaps my life.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46507' title='46507'>'My dear fellow, you exaggerate. </span>
<span sid='46508' title='46508'>I have some recollection, Wilson, that you had among your boys a lad named Cartwright,? </span>
<span sid='46509' title='46509'>who showed some ability during the investigation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46510' title='46510'>'Yes, sir, he is still with us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46511' title='46511'>'Could you ring him up? </span>
<span sid='46512' title='46512'>Thank you! </span>
<span sid='46513' title='46513'>And I should be glad to have change of this five-pound note.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46514' title='46514'>A lad of fourteen, with a bright, keen face, had obeyed the summons of the manager. </span>
<span sid='46515' title='46515'>He stood now gazing with great reverence at the famous detective.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46516' title='46516'>'Let me have the Hotel Directory,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='46517' title='46517'>'Thank you! </span>
<span sid='46518' title='46518'>Now, Cartwright, there are the names of twenty-three hotels here, all in the immediate neighbourhood of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Charing Cross&t=h'>Charing Cross</a>. </span>
<span sid='46519' title='46519'>Do you see?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46520' title='46520'>'Yes, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46521' title='46521'>'You will visit each of these in turn.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46522' title='46522'>'Yes, Sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46523' title='46523'>'You will begin in each case by giving the outside porter one shilling. </span>
<span sid='46524' title='46524'>Here are twenty-three shillings.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46525' title='46525'>'Yes, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46526' title='46526'>'You will tell him that you want to see the waste paper of yesterday. </span>
<span sid='46527' title='46527'>You will say that an important telegram has miscarried, and that you are looking for it. </span>
<span sid='46528' title='46528'>You understand?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46529' title='46529'>'Yes, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46530' title='46530'>'But what you are really looking for is the centre page of The Times with some holes cut in it with scissors. </span>
<span sid='46531' title='46531'>Here is a copy of The Times. </span>
<span sid='46532' title='46532'>It is this page. </span>
<span sid='46533' title='46533'>You could easily recognize it, could you not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46534' title='46534'>'Yes, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46535' title='46535'>'In each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter, to whom also you will give a shilling. </span>
<span sid='46536' title='46536'>Here are twenty-three shillings. </span>
<span sid='46537' title='46537'>You will then learn in possibly twenty cases out of the twenty-three that the waste of the day before has been burned or removed. </span>
<span sid='46538' title='46538'>In the three other cases you will be shown a heap of paper, and will look for this page of The Times among it. </span>
<span sid='46539' title='46539'>The odds are enormously against your finding it. </span>
<span sid='46540' title='46540'>There are ten shillings over in case of emergencies. </span>
<span sid='46541' title='46541'>Let me have a report by wire at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> before evening. </span>
<span sid='46542' title='46542'>And now, Watson, it only remains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman, No. 2704, and then we will drop into one of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bond Street&t=h'>Bond Street</a> picture galleries and fill in the time until we are due at the hotel.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46543' title='46543'>CHAPTER 5 : Three Broken Threads</span>
<p>
<span sid='46544' title='46544'>Sherlock Holmes had, in a very remarkable degree, the power of detaching his mind at will. </span>
<span sid='46545' title='46545'>For two hours the strange business in which we had been involved appeared to be forgotten, and he was entirely absorbed in the pictures of the modern Belgian masters. </span>
<span sid='46546' title='46546'>He would talk of nothing but art, of which he had the crudest ideas, from our leaving the gallery until we found ourselves at the Northumberland Hotel.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46547' title='46547'>'Sir Henry Baskerville is upstairs expecting you,' said the clerk. </span>
<span sid='46548' title='46548'>'He asked me to show you up at once when you came.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46549' title='46549'>'Have you any objection to my looking at your register?' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46550' title='46550'>'Not in the least.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46551' title='46551'>The book showed that two names had been added after that of Baskerville. </span>
<span sid='46552' title='46552'>One was Theophilus Johnson and family, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Newcastle&t=h'>Newcastle</a>, the other Mrs Oldmore and maid, of High Lodge, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Alton&t=h'>Alton</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46553' title='46553'>'Surely that must be the same Johnson whom I used to know,' said Holmes to the porter. </span>
<span sid='46554' title='46554'>'A lawyer, is he not, grey-headed, and walks with a limp?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46555' title='46555'>'No, sir, this is Mr Johnson the coal-owner, a very active gentleman, not older than yourself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46556' title='46556'>'Surely you are mistaken about his trade?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46557' title='46557'>'No, sir, he has used this hotel for many years, and he is very well known to us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46558' title='46558'>'Ah, that settles it. </span>
<span sid='46559' title='46559'>Mrs Oldmore, too, I seem to remember the name. </span>
<span sid='46560' title='46560'>Excuse my curiosity, but often in calling upon one friend one finds another.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46561' title='46561'>'She is an invalid lady, sir. </span>
<span sid='46562' title='46562'>Her husband was once Mayor of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Gloucester&t=h'>Gloucester</a>. </span>
<span sid='46563' title='46563'>She always comes to us when she is in town.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46564' title='46564'>'Thank you, I am afraid I cannot claim her acquaintance. </span>
<span sid='46565' title='46565'>We have established a most important fact by these questions, Watson,' he continued, in a low voice, as we went upstairs together. </span>
<span sid='46566' title='46566'>'We know now that the people who are so interested in our friend have not settled down in his own hotel. </span>
<span sid='46567' title='46567'>That means that while they are, as we have seen, very anxious to watch him, they are equally anxious that he should not see them. </span>
<span sid='46568' title='46568'>Now, this is a most suggestive fact.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46569' title='46569'>'What does it suggest?</span>
<p>
<span sid='46570' title='46570'>'It suggests - hullo, my dear fellow, what on earth is the matter?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46571' title='46571'>As we came round the top of the stairs we had run up against Sir Henry Baskerville himself. </span>
<span sid='46572' title='46572'>His face was flushed with anger, and he held an old and dusty boot in one of his hands. </span>
<span sid='46573' title='46573'>So furious was he that he was hardly articulate, and when he did speak it was in a much broader and more Western dialect than any which we had heard from him in the morning.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46574' title='46574'>'Seems to me they are playing me for a sucker in this hotel,' he cried. </span>
<span sid='46575' title='46575'>'They'll find they've started in to monkey with the wrong man unless they are careful. </span>
<span sid='46576' title='46576'>By thunder, if that chap can't find my missing boot there will be trouble. </span>
<span sid='46577' title='46577'>I can take a joke with the best, Mr Holmes, but they've got a bit over the mark this time.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46578' title='46578'>'Still looking for your boot?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46579' title='46579'>'Yes, sir, and mean to find it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46580' title='46580'>'But surely, you said that it was a new brown boot?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46581' title='46581'>'So it was, sir. </span>
<span sid='46582' title='46582'>And now it's an old black one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46583' title='46583'>'What! you don't mean to say-?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46584' title='46584'>'That's just what I do mean to say. </span>
<span sid='46585' title='46585'>I only had three pairs in the world - the new brown, the old black, and the patent leathers, which I am wearing. </span>
<span sid='46586' title='46586'>Last night they took one of my brown ones, and to-day they have sneaked one of the black. </span>
<span sid='46587' title='46587'>Well, have you got it? </span>
<span sid='46588' title='46588'>Speak out, man, and don't stand staring!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46589' title='46589'>An agitated German waiter had appeared upon the scene.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46590' title='46590'>'No, sir, I have made inquiry all over the hotel, but I can hear no word of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46591' title='46591'>'Well, either that boot comes back before sundown or I'll see the manager and tell him that I go right straight out of this hotel.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46592' title='46592'>'It shall be found, sir - I promise you that if you will have a little patience it will be found.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46593' title='46593'>'Mind it is, for it's the last thing of mine that I'll lose in this den of thieves. </span>
<span sid='46594' title='46594'>Well, well, Mr Holmes, you'll excuse my troubling you about such a trifle-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46595' title='46595'>'I think it's well worth troubling about.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46596' title='46596'>'Why, you look very serious over it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46597' title='46597'>'How do you explain it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46598' title='46598'>'I just don't attempt to explain it. </span>
<span sid='46599' title='46599'>It seems the very maddest, queerest thing that ever happened to me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46600' title='46600'>'The queerest, perhaps,' said Holmes, thoughtfully.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46601' title='46601'>'What do you make of it yourself ?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46602' title='46602'>'Well, I don't profess to understand it yet. </span>
<span sid='46603' title='46603'>This case of yours is very complex, Sir Henry. </span>
<span sid='46604' title='46604'>When taken in conjunction with your uncle's death I am not sure that of all the five hundred cases of capital importance which I have handled there is one which cuts so deep. </span>
<span sid='46605' title='46605'>But we hold several threads in our hands, and the odds are that one or other of them guides us to the truth. </span>
<span sid='46606' title='46606'>We may waste time in following the wrong one, but sooner or later we must come upon the right.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46607' title='46607'>We had a pleasant luncheon in which little was said of the business which had brought us together. </span>
<span sid='46608' title='46608'>It was in the private sitting-room to which we afterwards repaired that Holmes asked Baskerville what were his intentions.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46609' title='46609'>'To go to Baskerville Hall.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46610' title='46610'>'And when?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46611' title='46611'>'At the end of the week.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46612' title='46612'>'On the whole,' said Holmes, 'I think that your decision is a wise one. </span>
<span sid='46613' title='46613'>I have ample evidence that you are being dogged in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, and amid the millions of this great city it is difficult to discover who these people are or what their object can be. </span>
<span sid='46614' title='46614'>If their intentions are evil they might do you a mischief, and we should be powerless to prevent it. </span>
<span sid='46615' title='46615'>You did not know, Dr Mortimer, that you were followed this morning from my house?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46616' title='46616'>Dr Mortimer started violently. </span>
<span sid='46617' title='46617'>'Followed! </span>
<span sid='46618' title='46618'>By whom?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46619' title='46619'>'That, unfortunately, is what I cannot tell you. </span>
<span sid='46620' title='46620'>Have you among your neighbours or acquaintances on <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Dartmoor&t=h'>Dartmoor</a> any man with a black, full beard?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46621' title='46621'>'No - or, let me see - why, yes. </span>
<span sid='46622' title='46622'>Barrymore, Sir Charles's butler, is a man with a full, black beard.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46623' title='46623'>'Ha! </span>
<span sid='46624' title='46624'>Where is Barrymore?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46625' title='46625'>'He is in charge of the Hall.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46626' title='46626'>'We had best ascertain if he is really there, or if by any possibility he might be in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46627' title='46627'>'How can you do that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46628' title='46628'>'Give me a telegraph form. </span>
<span sid='46629' title='46629'>"Is all ready for Sir Henry?" </span>
<span sid='46630' title='46630'>That will do. </span>
<span sid='46631' title='46631'>Address to Mr Barrymore, Baskerville Hall. </span>
<span sid='46632' title='46632'>Which is the nearest telegraph-office? </span>
<span sid='46633' title='46633'>Grimpen. </span>
<span sid='46634' title='46634'>Very good, we will send a second wire to the postmaster, Grimpen: </span>
<span sid='46635' title='46635'>"Telegram to Mr Barrymore, to be delivered into his own hand. </span>
<span sid='46636' title='46636'>If absent, please return wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel." </span>
<span sid='46637' title='46637'>That should let us know before evening whether Barrymore is at his post in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Devonshire&t=h'>Devonshire</a> or not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46638' title='46638'>'That's so,' said Baskerville. </span>
<span sid='46639' title='46639'>'By the way, Dr Mortimer, who is this Barrymore, anyhow?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46640' title='46640'>'He is the son of the old caretaker, who is dead. </span>
<span sid='46641' title='46641'>They have looked after the Hall for four generations now. </span>
<span sid='46642' title='46642'>So far as I know, he and his wife are as respectable a couple as any in the county.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46643' title='46643'>'At the same time,' said Baskerville, 'it's clear enough that so long as there are none of the family at the Hall these people have a mighty fine home and nothing to do.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46644' title='46644'>'That is true.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46645' title='46645'>'Did Barrymore profit at all by Sir Charles's will?' asked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46646' title='46646'>'He and his wife had five hundred pounds each.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46647' title='46647'>'Ha! </span>
<span sid='46648' title='46648'>Did they know that they would receive this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46649' title='46649'>'Yes, Sir Charles was very fond of talking about the provisions of his will.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46650' title='46650'>'That is very interesting.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46651' title='46651'>'I hope', said Dr Mortimer, 'that you do not look with suspicious eyes upon everyone who received a legacy from Sir Charles, for I also had a thousand pounds left to me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46652' title='46652'>'Indeed! </span>
<span sid='46653' title='46653'>And anyone else?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46654' title='46654'>'There were many insignificant sums to individuals and a large number of public charities. </span>
<span sid='46655' title='46655'>The residue all went to Sir Henry.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46656' title='46656'>'And how much was the residue?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46657' title='46657'>'Seven hundred and forty thousand pounds.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46658' title='46658'>Holmes raised his eyebrows in surprise. </span>
<span sid='46659' title='46659'>'I had no idea that so gigantic a sum was involved,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46660' title='46660'>'Sir Charles had the reputation of being rich, but we did not know how very rich he was until we came to examine his securities. </span>
<span sid='46661' title='46661'>The total value of the estate was close on to a million.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46662' title='46662'>'Dear me! </span>
<span sid='46663' title='46663'>It is a stake for which a man might well play a desperate game. </span>
<span sid='46664' title='46664'>And one more question, Dr Mortimer. </span>
<span sid='46665' title='46665'>Supposing that anything happened to our young friend here - you will forgive the unpleasant hypothesis! - who would inherit the estate?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46666' title='46666'>'Since Rodger Baskerville, Sir Charles's younger brother, died unmarried, the estate would descend to the Desmonds, who are distant cousins. </span>
<span sid='46667' title='46667'>James Desmond is an elderly clergyman in Westmorland.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46668' title='46668'>'Thank you. </span>
<span sid='46669' title='46669'>These details are all of great interest. </span>
<span sid='46670' title='46670'>Have you met Mr James Desmond?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46671' title='46671'>'Yes, he once came down to visit Sir Charles. </span>
<span sid='46672' title='46672'>He is a man of venerable appearance and of saintly life. </span>
<span sid='46673' title='46673'>I remember that he refused to accept any settlement from Sir Charles, though he pressed it upon him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46674' title='46674'>'And this man of simple tastes would be the heir to Sir Charles's thousands?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46675' title='46675'>'He would be the heir to the estate, because that is entailed. </span>
<span sid='46676' title='46676'>He would also be the heir to the money unless it were willed otherwise by the present owner, who can, of course, do what he likes with it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46677' title='46677'>'And have you made your will, Sir Henry?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46678' title='46678'>'No, Mr Holmes, I have not. </span>
<span sid='46679' title='46679'>I've had no time, for it was only yesterday that I learned how matters stood. </span>
<span sid='46680' title='46680'>But in any case I feel that the money should go with the title and estate. </span>
<span sid='46681' title='46681'>That was my poor uncle's idea. </span>
<span sid='46682' title='46682'>How is the owner going to restore the glories of the Baskervilles if he has not money enough to keep up the property? </span>
<span sid='46683' title='46683'>House, land, and dollars must go together.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46684' title='46684'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='46685' title='46685'>Well, Sir Henry, I am of one mind with you as to the advisability of your going down to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Devonshire&t=h'>Devonshire</a> without delay. </span>
<span sid='46686' title='46686'>There is only one provision which I must make. </span>
<span sid='46687' title='46687'>You certainly must not go alone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46688' title='46688'>'Dr Mortimer returns with me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46689' title='46689'>'But Dr Mortimer has his practice to attend to, and his house is miles away from yours. </span>
<span sid='46690' title='46690'>With all the good will in the world, he may be unable to help you. </span>
<span sid='46691' title='46691'>No, Sir Henry, you must take with you someone, a trusty man, who will be always by your side.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46692' title='46692'>'Is it possible that you could come yourself, Mr Holmes?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='46693' title='46693'>'If matters came to a crisis I should endeavour to be present in person, but you can understand that, with my extensive consulting practice and with the constant appeals which reach me from many quarters, it is impossible for me to be absent from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> for an indefinite time. </span>
<span sid='46694' title='46694'>At the present instant one of the most revered names in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> is being besmirched by a blackmailer, and only I can stop a disastrous scandal. </span>
<span sid='46695' title='46695'>You will see how impossible it is for me to go to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Dartmoor&t=h'>Dartmoor</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46696' title='46696'>'Whom would you recommend, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46697' title='46697'>Holmes laid his hand upon my arm.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46698' title='46698'>'If my friend would undertake it there is no man who is better worth having at your side when you are in a tight place. </span>
<span sid='46699' title='46699'>No one can say so more confidently than I.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46700' title='46700'>The proposition took me completely by surprise, but before I had time to answer Baskerville seized me by the hand and wrung it heartily.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46701' title='46701'>'Well, now, that is real kind of you, Dr Watson,' said he. </span>
<span sid='46702' title='46702'>'You see how it is with me, and you know just as much about the matter as I do. </span>
<span sid='46703' title='46703'>If you will come down to Baskerville Hall and see me through I'll never forget it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46704' title='46704'>The promise of adventure had always a fascination for me, and I was complimented by the words of Holmes and by the eagerness with which the Baronet hailed me as a companion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46705' title='46705'>'I will come with pleasure,' said I. </span>
<span sid='46706' title='46706'>'I do not know how I could employ my time better.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46707' title='46707'>'And you will report very carefully to me,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='46708' title='46708'>'When a crisis comes, as it will do, I will direct how you shall act. </span>
<span sid='46709' title='46709'>I suppose that by Saturday all might be ready?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46710' title='46710'>'Would that suit Dr Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46711' title='46711'>'Perfectly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46712' title='46712'>'Then on Saturday, unless you hear to the contrary, we shall meet at the 10.30 train from Paddington.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46713' title='46713'>We had risen to depart when Baskerville gave a cry of triumph, and diving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown boot from under a cabinet.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46714' title='46714'>'My missing boott!' he cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46715' title='46715'>'May all our difficulties vanish as easily!' said Sherlock Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46716' title='46716'>'But it is a very singular thing,' Dr Mortimer remarked. </span>
<span sid='46717' title='46717'>'I searched this room carefully before lunch.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46718' title='46718'>'And so did I,' said Baskerville. </span>
<span sid='46719' title='46719'>'Every inch of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46720' title='46720'>'There was certainly no boot in it then.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46721' title='46721'>'In that case the waiter must have placed it there while we were lunching.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46722' title='46722'>The German was sent for, but professed to know nothing of the matter, nor could any inquiry clear it up. </span>
<span sid='46723' title='46723'>Another item had been added to that constant and apparently purposeless series of small mysteries which had succeeded each other so rapidly. </span>
<span sid='46724' title='46724'>Setting aside the whole grim story of Sir Charles's death, we had a line of inexplicable incidents all within the limits of two days, which included the receipt of the printed letter, the black-bearded spy in the hansom, the loss of the new brown boot, the loss of the old black boot, and now the return of the new brown boot. </span>
<span sid='46725' title='46725'>Holmes sat in silence in the cab as we drove back to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>, and I knew from his drawn brows and keen face that his mind, like my own, was busy in endeavouring to frame some scheme into which all these strange and apparently disconnected episodes could be fitted. </span>
<span sid='46726' title='46726'>All afternoon and late into the evening he sat lost in tobacco and thought.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46727' title='46727'>Just before dinner two telegrams were handed in. </span>
<span sid='46728' title='46728'>The first ran:</span>
<p>
<span sid='46729' title='46729'>Have just heard that Barrymore is at the Hall </span>
<span sid='46730' title='46730'>- BASKERVILLE.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46731' title='46731'>The second:</span>
<p>
<span sid='46732' title='46732'>Visited twenty-three hotels as directed, but sorry to report unable to trace cut sheet of Times </span>
<span sid='46733' title='46733'>- CARTWRIGHT.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46734' title='46734'>'There go two of my threads, Watson. </span>
<span sid='46735' title='46735'>There is nothing more stimulating than a case where everything goes against you. </span>
<span sid='46736' title='46736'>We must cast round for another scent.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46737' title='46737'>'We have still the cabman who drove the spy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46738' title='46738'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='46739' title='46739'>I have wired to get his name and address from the Official Registry. </span>
<span sid='46740' title='46740'>I should not be surprised if this were an answer to my question.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46741' title='46741'>The ring at the bell proved to be something even more satisfactory than an answer, however, for the door opened and a rough-looking fellow entered who was evidently the man himself.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46742' title='46742'>'I got a message from the head office that a gent at this address had been inquiring for 2704,' said he. </span>
<span sid='46743' title='46743'>'I've driven my cab this seven years and never a word of complaint. </span>
<span sid='46744' title='46744'>I came here straight from the Yard to ask you to your face what you had against me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46745' title='46745'>'I have nothing in the world against you, nay good man,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='46746' title='46746'>'On the contrary, I have half a sovereign for you if you will give me a clear answer to my questions.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46747' title='46747'>'Well, I've had a good day and no mistake,' said the cabman, with a grin. </span>
<span sid='46748' title='46748'>'What was it you wanted to ask, sir?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46749' title='46749'>'First of all your name and address, in case I want you again.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46750' title='46750'>'John Clayton, 3, Turpey Street, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Borough&t=h'>the Borough</a>. </span>
<span sid='46751' title='46751'>My cab is out of Shipley's Yard, near <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Waterloo Station&t=h'>Waterloo Station</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46752' title='46752'>Sherlock Holmes made a note of it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46753' title='46753'>'Now, Clayton, tell me all about the fare who came and watched this house at ten o'clock this morning and afterwards followed the two gentlemen down <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Regent Street&t=h'>Regent Street</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46754' title='46754'>The man looked surprised and a little embarrassed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46755' title='46755'>'Why, there's no good my telling you things, for you seem to know as much as I do already,' said he. </span>
<span sid='46756' title='46756'>'The truth is that the gentleman told me that he was a detective, and that I was to say nothing about him to anyone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46757' title='46757'>'My good fellow, this is a very serious business, and you may find yourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide anything from me. </span>
<span sid='46758' title='46758'>You say that your fare told you that he was a detective?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46759' title='46759'>'Yes, he did.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46760' title='46760'>'When did he say this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46761' title='46761'>'When he left me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46762' title='46762'>'Did he say anything more?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46763' title='46763'>'He mentioned his name.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46764' title='46764'>Holmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46765' title='46765'>'Oh, he mentioned his name, did he? </span>
<span sid='46766' title='46766'>That was imprudent. </span>
<span sid='46767' title='46767'>What was the name that he mentioned?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46768' title='46768'>'His name', said the cabman, 'was Mr Sherlock Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46769' title='46769'>Never have I seen my friend more completely taken aback than by the cabman's reply. </span>
<span sid='46770' title='46770'>For an instant he sat in silent amazement. </span>
<span sid='46771' title='46771'>Then he burst into a hearty laugh.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46772' title='46772'>'A touch, Watson - an undeniable touch!' said he. </span>
<span sid='46773' title='46773'>'I feel a foil as quick and supple as my own. </span>
<span sid='46774' title='46774'>He got home upon me very prettily that time. </span>
<span sid='46775' title='46775'>So his name was Sherlock Holmes, was it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46776' title='46776'>'Yes, sir, that was the gentleman's name.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46777' title='46777'>'Excellent! </span>
<span sid='46778' title='46778'>Tell me where you picked him up and all that occurred.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46779' title='46779'>'He hailed me at half-past nine in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Trafalgar Square&t=h'>Trafalgar Square</a>. </span>
<span sid='46780' title='46780'>He said that he was a detective, and he offered me two guineas if I would do exactly what he wanted all day and ask no questions. </span>
<span sid='46781' title='46781'>I was glad enough to agree. </span>
<span sid='46782' title='46782'>First we drove down to the Northumberland Hotel and waited there until two gentlemen came out and took a cab from the rank. </span>
<span sid='46783' title='46783'>We followed their cab until it pulled up somewhere near here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46784' title='46784'>'This very door,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46785' title='46785'>'Well, I couldn't be sure of that, but I dare say my fare knew all about it. </span>
<span sid='46786' title='46786'>We pulled up half-way down the street and waited an hour and a half. </span>
<span sid='46787' title='46787'>Then the two gentlemen passed us, walking, and we followed down <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> and along-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46788' title='46788'>'I know,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46789' title='46789'>'Until we got three-quarters down <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Regent Street&t=h'>Regent Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='46790' title='46790'>Then my gentleman threw up the trap, and he cried that I should drive right away to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Waterloo Station&t=h'>Waterloo Station</a> as hard as I could go. </span>
<span sid='46791' title='46791'>I whipped up the mare and we were there under the ten minutes. </span>
<span sid='46792' title='46792'>Then he paid up his two guineas, like a good one, and away he went into the station. </span>
<span sid='46793' title='46793'>Only just as he was leaving he turned round and said: </span>
<span sid='46794' title='46794'>"It might interest you to know that you have been driving Mr Sherlock Holmes." </span>
<span sid='46795' title='46795'>That's how I came to know the name.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46796' title='46796'>'I see. </span>
<span sid='46797' title='46797'>And you saw no more of him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46798' title='46798'>'Not after he went into the station.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46799' title='46799'>'And how would you describe Mr Sherlock Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46800' title='46800'>The cabman scratched his head. </span>
<span sid='46801' title='46801'>'Well, he wasn't altogether such an easy gentleman to describe. </span>
<span sid='46802' title='46802'>I'd put him at forty years of age, and he was of a middle height, two or three inches shorter than you, sir. </span>
<span sid='46803' title='46803'>He was dressed like a toff, and he had a black beard, cut square at the end, and a pale face. </span>
<span sid='46804' title='46804'>I don't know as I could say more than that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46805' title='46805'>'Colour of his eyes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46806' title='46806'>'No, I can't say that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46807' title='46807'>'Nothing more that you can remember?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46808' title='46808'>'No, sir, nothing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46809' title='46809'>'Well, then, here is your half-sovereign. </span>
<span sid='46810' title='46810'>There's another one waiting for you if you can bring any more information. </span>
<span sid='46811' title='46811'>Good-night!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46812' title='46812'>'Good-night, sir, and thank you!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46813' title='46813'>John Clayton departed, chuckling, and Holmes turned to me with a shrug of the shoulders and a rueful smile.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46814' title='46814'>'Snap goes our third thread, and we end where we began,' said he. </span>
<span sid='46815' title='46815'>'The cunning rascal! </span>
<span sid='46816' title='46816'>He knew our number, knew that Sir Henry Baskerville had consulted me, spotted who I was in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Regent Street&t=h'>Regent Street</a>, conjectured that I had got the number of the cab and would lay my hands on the driver, and so sent back this audacious message. </span>
<span sid='46817' title='46817'>I tell you, Watson, this time we have got a foeman who is worthy of our steel. </span>
<span sid='46818' title='46818'>I've been checkmated in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='46819' title='46819'>I can only wish you better luck in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Devonshire&t=h'>Devonshire</a>. </span>
<span sid='46820' title='46820'>But I'm not easy in my mind about it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46821' title='46821'>'About what?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46822' title='46822'>'About sending you. </span>
<span sid='46823' title='46823'>It's an ugly business, Watson, an ugly, dangerous business, and the more I see of it the less I like it. </span>
<span sid='46824' title='46824'>Yes, my dear fellow, you may laugh, but I give you my word that I shall be very glad to have you back safe and sound in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> once more.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46825' title='46825'>CHAPTER 6 : Baskerville Hall</span>
<p>
<span sid='46826' title='46826'>Sir Henry Baskerville and Dr Mortimer were ready upon the appointed day, and we started as arranged for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Devonshire&t=h'>Devonshire</a>. </span>
<span sid='46827' title='46827'>Mr Sherlock Holmes drove with me to the station, and gave me his last parting injunctions and advice.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46828' title='46828'>'I will not bias your mind by suggesting theories or suspicions, Watson,' said he, 'I wish you simply to report facts in the fullest possible manner to me, and you can leave me to do the theorizing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46829' title='46829'>'What sort of facts?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46830' title='46830'>'Anything which may seem to have a bearing, however indirect, upon the case, and especially the relations between young Baskerville and his neighbours, or any fresh particulars concerning the death of Sir Charles. </span>
<span sid='46831' title='46831'>I have made some inquiries myself in the last few days, but the results have, I fear, been negative. </span>
<span sid='46832' title='46832'>One thing only appears to be certain, and that is that Mr James Desmond, who is the next heir, is an elderly gentleman of a very amiable disposition, so that this persecution does not arise from him. </span>
<span sid='46833' title='46833'>I really think that we may eliminate him entirely from our calculations. </span>
<span sid='46834' title='46834'>There remain the people who will actually surround Sir Henry Baskerville upon the moor.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46835' title='46835'>'Would it not be well in the first place to get rid of this Barrymore couple?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46836' title='46836'>'By no means. </span>
<span sid='46837' title='46837'>You could not make a greater mistake. </span>
<span sid='46838' title='46838'>If they are innocent it would be a cruel injustice, and if they are guilty we should be giving up all chance of bringing it home to them. </span>
<span sid='46839' title='46839'>No, no, we will preserve them upon our list of suspects. </span>
<span sid='46840' title='46840'>Then there is a groom at the Hall, if I remember right. </span>
<span sid='46841' title='46841'>There are two moorland farmers. </span>
<span sid='46842' title='46842'>There is our friend Dr Mortimer, whom I believe to be entirely honest, and there is his wife, of whom we know nothing. </span>
<span sid='46843' title='46843'>There is this naturalist Stapleton, and there is his sister, who is said to be a young lady of attractions. </span>
<span sid='46844' title='46844'>There is Mr Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who is also an unknown factor, and there are one or two other neighbours. </span>
<span sid='46845' title='46845'>These are the folk who must be your very special study.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46846' title='46846'>'I will do my best.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46847' title='46847'>'You have arms, I suppose?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46848' title='46848'>'Yes, I thought it as well to take them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46849' title='46849'>'Most certainly. </span>
<span sid='46850' title='46850'>Keep your revolver near you night and day, and never relax your precautions.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46851' title='46851'>Our friends had already secured a first-class carriage, and were waiting for us upon the platform.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46852' title='46852'>'No, we have no news of any kind,' said Dr Mortimer, in answer to my friend's questions. </span>
<span sid='46853' title='46853'>'I can swear to one thing, and that is that we have not been shadowed during the last two days. </span>
<span sid='46854' title='46854'>We have never gone out without keeping a sharp watch, and no one could have escaped our notice.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46855' title='46855'>'You have always kept together, I presume?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46856' title='46856'>'Except yesterday afternoon. </span>
<span sid='46857' title='46857'>I usually give up one day to pure amusement when I come to town, so I spent it at the Museum of the College of Surgeons.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46858' title='46858'>'And I went to look at the folk in the park,' said Baskerville. </span>
<span sid='46859' title='46859'>'But we had no trouble of any kind.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46860' title='46860'>'It was imprudent, all the same,' said Holmes, shaking his head and looking very grave. </span>
<span sid='46861' title='46861'>'I beg, Sir Henry, that you will not go about alone. </span>
<span sid='46862' title='46862'>Some great misfortune will befall you if you do. </span>
<span sid='46863' title='46863'>Did you get your other boot?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46864' title='46864'>'No, sir, it is gone for ever.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46865' title='46865'>'Indeed. </span>
<span sid='46866' title='46866'>That is very interesting. </span>
<span sid='46867' title='46867'>Well, good-bye,' he added, as the train began to glide down the platform. </span>
<span sid='46868' title='46868'>'Bear in mind, Sir Henry, one of the phrases in that queer old legend which Dr Mortimer has read to us, and avoid the moor in those hours of darkness when the powers of evil are exalted.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46869' title='46869'>I looked back at the platform when we had left it far behind, and saw the tall, austere figure of Holmes standing motionless and gazing after us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46870' title='46870'>The journey was a swift and pleasant one, and I spent it in making the more intimate acquaintance of my two companions, and in playing with Dr Mortimer's spaniel. </span>
<span sid='46871' title='46871'>In a very few hours the brown earth had become ruddy, the brick had changed to granite, and red cows grazed in well-hedged fields where the lush grasses and more luxuriant vegetation spoke of a richer, if a damper, climate. </span>
<span sid='46872' title='46872'>Young Baskerville stared eagerly out of the window, and cried aloud with delight as he recognized the familiar features of the Devon scenery.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46873' title='46873'>'I've been over a good part of the world since I left it, Dr Watson,' said he, 'but I have never seen a place to compare with it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46874' title='46874'>'I never saw a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Devonshire&t=h'>Devonshire</a> man who did not swear by his county,' I remarked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46875' title='46875'>'It depends upon the breed of men quite as much as on the county,' said Dr Mortimer. </span>
<span sid='46876' title='46876'>'A glance at our friend here reveals the rounded head of the Celt, which carries inside it the Celtic enthusiasm and power of attachment. </span>
<span sid='46877' title='46877'>Poor Sir Charles's head was of a very rare type, half Gaelic, half Ivernian in its characteristics. </span>
<span sid='46878' title='46878'>But you were very young when you last saw Baskerville Hall, were you not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46879' title='46879'>'I was a boy in my teens at the time of my father's death, and had never seen the Hall, for he lived in a little cottage on the south coast. </span>
<span sid='46880' title='46880'>Thence I went straight to a friend in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>. </span>
<span sid='46881' title='46881'>I tell you it is all as new to me as it is to Dr Watson, and I'm as keen as possible to see the moor.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46882' title='46882'>'Are you? </span>
<span sid='46883' title='46883'>Then your wish is easily granted, for there is your first sight of the moor,' said Dr Mortimer, pointing out of the carriage window.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46884' title='46884'>Over the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a wood there rose in the distance a grey, melancholy hill, with a strange jagged summit, dim and vague in the distance, like some fantastic landscape in a dream. </span>
<span sid='46885' title='46885'>Baskerville sat for a long time, his eyes fixed upon it, and I read upon his eager face how much it meant to him, this first sight of that strange spot where the men of his blood had held sway so long and left their mark so deep. </span>
<span sid='46886' title='46886'>There he sat, with his tweed suit and his <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n accent, in the corner of a prosaic railway-carriage, and yet as I looked at his dark and expressive face I felt more than ever how true a descendant he was of that long line of high-blooded, fiery, and masterful men. </span>
<span sid='46887' title='46887'>There were pride, valour, and strength in his thick brows, his sensitive nostrils, and his large hazel eyes. </span>
<span sid='46888' title='46888'>If on that forbidding moor a difficult and dangerous quest should lie before us, this was at least a comrade for whom one might venture to take a risk with the certainty that he would bravely share it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46889' title='46889'>The train pulled up at a small wayside station, and we all descended. </span>
<span sid='46890' title='46890'>Outside, beyond the low, white fence, a wagonette with a pair of cobs was waiting. </span>
<span sid='46891' title='46891'>Our coming was evidently a great event, for station-master and porters clustered round us to carry out our luggage. </span>
<span sid='46892' title='46892'>It was a sweet, simple country spot, but I was surprised to observe that by the gate there stood two soldierly men in dark uniforms, who leaned upon their short rifles and glanced keenly at us as we passed. </span>
<span sid='46893' title='46893'>The coachman, a hard-faced, gnarled little fellow, saluted Sir Henry Baskerville, and in a few minutes we were flying swiftly down the broad, white road. </span>
<span sid='46894' title='46894'>Rolling pasture lands curved upwards on either side of us, and old gabled houses peeped out from amid the thick green foliage, but behind the peaceful and sunlit country-side there rose ever, dark against the evening sky, the long, gloomy curve of the moor, broken by the jagged and sinister hills.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46895' title='46895'>The wagonette swung round into a side road, and we curved upwards through deep lanes worn by centuries of wheels, high banks on either side, heavy with dripping moss and fleshy harts-tongue ferns. </span>
<span sid='46896' title='46896'>Bronzing bracken and mottled bramble gleamed in the light of the sinking sun. </span>
<span sid='46897' title='46897'>Still steadily rising, we passed over a narrow granite bridge, and skirted a noisy stream, which gushed swiftly down, foaming and roaring amid the grey boulders. </span>
<span sid='46898' title='46898'>Both road and stream wound up through a valley dense with scrub oak and fir. </span>
<span sid='46899' title='46899'>At every turning Baskerville gave an exclamation of delight, looking eagerly about him and asking countless questions. </span>
<span sid='46900' title='46900'>To his eyes all seemed beautiful, but to me a tinge of melancholy lay upon the country-side, which bore so clearly the mark of the waning year. </span>
<span sid='46901' title='46901'>Yellow leaves carpeted the lanes and fluttered down upon us as we passed. </span>
<span sid='46902' title='46902'>The rattle of our wheels died away as we drove through drifts of rotting vegetation - sad gifts, as it seemed to me, for Nature to throw before the carriage of the returning heir of the Baskervilles.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46903' title='46903'>'Hullo!' cried Dr Mortimer, 'what is this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46904' title='46904'>A steep curve of heath-clad land, an outlying spur of the moor, lay in front of us. </span>
<span sid='46905' title='46905'>On the summit, hard and clear like an equestrian statue upon its pedestal, was a mounted soldier, dark and stern, his rifle poised ready over his forearm. </span>
<span sid='46906' title='46906'>He was watching the road along which, we travelled.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46907' title='46907'>'What is this, Perkins?' asked Dr Mortimer.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46908' title='46908'>Our driver half turned in his seat.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46909' title='46909'>'There's a convict escaped from Princetown, sir. </span>
<span sid='46910' title='46910'>He's been out three days now, and the warders watch every road and every station, but they've had no sight of him yet. </span>
<span sid='46911' title='46911'>The farmers about here don't like it, sir, and that's a fact.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46912' title='46912'>'Well, I understand that they get five pounds if they can give information.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46913' title='46913'>'Yes, sir, but the chance of five pounds is but a poor thing compared to the chance of having your throat cut. </span>
<span sid='46914' title='46914'>You see, it isn't like any ordinary convict. </span>
<span sid='46915' title='46915'>This is a man that would stick at nothing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46916' title='46916'>'Who is he, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46917' title='46917'>'It is Selden, the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Notting Hill&t=h'>Notting Hill</a> murderer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46918' title='46918'>I remembered the case well, for it was one in which Holmes had taken an interest on account of the peculiar ferocity of the crime and the wanton brutality which had marked all the actions of the assassin. </span>
<span sid='46919' title='46919'>The commutation of his death sentence had been due to some doubts as to his complete sanity, so atrocious was his conduct. </span>
<span sid='46920' title='46920'>Our wagonette had topped a rise and in front of us rose the huge expanse of the moor, mottled with gnarled and craggy cairns and tors. </span>
<span sid='46921' title='46921'>A cold wind swept down from it and set us shivering. </span>
<span sid='46922' title='46922'>Somewhere there, on that desolate plain, was lurking this fiendish man, hiding in a burrow like a wild beast, his heart full of malignancy against the whole race which had cast him out. </span>
<span sid='46923' title='46923'>It needed but this to complete the grim suggestiveness of the barren waste, the chilling wind, and the darkling sky. </span>
<span sid='46924' title='46924'>Even Baskerville fell silent and pulled his overcoat more closely around him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46925' title='46925'>We had left the fertile country behind and beneath us. </span>
<span sid='46926' title='46926'>We looked back on it now, the slanting rays of a low sun turning the streams to threads of gold and glowing on the red earth new turned by the plough and the broad tangle of the woodlands. </span>
<span sid='46927' title='46927'>The road in front of us grew bleaker and wilder over huge russet and olive slopes, sprinkled with giant boulders. </span>
<span sid='46928' title='46928'>Now and then we passed a moorland cottage, walled and roofed with stone, with no creeper to break its harsh outline. </span>
<span sid='46929' title='46929'>Suddenly we looked down into a cup-like depression, patched with stunted oaks and firs which had been twisted and bent by the fury of years of storm. </span>
<span sid='46930' title='46930'>Two high, narrow towers rose over the trees. </span>
<span sid='46931' title='46931'>The driver pointed with his whip.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46932' title='46932'>'Baskerville Hall,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46933' title='46933'>Its master had risen, and was staring with flushed cheeks and shining eyes. </span>
<span sid='46934' title='46934'>A few minutes later we had reached the lodge-gates, a maze of fantastic tracery in wrought iron, with weather-bitten pillars on either side, blotched with lichens, and surmounted by the boars' heads of the Baskervilles. </span>
<span sid='46935' title='46935'>The lodge was a ruin of black granite and bared ribs of rafters, but facing it was a new building, half constructed, the first fruit of Sir Charles's South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>n gold.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46936' title='46936'>Through the gateway we passed into the avenue, where the wheels were again hushed amid the leaves, and the old trees shot their branches in a sombre tunnel over our heads. </span>
<span sid='46937' title='46937'>Baskerville shuddered as he looked up the long, dark drive to where the house glimmered like a ghost at the farther end.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46938' title='46938'>'Was it here?' he asked, in a low voice.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46939' title='46939'>'No, no, the Yew Alley is on the other side.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46940' title='46940'>The young heir glanced round with a gloomy face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46941' title='46941'>'It's no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble were coming on him in such a place as this,' said he. </span>
<span sid='46942' title='46942'>'It's enough to scare any man. </span>
<span sid='46943' title='46943'>I'll have a row of electric lamps up here inside of six months, and you won't know it again with a thousand candle-power Swan and Edison right here in front of the hall door.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46944' title='46944'>The avenue opened into a broad expanse of turf, and the house lay before us. </span>
<span sid='46945' title='46945'>In the fading light I could see that the centre was a heavy block of building from which a porch projected. </span>
<span sid='46946' title='46946'>The whole front was draped in ivy, with a patch clipped bare here and there where a window or a coat-of-arms broke through the dark veil. </span>
<span sid='46947' title='46947'>From this central block rose the twin towers, ancient, crenellated, and pierced with many loopholes. </span>
<span sid='46948' title='46948'>To right and left of the turrets were more modern wings of black granite. </span>
<span sid='46949' title='46949'>A dull light shone through heavy mullioned windows, and from the high chimneys which rose from the steep, high-angled roof there sprang a single black column of smoke.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46950' title='46950'>'Welcome, Sir Henry! </span>
<span sid='46951' title='46951'>Welcome, to Baskerville Hall!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46952' title='46952'>A tall man had stepped from the shadow of the porch to open the door of the wagonette. </span>
<span sid='46953' title='46953'>The figure of a woman was silhouetted against the yellow light of the hall. </span>
<span sid='46954' title='46954'>She came out and helped the man to hand down our bags.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46955' title='46955'>'You don't mind my driving straight home, Sir Henry?' said Dr Mortimer. </span>
<span sid='46956' title='46956'>'My wife is expecting me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46957' title='46957'>'Surely you will stay and have some dinner?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46958' title='46958'>'No, I must go. </span>
<span sid='46959' title='46959'>I shall probably find some work awaiting me. </span>
<span sid='46960' title='46960'>I would stay to show you over the house, but Barrymore will be a better guide than I. </span>
<span sid='46961' title='46961'>Good-bye, and never hesitate night or day to send for me if I can be of service.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46962' title='46962'>The wheels died away down the drive while Sir Henry and I turned into the hall, and the door clanged heavily behind us. </span>
<span sid='46963' title='46963'>It was a fine apartment in which we found ourselves, large, lofty, and heavily raftered with huge balks of age-blackened oak. </span>
<span sid='46964' title='46964'>In the great old-fashioned fireplace behind the high iron dogs a log-fire crackled and snapped. </span>
<span sid='46965' title='46965'>Sir Henry and I held out our hands to it, for we were numb from our long drive. </span>
<span sid='46966' title='46966'>Then we gazed round us at the high, thin window of old stained glass, the oak panelling, the stags' heads, the coats-of-arms upon the walls, all dim and sombre in the subdued light of the central lamp.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46967' title='46967'>It's just as I imagined it,' said Sir Henry. </span>
<span sid='46968' title='46968'>'Is it not the very picture of an old family home? </span>
<span sid='46969' title='46969'>To think that this should be the same hall in which for five hundred years my people have lived! </span>
<span sid='46970' title='46970'>It strikes me solemn to think of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46971' title='46971'>I saw his dark face lit up with a boyish enthusiasm as he gazed about him. </span>
<span sid='46972' title='46972'>The light beat upon him where he stood, but long shadows trailed down the walls and hung like a black canopy above him. </span>
<span sid='46973' title='46973'>Barrymore had returned from taking our luggage to our rooms. </span>
<span sid='46974' title='46974'>He stood in front of us now with the subdued manner of a well-trained servant. </span>
<span sid='46975' title='46975'>He was a remarkable-looking man, tall, handsome, with a square black beard, and pale, distinguished features.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46976' title='46976'>'Would you wish dinner to be served at once, sir?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46977' title='46977'>'Is it ready?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46978' title='46978'>'In a very few minutes, sir. </span>
<span sid='46979' title='46979'>You will find hot water in your rooms. </span>
<span sid='46980' title='46980'>My wife and I will be happy, Sir Henry, to stay with you until you have made your fresh arrangements, but you will understand that under the new conditions this house will require a considerable staff.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46981' title='46981'>'What new conditions?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46982' title='46982'>'I only meant, sir, that Sir Charles led a very retired life, and we were able to look after his wants. </span>
<span sid='46983' title='46983'>You would, naturally, wish to have more company, and so you will need changes in your household.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46984' title='46984'>'Do you mean that your wife and you wish to leave?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46985' title='46985'>'Only when it is quite convenient to you, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46986' title='46986'>'But your family have been with us for several generations, have they not? </span>
<span sid='46987' title='46987'>I should be sorry to begin my life here by breaking an old family connection.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46988' title='46988'>I seemed to discern some signs of emotion upon the butler's white face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='46989' title='46989'>'I feel that also, sir, and so does my wife. </span>
<span sid='46990' title='46990'>But to tell the truth, sir, we were both very much attached to Sir Charles, and his death gave us a shock and made these surroundings very painful to us. </span>
<span sid='46991' title='46991'>I fear that we shall never again be easy in our minds at Baskerville Hall.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46992' title='46992'>'But what do you intend to do?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46993' title='46993'>'I have no doubt, sir, that we shall succeed in establishing ourselves in some business. </span>
<span sid='46994' title='46994'>Sir Charles's generosity has given us the means to do so. </span>
<span sid='46995' title='46995'>And now, sir, perhaps I had best show you to your rooms.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='46996' title='46996'>A square balustraded gallery ran round the top of the old hall, approached by a double stair. </span>
<span sid='46997' title='46997'>From this central point two long corridors extended the whole length of the building, from which all the bedrooms opened. </span>
<span sid='46998' title='46998'>My own was in the same wing as Baskerville's and almost next door to it. </span>
<span sid='46999' title='46999'>These rooms appeared to be much more modern than the central part of the house, and the bright paper and numerous candles did something to remove the sombre impression which our arrival had left upon my mind.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47000' title='47000'>But the dining-room which opened out of the hall was a place of shadow and gloom. </span>
<span sid='47001' title='47001'>It was a long chamber with a step separating the dais where the family sat from the lower portion reserved for their dependents. </span>
<span sid='47002' title='47002'>At one end a minstrels' gallery overlooked it. </span>
<span sid='47003' title='47003'>Black beams shot across above our heads, with a smoke-darkened ceiling beyond them. </span>
<span sid='47004' title='47004'>With rows of flaring torches to light it up, and the colour and rude hilarity of an old-time banquet, it might have softened, but now, when two black-clothed gentlemen sat in the little circle of light thrown by a shaded lamp, one's voice became hushed and one's spirit subdued. </span>
<span sid='47005' title='47005'>A dim line of ancestors, in every variety of dress, from the Elizabethan knight to the buck of the Regency, stared down upon us and daunted us by their silent company. </span>
<span sid='47006' title='47006'>We talked little, and I for one was glad when the meal was over and we were able to retire into the modern billiard-room and smoke a cigarette.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47007' title='47007'>'My word, it isn't a very cheerful place,' said Sir Henry. </span>
<span sid='47008' title='47008'>'I suppose one can tone down to it, but I feel a bit out of the picture at present. </span>
<span sid='47009' title='47009'>I don't wonder that my uncle got a little jumpy if he lived all alone in such a house as this. </span>
<span sid='47010' title='47010'>However, if it suits you, we will retire early tonight, and perhaps things may seem more cheerful in the morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47011' title='47011'>I drew aside my curtains before I went to bed and looked out from my window. </span>
<span sid='47012' title='47012'>It opened upon the grassy space which lay in front of the hall door. </span>
<span sid='47013' title='47013'>Beyond, two copses of trees moaned and swung in a rising wind. </span>
<span sid='47014' title='47014'>A half moon broke through the rifts of racing clouds. </span>
<span sid='47015' title='47015'>In its cold light I saw beyond the trees a broken fringe of rocks and the long, low curve of the melancholy moor. </span>
<span sid='47016' title='47016'>I closed the curtain, feeling that my last impression was in keeping with the rest.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47017' title='47017'>And yet it was not quite the last. </span>
<span sid='47018' title='47018'>I found myself weary and yet wakeful, tossing restlessly from side to side, seeking for the sleep which would not come. </span>
<span sid='47019' title='47019'>Far away a chiming clock struck out the quarters of the hours, but otherwise a deathly silence lay upon the old house. </span>
<span sid='47020' title='47020'>And then suddenly, in the very dead of the night, there came a sound to my ears, clear, resonant, and unmistakable. </span>
<span sid='47021' title='47021'>It was the sob of a woman, the muffled, strangling gasp of one who is torn by an uncontrollable sorrow. </span>
<span sid='47022' title='47022'>I sat up in bed and listened intently. </span>
<span sid='47023' title='47023'>The noise could not have been far away, and was certainly in the house. </span>
<span sid='47024' title='47024'>For half an hour I waited with every nerve on the alert, but there came no other sound save the chiming clock and the rustle of the ivy on the wall.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47025' title='47025'>CHAPTER 7 : The Stapletons of Merripit House</span>
<p>
<span sid='47026' title='47026'>The fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface from our minds the grim and grey impression which had been left upon both of us by our first experience at Baskerville Hall. </span>
<span sid='47027' title='47027'>As Sir Henry and I sat at breakfast the sunlight flooded in through the high mullioned windows, throwing watery patches of colour from the coats-of-arms which covered them. </span>
<span sid='47028' title='47028'>The dark panelling glowed like bronze in the golden rays, and it was hard to realize that this was indeed the chamber which had struck such a gloom into our souls upon the evening before.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47029' title='47029'>'I guess it is ourselves and not the house that we have to blame!' said the Baronet. </span>
<span sid='47030' title='47030'>'We were tired with our journey and chilled by our drive, so we took a grey view of the place. </span>
<span sid='47031' title='47031'>Now we are fresh and well, so it is all cheerful once more.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47032' title='47032'>'And yet it was not entirely a question of imagination,' I answered. </span>
<span sid='47033' title='47033'>'Did you, for example, happen to hear someone, a woman I think, sobbing in the night?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47034' title='47034'>'That is curious, for I did when I was half asleep fancy that I heard something of the sort. </span>
<span sid='47035' title='47035'>I waited quite a time, but there was no more of it, so I concluded that it was all a dream.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47036' title='47036'>'I heard it distinctly, and I am sure that it was really the sob of a woman.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47037' title='47037'>'We must ask about this right away.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47038' title='47038'>He rang the bell and asked Barrymore whether he could account for our experience. </span>
<span sid='47039' title='47039'>It seemed to me that the pallid features of the butler turned a shade paler still as he listened to his master's question.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47040' title='47040'>'There are only two women in the house, Sir Henry,' he answered. </span>
<span sid='47041' title='47041'>'One is the scullery-maid, who sleeps in the other wing. </span>
<span sid='47042' title='47042'>The other is my wife, and I can answer for it that the sound could not have come from her.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47043' title='47043'>And yet he lied as he said it, for it chanced that after breakfast I met Mrs Barrymore in the long corridor with the sun full upon her face. </span>
<span sid='47044' title='47044'>She was a large, impassive, heavy-featured woman with a stern, set expression of mouth. </span>
<span sid='47045' title='47045'>But her tell-tale eyes were red and glanced at me from between swollen lids. </span>
<span sid='47046' title='47046'>It was she, then, who wept in the night, and if she did so her husband must know it. </span>
<span sid='47047' title='47047'>Yet he had taken the obvious risk of discovery in declaring that it was not so. </span>
<span sid='47048' title='47048'>Why had he done this? </span>
<span sid='47049' title='47049'>And why did she weep so bitterly? </span>
<span sid='47050' title='47050'>Already round this pale-faced, handsome, black-bearded man there was gathering an atmosphere of mystery and of gloom. </span>
<span sid='47051' title='47051'>It was he who had been the first to discover the body of Sir Charles, and we had only his word for all the circumstances which led up to the old man's death. </span>
<span sid='47052' title='47052'>Was it possible that it was Barrymore, after all, whom we had seen in the cab in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Regent Street&t=h'>Regent Street</a>? </span>
<span sid='47053' title='47053'>The beard might well have been the same. </span>
<span sid='47054' title='47054'>The cabman had described a somewhat shorter man, but such an impression might easily have been erroneous. </span>
<span sid='47055' title='47055'>How could I settle the point for ever? </span>
<span sid='47056' title='47056'>Obviously the first thing to do was to see the Grimpen postmaster, and find whether the test telegram had really been placed in Barrymore's own hands. </span>
<span sid='47057' title='47057'>Be the answer what it might, I should at least have something to report to Sherlock Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47058' title='47058'>Sir Henry had numerous papers to examine after breakfast, so that the time was propitious for my excursion. </span>
<span sid='47059' title='47059'>It was a pleasant walk of four miles along the edge of the moor, leading me at last to a small grey hamlet, in which two larger buildings, which proved to be the inn and the house of Dr Mortimer, stood high above the rest. </span>
<span sid='47060' title='47060'>The postmaster, who was also the village grocer, had a clear recollection of the telegram.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47061' title='47061'>'Certainly, sir,' said he, 'I had the telegram delivered to Mr Barrymore exactly as directed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47062' title='47062'>'Who delivered it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47063' title='47063'>'My boy here. </span>
<span sid='47064' title='47064'>James, you delivered that telegram to Mr Barrymore at the Hall last week, did you not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47065' title='47065'>'Yes, father, I delivered it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47066' title='47066'>'Into his own hands?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47067' title='47067'>'Well, he was up in the loft at the time, so that I could not put it into his own hands, but I gave it into Mrs Barrymore's hands, and she promised to deliver it at once.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47068' title='47068'>'Did you see Mr Barrymore?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47069' title='47069'>'No, sir, I tell you he was in the loft.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47070' title='47070'>'If you didn't see him, how do you know he was in the loft?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47071' title='47071'>'Well, surely his own wife ought to know where he is,' said the postmaster, testily. </span>
<span sid='47072' title='47072'>'Didn't he get the telegram? </span>
<span sid='47073' title='47073'>If there is any mistake it is for Mr Barrymore himself to complain.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47074' title='47074'>It seemed hopeless to pursue the inquiry any further, but it was clear that in spite of Holmes's ruse we had no proof that Barrymore had not been in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> all the time. </span>
<span sid='47075' title='47075'>Suppose that it were so - suppose that the same man had been the last who had seen Sir Charles alive, and the first to dog the new heir when he returned to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>. </span>
<span sid='47076' title='47076'>What then? </span>
<span sid='47077' title='47077'>Was he the agent of others, or had he some sinister design of his own? </span>
<span sid='47078' title='47078'>What interest could he have in persecuting the Baskerville family? </span>
<span sid='47079' title='47079'>I thought of the strange warning clipped out of the leading article of The Times. </span>
<span sid='47080' title='47080'>Was that his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was bent upon counteracting his schemes? </span>
<span sid='47081' title='47081'>The only conceivable motive was that which had been suggested by Sir Henry, that if the family could be scared away a comfortable and permanent home would be secured for the Barrymores. </span>
<span sid='47082' title='47082'>But surely such an explanation as that would be quite inadequate to account for the deep and subtle scheming which seemed to be weaving an invisible net round the young baronet. </span>
<span sid='47083' title='47083'>Holmes himself had said that no more complex case had come to him in all the long series of his sensational investigations. </span>
<span sid='47084' title='47084'>I prayed, as I walked back along the grey, lonely road, that my friend might soon be freed from his preoccupations and able to come down to take this heavy burden of responsibility from my shoulders.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47085' title='47085'>Suddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of running feet behind me and by a voice which called me by name. </span>
<span sid='47086' title='47086'>I turned, expecting to see Dr Mortimer, but to my surprise it was a stranger who was pursuing me. </span>
<span sid='47087' title='47087'>He was a small, slim, clean-shaven, prim-faced man, flaxen-haired and lean-jawed, between thirty and forty years of age, dressed in a grey suit and wearing a straw hat. </span>
<span sid='47088' title='47088'>A tin box for botanical specimens hung over his shoulder, and he carried a green butterfly-net in one of his hands.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47089' title='47089'>'You will, I am sure, excuse my presumption, Dr Watson,' said he, as he came panting up to where I stood. </span>
<span sid='47090' title='47090'>'Here on the moor we are homely folk, and do not wait for formal introductions. </span>
<span sid='47091' title='47091'>You may possibly have heard my name from our mutual friend, Mortimer. </span>
<span sid='47092' title='47092'>I am Stapleton, of Merripit House.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47093' title='47093'>'Your net and box would have told me as much,' said I, 'for I knew that Mr Stapleton was a naturalist. </span>
<span sid='47094' title='47094'>But how did you know me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47095' title='47095'>'I have been calling on Mortimer, and he pointed you out to me from the window of his surgery as you passed. </span>
<span sid='47096' title='47096'>As our road lay the same way I thought that I would overtake you and introduce myself. </span>
<span sid='47097' title='47097'>I trust that Sir Henry is none the worse for his journey?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47098' title='47098'>'He is very well, thank you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47099' title='47099'>'We were all rather afraid that after the sad death of Sir Charles the new baronet might refuse to live here. </span>
<span sid='47100' title='47100'>It is asking much of a wealthy man to come down and bury himself in a place of this kind, but I need not tell you that it means a very great deal to the country-side. </span>
<span sid='47101' title='47101'>Sir Henry has, I suppose, no superstitious fears in the matter?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47102' title='47102'>'I do not think that it is likely.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47103' title='47103'>'Of course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunts the family?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47104' title='47104'>'I have heard it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47105' title='47105'>'It is extraordinary how credulous the peasants are about here! </span>
<span sid='47106' title='47106'>Any number of them are ready to swear that they have seen such a creature upon the moor.' </span>
<span sid='47107' title='47107'>He spoke with a smile, but I seemed to read in his eyes that he took the matter more seriously. </span>
<span sid='47108' title='47108'>'The story took a great hold upon the imagination of Sir Charles, and I have no doubt that it led to his tragic end.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47109' title='47109'>'But how?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47110' title='47110'>'His nerves were so worked up that the appearance of any dog might have had a fatal effect upon his diseased heart. </span>
<span sid='47111' title='47111'>I fancy that he really did see something of the kind upon that last night in the Yew Alley. </span>
<span sid='47112' title='47112'>I feared that some disaster might occur, for I was very fond of the old man, and I knew that his heart was weak.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47113' title='47113'>'How did you know that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47114' title='47114'>'My friend Mortimer told me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47115' title='47115'>'You think then, that some dog pursued Sir Charles, and that he died of fright in consequence?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47116' title='47116'>'Have you any better explanation?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47117' title='47117'>'I have not come to any conclusion.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47118' title='47118'>'Has Mr Sherlock Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47119' title='47119'>The words took away my breath for an instant, but a glance at the placid face and steadfast eyes of my companion showed no surprise was intended.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47120' title='47120'>'It is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you, Dr Watson,' said he. </span>
<span sid='47121' title='47121'>'The records of your detective have reached us here, and you could not celebrate him without being known yourself. </span>
<span sid='47122' title='47122'>When Mortimer told me your name he could not deny your identity. </span>
<span sid='47123' title='47123'>If you are here, then it follows that Mr Sherlock Holmes is interesting himself in the matter, and I am naturally curious to know what view he may take.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47124' title='47124'>'I am afraid that I cannot answer that question.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47125' title='47125'>'May I ask if he is going to honour us with a visit himself?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47126' title='47126'>'He cannot leave town at present. </span>
<span sid='47127' title='47127'>He has other cases which engage his attention.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47128' title='47128'>'What a pity! </span>
<span sid='47129' title='47129'>He might throw some light on that which is so dark to us. </span>
<span sid='47130' title='47130'>But as to your own researches, if there is any possible way in which I can be of service to you, I trust that you will command me. </span>
<span sid='47131' title='47131'>If I had any indication of the nature of your suspicions, or how you propose to investigate the case, I might perhaps even now give you some aid or advice.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47132' title='47132'>'I assure you that I am simply here upon a visit to my friend Sir Henry, and that I need no help of any kind.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47133' title='47133'>'Excellent!' said Stapleton. </span>
<span sid='47134' title='47134'>'You are perfectly right to be wary and discreet. </span>
<span sid='47135' title='47135'>I am justly reproved for what I feel was an unjustifiable intrusion, and I promise you that I will not mention the matter again.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47136' title='47136'>We had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from the road and wound away across the moor. </span>
<span sid='47137' title='47137'>A steep, boulder-sprinkled hill lay upon the right which had in bygone days been cut into a granite quarry. </span>
<span sid='47138' title='47138'>The face which was turned towards us formed a dark cliff, with ferns and brambles growing in its niches. </span>
<span sid='47139' title='47139'>From over a distant rise there floated a grey plume of smoke.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47140' title='47140'>'A moderate walk along this moor-path brings us to Merripit House,' said he. </span>
<span sid='47141' title='47141'>'Perhaps you will spare an hour that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to my sister.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47142' title='47142'>My first thought was that I should be by Sir Henry's side. </span>
<span sid='47143' title='47143'>But then I remembered the pile of papers and bills with which his study table was littered. </span>
<span sid='47144' title='47144'>It was certain that I could not help him with those. </span>
<span sid='47145' title='47145'>And Holmes had expressly said that I should study the neighbours upon the moor. </span>
<span sid='47146' title='47146'>I accepted Stapleton's invitation, and we turned together down the path.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47147' title='47147'>'It is a wonderful place, the moor,' said he, looking round over the undulating downs, long green rollers, with crests of jagged granite foaming up into fantastic surges. </span>
<span sid='47148' title='47148'>'You never tire of the moor. </span>
<span sid='47149' title='47149'>You cannot think the wonderful secrets which it contains. </span>
<span sid='47150' title='47150'>It is so vast, and so barren, and so mysterious.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47151' title='47151'>'You know it well, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47152' title='47152'>'I have only been here two years. </span>
<span sid='47153' title='47153'>The residents would call me a new-comer. </span>
<span sid='47154' title='47154'>We came shortly after Sir Charles settled. </span>
<span sid='47155' title='47155'>But my tastes led me to explore every part of the country round, and I should think that there are few men who know it better than I do.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47156' title='47156'>'Is it so hard to know?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47157' title='47157'>'Very hard. </span>
<span sid='47158' title='47158'>You see, for example, this great plain to the north here, with the queer hills breaking out of it. </span>
<span sid='47159' title='47159'>Do you observe anything remarkable about that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47160' title='47160'>'It would be a rare place for a gallop.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47161' title='47161'>'You would naturally think so, and the thought has cost folk their lives before now. </span>
<span sid='47162' title='47162'>You notice those bright green spots scattered thickly over it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47163' title='47163'>'Yes, they seem more fertile than the rest.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47164' title='47164'>Stapleton laughed. </span>
<span sid='47165' title='47165'>'That is the great Grimpen Mire,' said he. </span>
<span sid='47166' title='47166'>'A false step yonder means death to man or beast. </span>
<span sid='47167' title='47167'>Only yesterday I saw one of the moor ponies wander into it. </span>
<span sid='47168' title='47168'>He never came out. </span>
<span sid='47169' title='47169'>I saw his head for quite a long time craning out of the bog-hole, but it sucked him down at last. </span>
<span sid='47170' title='47170'>Even in dry seasons it is a danger to cross it, but after these autumn rains it is an awful place. </span>
<span sid='47171' title='47171'>And yet I can find my way to the very heart of it and return alive. </span>
<span sid='47172' title='47172'>By George, there is another of those miserable ponies!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47173' title='47173'>Something brown was rolling and tossing among the green sedges. </span>
<span sid='47174' title='47174'>Then a long, agonized, writhing neck shot upwards and a dreadful cry echoed over the moor. </span>
<span sid='47175' title='47175'>It turned me cold with horror, but my companion's nerves seemed to be stronger than mine.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47176' title='47176'>'It's gone!' said he. </span>
<span sid='47177' title='47177'>'The Mire has him. </span>
<span sid='47178' title='47178'>Two in two days, and many more, perhaps, for they get in the way of going there in the dry weather, and never know the difference until the Mire has them in its clutch. </span>
<span sid='47179' title='47179'>It's a bad place, the great Grimpen Mire.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47180' title='47180'>'And you say you can penetrate it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47181' title='47181'>'Yes, there are one or two paths which a very active man can take. </span>
<span sid='47182' title='47182'>I have found them out.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47183' title='47183'>'But why should you wish to go into so horrible a place?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47184' title='47184'>'Well, you see the hills beyond? </span>
<span sid='47185' title='47185'>They are really islands cut off on all sides by the impassable Mire, which has crawled round them in the course of years. </span>
<span sid='47186' title='47186'>That is where the rare plants and the butterflies are, if you have the wit to reach them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47187' title='47187'>'I shall try my luck some day.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47188' title='47188'>He looked at me with a surprised face. </span>
<span sid='47189' title='47189'>'For God's sake put such an idea out of your mind,' said he. </span>
<span sid='47190' title='47190'>'Your blood would be upon my head. </span>
<span sid='47191' title='47191'>I assure you that there would not be the least chance of your coming back alive. </span>
<span sid='47192' title='47192'>It is only by remembering certain complex landmarks that I am able to do it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47193' title='47193'>'Hullo,' I cried. </span>
<span sid='47194' title='47194'>'What is that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47195' title='47195'>A long, low moan, indescribably sad, swept over the moor. </span>
<span sid='47196' title='47196'>It filled the whole air, and yet it was impossible to say whence it came. </span>
<span sid='47197' title='47197'>From a dull murmur it swelled into a deep roar and then sank back into a melancholy, throbbing murmur once again. </span>
<span sid='47198' title='47198'>Stapleton looked at me with a curious expression on his face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47199' title='47199'>'Queer place, the moor!' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47200' title='47200'>'But what is it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47201' title='47201'>'The peasants say it is the Hound of the Baskervilles calling for its prey. </span>
<span sid='47202' title='47202'>I've heard it once or twice before, but never quite so loud.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47203' title='47203'>I looked round, with a chill of fear in my heart, at the huge swelling plain, mottled with the green patches of rushes. </span>
<span sid='47204' title='47204'>Nothing stirred over the vast expanse save a pair of ravens, which croaked loudly from a tor behind us. </span>
<span sid='47205' title='47205'>'You are an educated man. </span>
<span sid='47206' title='47206'>You don't believe such nonsense as that?' said I. </span>
<span sid='47207' title='47207'>'What do you think is the cause of so strange a sound?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47208' title='47208'>'Bogs make queer noises sometimes. </span>
<span sid='47209' title='47209'>It's the mud settling, or the water rising, or something.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47210' title='47210'>'No, no, that was a living voice.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47211' title='47211'>'Well, perhaps it was. </span>
<span sid='47212' title='47212'>Did you ever hear a bittern booming?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47213' title='47213'>'No, I never did.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47214' title='47214'>'It's a very rare bird - practically extinct - in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> now, but all things are possible upon the moor. </span>
<span sid='47215' title='47215'>Yes, I should not be surprised to learn that what we have heard is the cry of the last of the bitterns.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47216' title='47216'>'It's the weirdest, strangest thing that ever I heard in my life.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47217' title='47217'>'Yes, it's rather an uncanny place altogether. </span>
<span sid='47218' title='47218'>Look at the hillside yonder. </span>
<span sid='47219' title='47219'>What do you make of those?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47220' title='47220'>The whole steep slope was covered with grey circular rings of stone, a score of them at least.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47221' title='47221'>'What are they? </span>
<span sid='47222' title='47222'>Sheep-pens?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47223' title='47223'>'No, they are the homes of our worthy ancestors. </span>
<span sid='47224' title='47224'>Prehistoric man lived thickly on the moor, and as no one in particular has lived there since, we find all his little arrangements exactly as he left them. </span>
<span sid='47225' title='47225'>These are his wigwams with the roofs off. </span>
<span sid='47226' title='47226'>You can even see his hearth and his couch if you have the curiosity to go inside.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47227' title='47227'>'But it is quite a town. </span>
<span sid='47228' title='47228'>When was it inhabited?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47229' title='47229'>'Neolithic man - no date.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47230' title='47230'>'What did he do?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47231' title='47231'>'He grazed his cattle on these slopes, and he learned to dig for tin when the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe. </span>
<span sid='47232' title='47232'>Look at the great trench in the opposite hill. </span>
<span sid='47233' title='47233'>That is his mark. </span>
<span sid='47234' title='47234'>Yes, you will find some very singular points about the moor, Dr Watson. </span>
<span sid='47235' title='47235'>Oh, excuse me an instant! </span>
<span sid='47236' title='47236'>It is surely Cyclopides.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47237' title='47237'>A small fly or moth had fluttered across our path, and in an instant Stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of it. </span>
<span sid='47238' title='47238'>To my dismay the creature flew straight for the great Mire, but my acquaintance never paused for an instant, bounding from tuft to tuft behind it, his green net waving in the air. </span>
<span sid='47239' title='47239'>His grey clothes and jerky, zigzag, irregular progress made him not unlike some huge moth himself. </span>
<span sid='47240' title='47240'>I was standing watching his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the treacherous Mire, when I heard the sound of steps, and, turning round, found a woman near me upon the path. </span>
<span sid='47241' title='47241'>She had come from the direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of Merripit House, but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was quite close.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47242' title='47242'>I could not doubt that this was the Miss Stapleton of whom I had been told, since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor, and I remembered that I had heard someone describe her as being a beauty. </span>
<span sid='47243' title='47243'>The woman who approached me was certainly that, and of a most uncommon type. </span>
<span sid='47244' title='47244'>There could not have been a greater contrast between brother and sister, for Stapleton was neutral tinted, with light hair and grey eyes, while she was darker than any brunette whom I have seen in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> - slim, elegant, and tall. </span>
<span sid='47245' title='47245'>She had a proud, finely cut face, so regular that it might have seemed impassive were it not for the sensitive mouth and the beautiful dark, eager eyes. </span>
<span sid='47246' title='47246'>With her perfect figure and elegant dress she was, indeed, a strange apparition upon a lonely moorland path. </span>
<span sid='47247' title='47247'>Her eyes were on her brother as I turned, and then she quickened her pace towards me. </span>
<span sid='47248' title='47248'>I had raised my hat, and was about to make some explanatory remark, when her own words turned all my thoughts into a new channel.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47249' title='47249'>'Go back!' she said. </span>
<span sid='47250' title='47250'>'Go straight back to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, instantly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47251' title='47251'>I could only stare at her in stupid surprise. </span>
<span sid='47252' title='47252'>Her eyes blazed at me, and she tapped the ground impatiently with her foot.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47253' title='47253'>'Why should I go back?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47254' title='47254'>'I cannot explain.' </span>
<span sid='47255' title='47255'>She spoke in a low, eager voice, with a curious lisp in her utterance. </span>
<span sid='47256' title='47256'>'But for God's sake do what I ask you. </span>
<span sid='47257' title='47257'>Go back and never set foot upon the moor again.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47258' title='47258'>'But I have only just come.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47259' title='47259'>'Man, man!' she cried. </span>
<span sid='47260' title='47260'>'Can you not tell when a warning is for your own good? </span>
<span sid='47261' title='47261'>Go back to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>! </span>
<span sid='47262' title='47262'>Start to-night! </span>
<span sid='47263' title='47263'>Get away from this place at all costs! </span>
<span sid='47264' title='47264'>Hush, my brother is coming! </span>
<span sid='47265' title='47265'>Not a word of what I have said. </span>
<span sid='47266' title='47266'>Would you mind getting that orchid for me among the mare's-tails yonder? </span>
<span sid='47267' title='47267'>We are very rich in orchids on the moor, though, of course, you are rather late to see the beauties of the place.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47268' title='47268'>Stapleton had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing hard and flushed with his exertions.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47269' title='47269'>'Hullo, Beryl!' said he, and it seemed to me that the tone of his greeting was not altogether a cordial one.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47270' title='47270'>'Well, Jack, you are very hot.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47271' title='47271'>'Yes, I was chasing a Cyclopides. </span>
<span sid='47272' title='47272'>He is very rare, and seldom found in the late autumn. </span>
<span sid='47273' title='47273'>What a pity that I should have missed him!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47274' title='47274'>He spoke unconcernedly, but his small light eyes glanced incessantly from the girl to me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47275' title='47275'>'You have introduced yourselves, I can see.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47276' title='47276'>'Yes. </span>
<span sid='47277' title='47277'>I was telling Sir Henry that it was rather late for him to see the true beauties of the moor.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47278' title='47278'>'Why, who do you think this is?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47279' title='47279'>'I imagine that it must be Sir Henry Baskerville.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47280' title='47280'>'No, no,' said I. </span>
<span sid='47281' title='47281'>'Only a humble commoner, but his friend. </span>
<span sid='47282' title='47282'>My name is Dr Watson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47283' title='47283'>A flush of vexation passed over her expressive face. </span>
<span sid='47284' title='47284'>'We have been talking at cross purposes,' said she. </span>
<span sid='47285' title='47285'>'Why, you had not very much time for talk,' her brother remarked, with the same questioning eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47286' title='47286'>'I talked as if Dr Watson were a resident instead of being merely a visitor,' said she. </span>
<span sid='47287' title='47287'>'It cannot much matter to him whether it is early or late for the orchids. </span>
<span sid='47288' title='47288'>But you will come on, will you not, and see Merripit House?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47289' title='47289'>A short walk brought us to it, a bleak moorland house, once the farm of some grazier in the old prosperous days, but now put into repair and turned into a modern dwelling. </span>
<span sid='47290' title='47290'>An orchard surrounded it, but the trees, as is usual upon the moor, were stunted and nipped, and the effect of the whole place was mean and melancholy. </span>
<span sid='47291' title='47291'>We were admitted by a strange, wizened, rusty-coated old manservant, who seemed in keeping with the house. </span>
<span sid='47292' title='47292'>Inside, however, there were large rooms furnished with an elegance in which I seemed to recognize the taste of the lady. </span>
<span sid='47293' title='47293'>As I looked from their windows at the interminable granite-flecked moor rolling unbroken to the farthest horizon I could not but marvel at what could have brought this highly educated man and this beautiful woman to live in such a place.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47294' title='47294'>'Queer spot to choose, is it not?' said he, as if in answer to my thought. </span>
<span sid='47295' title='47295'>'And yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy, do we not, Beryl?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47296' title='47296'>'Quite happy,' said she, but there was no ring of conviction in her words.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47297' title='47297'>'I had a school,' said Stapleton. </span>
<span sid='47298' title='47298'>'It was in the north country. </span>
<span sid='47299' title='47299'>The work to a man of my temperament was mechanical and uninteresting, but the privilege of living with youth, of helping to mould those young minds and of impressing them with one's own character and ideals, was very dear to me. </span>
<span sid='47300' title='47300'>However, the fates were against us. </span>
<span sid='47301' title='47301'>A serious epidemic broke out in the school, and three of the boys died. </span>
<span sid='47302' title='47302'>It never recovered from the blow, and much of my capital was irretrievably swallowed up. </span>
<span sid='47303' title='47303'>And yet, if it were not for the loss of the charming companionship of the boys, I could rejoice over my own misfortune, for, with my strong tastes for botany and zoology, I find an unlimited field of work here, and my sister is as devoted to Nature as I am. </span>
<span sid='47304' title='47304'>All this, Dr Watson, has been brought upon your head by your expression as you surveyed the moor out of our window.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47305' title='47305'>'It certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little dull - less for you, perhaps, than for your sister.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47306' title='47306'>'No, no, I am never dull,' said she quickly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47307' title='47307'>'We have books, we have our studies, and we have interesting neighbours. </span>
<span sid='47308' title='47308'>Dr Mortimer is a most learned man in his own line. </span>
<span sid='47309' title='47309'>Poor Sir Charles was also an admirable companion. </span>
<span sid='47310' title='47310'>We knew him well, and miss him more than I can tell. </span>
<span sid='47311' title='47311'>Do you think that I should intrude if I were to call this afternoon and make the acquaintance of Sir Henry?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47312' title='47312'>'I am sure that he would be delighted.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47313' title='47313'>'Then perhaps you would mention that I propose to do so. </span>
<span sid='47314' title='47314'>We may in our humble way do something to make things more easy for him until he becomes accustomed to his new surroundings. </span>
<span sid='47315' title='47315'>Will you come upstairs, Dr Watson, and inspect my collection of Lepidoptera? </span>
<span sid='47316' title='47316'>I think it is the most complete one in the south-west of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>. </span>
<span sid='47317' title='47317'>By the time that you have looked through them lunch will be almost ready.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47318' title='47318'>But I was eager to get back to my charge. </span>
<span sid='47319' title='47319'>The melancholy of the moor, the death of the unfortunate pony, the weird sound which had been associated with the grim legend of the Baskervilles-all these things tinged my thoughts with sadness. </span>
<span sid='47320' title='47320'>Then on the top of these more or less vague impressions there had come the definite and distinct warning of Miss Stapleton, delivered with such intense earnestness that I could not doubt that some grave and deep reason lay behind it. </span>
<span sid='47321' title='47321'>I resisted all pressure to stay for lunch, and I set off at once upon my return journey, taking the grass-grown path by which we had come.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47322' title='47322'>It seems, however, that there must have been some short cut for those who knew it, for before I had reached the road I was astounded to see Miss Stapleton sitting upon a rock by the side of the track. </span>
<span sid='47323' title='47323'>Her face was beautifully flushed with her exertions, and she held her hand to her side.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47324' title='47324'>'I have run all the way in order to cut you off, Dr Watson,' said she. </span>
<span sid='47325' title='47325'>'I had not even time to put on my hat. </span>
<span sid='47326' title='47326'>I must not stop, or my brother may miss me. </span>
<span sid='47327' title='47327'>I wanted to say to you how sorry I am about the stupid mistake I made in thinking that you were Sir Henry. </span>
<span sid='47328' title='47328'>Please forget the words I said, which have no application whatever to you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47329' title='47329'>'But I can't forget them, Miss Stapleton,' said I. </span>
<span sid='47330' title='47330'>'I am Sir Henry's friend, and his welfare is a very close concern of mine. </span>
<span sid='47331' title='47331'>Tell me why it was that you were so eager that Sir Henry should return to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47332' title='47332'>'A woman's whim, Dr Watson. </span>
<span sid='47333' title='47333'>When you know me better you will understand that I cannot always give reasons for what I say or do.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47334' title='47334'>'No, no. </span>
<span sid='47335' title='47335'>I remember the thrill in your voice. </span>
<span sid='47336' title='47336'>I remember the look in your eyes. </span>
<span sid='47337' title='47337'>Please, please, be frank with me, Miss Stapleton, for ever since I have been here I have been conscious of shadows all round me. </span>
<span sid='47338' title='47338'>Life has become like that great Grimpen Mire, with little green patches everywhere into which one may sink and with no guide to point the track. </span>
<span sid='47339' title='47339'>Tell me, then, what it was that you meant, and I will promise to convey your warning to Sir Henry.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47340' title='47340'>An expression of irresolution passed for an instant over her face, but her eyes had hardened again when she answered me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47341' title='47341'>'You make too much of it, Dr Watson,' said she. </span>
<span sid='47342' title='47342'>'My brother and I were very much shocked by the death of Sir Charles. </span>
<span sid='47343' title='47343'>We knew him very intimately, for his favourite walk was over the moor to our house. </span>
<span sid='47344' title='47344'>He was deeply impressed with the curse which hung over his family, and when this tragedy came I naturally felt that there must be some grounds for the fears he had expressed. </span>
<span sid='47345' title='47345'>I was distressed, therefore, when another member of the family came down to live here, and I felt that he should be warned of the danger which he will run. </span>
<span sid='47346' title='47346'>That was all which I intended to convey.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47347' title='47347'>'But what is the danger?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47348' title='47348'>'You know the story of the hound?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47349' title='47349'>'I do not believe in such nonsense.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47350' title='47350'>'But I do. </span>
<span sid='47351' title='47351'>If you have any influence with Sir Henry, take him away from a place which has always been fatal to his family. </span>
<span sid='47352' title='47352'>The world is wide. </span>
<span sid='47353' title='47353'>Why should he wish to live at the place of danger?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47354' title='47354'>'Because it is the place of danger. </span>
<span sid='47355' title='47355'>That is Sir Henry's nature. </span>
<span sid='47356' title='47356'>I fear that unless you can give me some more definite information than this it would be impossible to get him to move.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47357' title='47357'>'I cannot say anything definite, for I do not know anything definite.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47358' title='47358'>'I would ask you one more question, Miss Stapleton. </span>
<span sid='47359' title='47359'>If you meant no more than this when you first spoke to me, why should you not wish your brother to overhear what you said? </span>
<span sid='47360' title='47360'>There is nothing to which he, or anyone else, could object.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47361' title='47361'>'My brother is very anxious to have the Hall inhabited, for he thinks that it is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor. </span>
<span sid='47362' title='47362'>He would be very angry if he knew that I had said anything which might induce Sir Henry to go away. </span>
<span sid='47363' title='47363'>But I have done my duty now and I will say no more. </span>
<span sid='47364' title='47364'>I must get back, or he will miss me and suspect that I have seen you. </span>
<span sid='47365' title='47365'>Good-bye!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47366' title='47366'>She turned, and had disappeared in a few minutes among the scattered boulders, while I, with my soul full of vague fears, pursued my way to Baskerville Hall.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47367' title='47367'>CHAPTER 8 : First Report of Dr Watson</span>
<p>
<span sid='47368' title='47368'>From this point onwards will follow the course of events by transcribing my own letters to Mr Sherlock Holmes which lie before me on the table. </span>
<span sid='47369' title='47369'>One page is missing, but otherwise they are exactly as written, and show my feelings and suspicions of the moment more accurately than my memory, clear as it is upon these tragic events, can possibly do.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47370' title='47370'>Baskerville Hall, Oct. 13th</span>
<p>
<span sid='47371' title='47371'>My Dear Holmes,</span>
<p>
<span sid='47372' title='47372'>My previous letters and telegrams have kept you pretty well up-to-date as to all that has occurred in this most Godforsaken corner of the world. </span>
<span sid='47373' title='47373'>The longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one's soul, its vastness, and also its grim charm. </span>
<span sid='47374' title='47374'>When you are once out upon its bosom you have left all traces of modern <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> behind you, but on the other hand you are conscious everywhere of the homes and the work of prehistoric people. </span>
<span sid='47375' title='47375'>On all sides of you as you walk are the houses of these forgotten folk, with their graves and the huge monoliths which are supposed to have marked their temples. </span>
<span sid='47376' title='47376'>As you look at their grey stone huts against the scarred hillsides you leave your own age behind you, and if you were to see a skin-clad, hairy man crawl out from the low door, fitting a flint-tipped arrow on to the string of his bow, you would feel that his presence there was more natural than your own. </span>
<span sid='47377' title='47377'>The strange thing is that they should have lived so thickly on what must always have been most unfruitful soil. </span>
<span sid='47378' title='47378'>I am no antiquarian, but I could imagine that they were some unwarlike and harried race who were forced to accept that which none other would occupy.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47379' title='47379'>All this however, is foreign to the mission on which you sent me, and will probably be very uninteresting to your severely practical mind. </span>
<span sid='47380' title='47380'>I can still remember your complete indifference as to whether the sun moved round the earth or the earth round the sun. </span>
<span sid='47381' title='47381'>Let me, therefore, return to the facts concerning Sir Henry Baskerville.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47382' title='47382'>If you have not had any report within the last few days it is because up till to-day there was nothing of importance to relate. </span>
<span sid='47383' title='47383'>Then a very surprising circumstance occurred, which I shall tell you in due course. </span>
<span sid='47384' title='47384'>But, first of all, I must keep you in touch with some of the other factors in the situation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47385' title='47385'>One of these, concerning which I have said little, is the escaped convict upon the moor. </span>
<span sid='47386' title='47386'>There is strong reason now to believe that he has got right away, which is a considerable relief to the lonely householders of this district. </span>
<span sid='47387' title='47387'>A fortnight has passed since his flight, during which he has not been seen and nothing has been heard of him. </span>
<span sid='47388' title='47388'>It is surely inconceivable that he could have held out upon the moor during all that time. </span>
<span sid='47389' title='47389'>Of course, so far as his concealment goes there is no difficulty at all. </span>
<span sid='47390' title='47390'>Any one of these stone huts would give him a hiding-place. </span>
<span sid='47391' title='47391'>But there is nothing to eat unless he were to catch and slaughter one of the moor sheep. </span>
<span sid='47392' title='47392'>We think, therefore, that he has gone, and the outlying farmers sleep the better in consequence.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47393' title='47393'>We are four able-bodied men in this household, so that we could take good care of ourselves, but I confess that I have had uneasy moments when I have thought of the Stapletons. </span>
<span sid='47394' title='47394'>They live miles from any help. </span>
<span sid='47395' title='47395'>There are one maid, an old manservant, the sister, and the brother, the latter not a very strong man. </span>
<span sid='47396' title='47396'>They would be helpless in the hands of a desperate fellow like this <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Notting Hill&t=h'>Notting Hill</a> criminal, if he could once effect an entrance. </span>
<span sid='47397' title='47397'>Both Sir Henry and I were concerned at their situation, and it was suggested that Perkins the groom should go over to sleep there, but Stapleton would not hear of it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47398' title='47398'>The fact is that our friend the baronet begins to display a considerable interest in our fair neighbour. </span>
<span sid='47399' title='47399'>It is not to be wondered at, for time hangs heavily in this lonely spot to an active man like him, and she is a very fascinating and beautiful woman. </span>
<span sid='47400' title='47400'>There is something tropical and exotic about her which forms a singular contrast to her cool and unemotional brother. </span>
<span sid='47401' title='47401'>Yet he also gives the idea of hidden fires. </span>
<span sid='47402' title='47402'>He has certainly a very marked influence over her, for I have seen her continually glance at him as she talked as if seeking approbation for what she said. </span>
<span sid='47403' title='47403'>I trust that he is kind to her. </span>
<span sid='47404' title='47404'>There is a dry glitter in his eyes, and a firm set of his thin lips, which go with a positive and possibly a harsh nature. </span>
<span sid='47405' title='47405'>You would find him an interesting study.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47406' title='47406'>He came over to call upon Baskerville on that first day, and the very next morning he took us both to show us the spot where the legend of the wicked Hugo is supposed to have had its origin. </span>
<span sid='47407' title='47407'>It was an excursion of some miles across the moor to a place which is so dismal that it might have suggested the story. </span>
<span sid='47408' title='47408'>We found a short valley between rugged tors which led to an open, grassy space flecked over with the white cotton grass. </span>
<span sid='47409' title='47409'>In the middle of it rose two great stones, worn and sharpened at the upper end, until they looked like the huge, corroding fangs of some monstrous beast. </span>
<span sid='47410' title='47410'>In every way it corresponded with the scene of the old tragedy. </span>
<span sid='47411' title='47411'>Sir Henry was much interested, and asked Stapleton more than once whether he did really believe in the possibility of the interference of the supernatural in the affairs of men. </span>
<span sid='47412' title='47412'>He spoke lightly, but it was evident that he was very much in earnest. </span>
<span sid='47413' title='47413'>Stapleton was guarded in his replies, but it was easy to see that he said less than he might, and that he would not express his whole opinion out of consideration for the feelings of the Baronet. </span>
<span sid='47414' title='47414'>He told us of similar cases where families had suffered from some evil influence, and he left us with the impression that he shared the popular view upon the matter.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47415' title='47415'>On our way back we stayed for lunch at Merripit House, and it was there that Sir Henry made the acquaintance of Miss Stapleton. </span>
<span sid='47416' title='47416'>From the first moment that he saw her he appeared to be strongly attracted by her, and I am much mistaken if the feeling was not mutual. </span>
<span sid='47417' title='47417'>He referred to her again and again on our walk home, and since then hardly a day has passed that we have not seen something of the brother and sister. </span>
<span sid='47418' title='47418'>They dine here to-night, and there is some talk of our going to them next week. </span>
<span sid='47419' title='47419'>One would imagine that such a match would be very welcome to Stapleton, and yet I have more than once caught a look of the strongest disapprobation in his face when Sir Henry has been paying some attention to his sister. </span>
<span sid='47420' title='47420'>He is much attached to her, no doubt, and would lead a lonely life without her, but it would seem the height of selfishness, if he were to stand in the way of her making so brilliant a marriage. </span>
<span sid='47421' title='47421'>Yet I am certain that he does not wish their intimacy to ripen into love, and I have several times observed that he has taken pains to prevent them from being tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte. </span>
<span sid='47422' title='47422'>By the way, your instructions to me never to allow Sir Henry to go out alone will become very much more onerous if a love affair were to be added to our other difficulties. </span>
<span sid='47423' title='47423'>My popularity would soon suffer if I were to carry out your orders to, the letter.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47424' title='47424'>The other day - Thursday, to be more exact - Dr Mortimer lunched with us. </span>
<span sid='47425' title='47425'>He has been excavating a barrow at Long Down, and has got a prehistoric skull which fills him with great joy. </span>
<span sid='47426' title='47426'>Never was there such a single-minded enthusiast as he! </span>
<span sid='47427' title='47427'>The Stapletons came in afterwards, and the good doctor took us all to the Yew Alley, at Sir Henry's request, to show us exactly how everything occurred upon that fatal night. </span>
<span sid='47428' title='47428'>It is a long, dismal walk, the Yew Alley, between two high walls of clipped hedge, with a narrow band of grass upon either side. </span>
<span sid='47429' title='47429'>At the far end is an old, tumble-down summer-house. </span>
<span sid='47430' title='47430'>Half-way down is the moor-gate, where the old gentleman left his cigar ash. </span>
<span sid='47431' title='47431'>It is a white wooden gate with a latch. </span>
<span sid='47432' title='47432'>Beyond it lies the wide moor. </span>
<span sid='47433' title='47433'>I remembered your theory of the affair and tried to picture all that had occurred. </span>
<span sid='47434' title='47434'>As the old man stood there he saw something coming across the moor, something which terrified him so that he lost his wits, and ran and ran until he died of sheer horror and exhaustion. </span>
<span sid='47435' title='47435'>There was the long, gloomy tunnel down which he fled. </span>
<span sid='47436' title='47436'>And from what? </span>
<span sid='47437' title='47437'>A sheep-dog of the moor? </span>
<span sid='47438' title='47438'>Or a spectral hound, black, silent, and monstrous?</span>
<p>
<span sid='47439' title='47439'>Was there a human agency in the matter? </span>
<span sid='47440' title='47440'>Did the pale, watchful Barrymore know more than he cared to say? </span>
<span sid='47441' title='47441'>It was all dim and vague, but always there is the dark shadow of crime behind it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47442' title='47442'>One other neighbour I have met since I wrote last. </span>
<span sid='47443' title='47443'>This is Mr Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who lives some four miles to the south of us. </span>
<span sid='47444' title='47444'>He is an elderly man, red-faced, white-haired, and choleric. </span>
<span sid='47445' title='47445'>His passion is for the British law, and he has spent a large fortune in litigation. </span>
<span sid='47446' title='47446'>He fights for the mere pleasure of fighting, and is equally ready to take up either side of a question, so that it is no wonder that he has found it a costly amusement. </span>
<span sid='47447' title='47447'>Sometimes he will shut up a right of way and defy the parish to make him open it. </span>
<span sid='47448' title='47448'>At others he will with his own hands tear down some other man's gate and declare that a path has existed there from time immemorial, defying the owner to prosecute him for trespass. </span>
<span sid='47449' title='47449'>He is learned in old manorial and communal rights, and he applies his knowledge sometimes in favour of the villagers of Fernworthy and sometimes against them, so that he is periodically either carried in triumph down the village street or else burned in effigy, according to his latest exploit. </span>
<span sid='47450' title='47450'>He is said to have about seven lawsuits upon his hands at present, which will probably swallow up the remainder of his fortune, and so draw his sting and leave him harmless for the future. </span>
<span sid='47451' title='47451'>Apart from the law he seems a kindly, good-natured person, and I only mention him because you were particular that I should send some description of the people who surround us. </span>
<span sid='47452' title='47452'>He is curiously employed at present, for, being an amateur astronomer, he has an excellent telescope, with which he lies upon the roof of his own house and sweeps the moor all day in the hope of catching a glimpse of the escaped convict. </span>
<span sid='47453' title='47453'>If he would confine his energies to this all would be well, but there are rumours that he intends to prosecute Dr Mortimer for opening a grave without the consent of the next-of-kin, because he dug up the neolithic skull in the barrow on Long Down. </span>
<span sid='47454' title='47454'>He helps to keep our lives from being monotonous and gives a little comic relief where it is badly, needed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47455' title='47455'>And now, having brought you up to date on the escaped convict, the Stapletons, Dr Mortimer, and Frankland of Lafter Hall, let me end on that which is most important and tell you more about the Barrymores, and especially about the surprising development of last night.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47456' title='47456'>First of all about the test telegram, which you sent from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> in order to make sure that Barrymore was really here. </span>
<span sid='47457' title='47457'>I have already explained that the testimony of the postmaster shows that the test was worthless and that we have no proof one way or the other. </span>
<span sid='47458' title='47458'>I told Sir Henry how the matter stood, and he at once, in his downright fashion, had Barrymore up and asked him whether he had received the telegram himself. </span>
<span sid='47459' title='47459'>Barrymore said that he had.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47460' title='47460'>'Did the boy deliver it into your own hands?' asked Sir Henry.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47461' title='47461'>Barrymore looked surprised, and considered for a little time.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47462' title='47462'>'No,' said he, 'I was in the box-room at the time, and my wife brought it up to me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47463' title='47463'>'Did you answer it yourself ?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47464' title='47464'>'No, I told my wife what to answer, and she went down to write it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47465' title='47465'>In the evening he returned to the subject of his own accord.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47466' title='47466'>'I could not quite understand the object of your questions this morning, Sir Henry,' said he. </span>
<span sid='47467' title='47467'>'I trust that they do not mean that I have done anything to forfeit your confidence?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47468' title='47468'>Sir Henry had to assure him that it was not so and pacify him by giving him a considerable part of his old wardrobe, the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> outfit having now all arrived.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47469' title='47469'>Mrs Barrymore is of interest to me. </span>
<span sid='47470' title='47470'>She is a heavy, solid person, very limited, intensely respectable, and inclined to be puritanical. </span>
<span sid='47471' title='47471'>You could hardly conceive a less emotional subject. </span>
<span sid='47472' title='47472'>Yet I have told you how, on the first night here, I heard her sobbing bitterly, and since then I have more than once observed traces of tears upon her face. </span>
<span sid='47473' title='47473'>Some deep sorrow gnaws ever at her heart. </span>
<span sid='47474' title='47474'>Sometimes I wonder if she has a guilty memory which haunts her, and sometimes I suspect Barrymore of being a domestic tyrant. </span>
<span sid='47475' title='47475'>I have always felt that there was something singular and questionable in this man's character, but the adventure of last night brings all my suspicions to a head.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47476' title='47476'>And yet it may seem a small matter in itself. </span>
<span sid='47477' title='47477'>You are aware that I am not a very sound sleeper, and since I have been on guard in this house my slumbers have been lighter than ever. </span>
<span sid='47478' title='47478'>Last night, about two in the morning, I was aroused by a stealthy step passing my room. </span>
<span sid='47479' title='47479'>I rose, opened my door, and peeped out. </span>
<span sid='47480' title='47480'>A long black shadow was trailing down the corridor. </span>
<span sid='47481' title='47481'>It was thrown by a man who walked softly down the passage with a candle held in his hand. </span>
<span sid='47482' title='47482'>He was in shirt and trousers, with no covering to his feet. </span>
<span sid='47483' title='47483'>I could merely see the outline, but his height told me that it was Barrymore. </span>
<span sid='47484' title='47484'>He walked very slowly and circumspectly, and there was something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole appearance.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47485' title='47485'>I have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony which runs round the hall, but that it is resumed upon the farther side. </span>
<span sid='47486' title='47486'>I waited until he had passed out of sight, and then I followed him. </span>
<span sid='47487' title='47487'>When I came round the balcony he had reached the end of the farther corridor, and I could see from the glimmer of light through an open door that he had entered one of the rooms. </span>
<span sid='47488' title='47488'>Now, all these rooms are unfurnished and unoccupied, so that his expedition became more mysterious than ever. </span>
<span sid='47489' title='47489'>The light shone steadily, as if he were standing motionless. </span>
<span sid='47490' title='47490'>I crept down the passage as noiselessly as I could and peeped round the corner of the door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47491' title='47491'>Barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held against the glass. </span>
<span sid='47492' title='47492'>His profile was half turned towards me, and his face seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared out into the blackness of the moor. </span>
<span sid='47493' title='47493'>For some minutes he stood watching intently. </span>
<span sid='47494' title='47494'>Then he gave a deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out the light. </span>
<span sid='47495' title='47495'>Instantly I made my way back to my room, and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing once more upon their return journey. </span>
<span sid='47496' title='47496'>Long afterwards when I had fallen into a light sleep I heard a key turn somewhere in a lock, but I could not tell whence the sound came. </span>
<span sid='47497' title='47497'>What it all means I cannot guess, but there is some secret business going on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of. </span>
<span sid='47498' title='47498'>I do not trouble you with my theories, for you asked me to furnish you only with facts. </span>
<span sid='47499' title='47499'>I have had a long talk with Sir Henry this morning, and we have made a plan of campaign founded upon my observations of last night. </span>
<span sid='47500' title='47500'>I will not speak about it just now, but it should make my next report interesting reading.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47501' title='47501'>CHAPTER 9 : The Light upon the Moor</span>
<p>
<span sid='47502' title='47502'>[Second report of Dr Watson] Baskerville Hall, Oct. 15th</span>
<p>
<span sid='47503' title='47503'>My Dear Holmes, If I was compelled to leave you without much news during the early days of my mission you must acknowledge that I am making up for lost time, and that events are now crowding thick and fast upon us. </span>
<span sid='47504' title='47504'>In my last report I ended upon my top note with Barrymore at the window, and now I have quite a budget already which will, unless I am much mistaken, considerably surprise you. </span>
<span sid='47505' title='47505'>Things have taken a turn which I could not have anticipated. </span>
<span sid='47506' title='47506'>In some ways they have within the last forty-eight hours become much clearer and in some ways they have become more complicated. </span>
<span sid='47507' title='47507'>But I will tell you all and you shall judge for yourself.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47508' title='47508'>Before breakfast on the morning following my adventure I went down the corridor and examined the room in which Barrymore had been on the night before. </span>
<span sid='47509' title='47509'>The western window through which he had stared so intently has, I noticed, one peculiarity above all other windows in the house - it commands the nearest outlook on to the moor. </span>
<span sid='47510' title='47510'>There is an opening between two trees which enables one from this point of view to look right down upon it, while from all the other windows it is only a distant glimpse which can be obtained. </span>
<span sid='47511' title='47511'>It follows, therefore, that Barrymore, since only this window would serve his purpose, must have been looking out for something or somebody upon the moor. </span>
<span sid='47512' title='47512'>The night was very dark, so that I can hardly imagine how he could have hoped to see anyone. </span>
<span sid='47513' title='47513'>It had struck me that it was possible that some love intrigue was on foot. </span>
<span sid='47514' title='47514'>That would have accounted for his stealthy movements and also for the uneasiness of his wife. </span>
<span sid='47515' title='47515'>The man is a striking-looking fellow, very well equipped to steal the heart of a country girl, so that this theory seemed to have something to support it. </span>
<span sid='47516' title='47516'>That opening of the door which I had heard after I had returned to my room might mean that he had gone out to keep some clandestine appointment. </span>
<span sid='47517' title='47517'>So I reasoned with myself in the morning, and I tell you the direction of my suspicions, however much the result may have shown that they were unfounded.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47518' title='47518'>But whatever the true explanation of Barrymore's movements might be, I felt that the responsibility of keeping them to myself until could explain them was more than I could bear. </span>
<span sid='47519' title='47519'>I had an interview with the baronet in his study after breakfast, and I told him all that I had seen. </span>
<span sid='47520' title='47520'>He was less surprised than I had expected.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47521' title='47521'>'I knew that Barrymore walked about nights, and I had a mind to speak to him about it,' said he. </span>
<span sid='47522' title='47522'>'Two or three times I have heard his steps in the passage, coming and going, just about the hour you name.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47523' title='47523'>'Perhaps, then, he pays a visit every night to that particular window,' I suggested.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47524' title='47524'>'Perhaps he does. </span>
<span sid='47525' title='47525'>If so, we should be able to shadow him, and see what it is that he is after. </span>
<span sid='47526' title='47526'>I wonder what your friend Holmes would do if he were here?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47527' title='47527'>'I believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest,' said I. </span>
<span sid='47528' title='47528'>'He would follow Barrymore and see what he did.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47529' title='47529'>'Then we shall do it together.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47530' title='47530'>'But surely he would hear us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47531' title='47531'>'The man is rather deaf, and in any case we must take our chance of that. </span>
<span sid='47532' title='47532'>We'll sit up in my room tonight, and wait until he passes.' </span>
<span sid='47533' title='47533'>Sir Henry rubbed his hands with pleasure, and it was evident that he hailed the adventure as a relief to his somewhat quiet life upon the moor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47534' title='47534'>The baronet has been in communication with the architect who prepared the plans for Sir Charles, and with a contractor from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, so that we may expect great changes to begin here soon. </span>
<span sid='47535' title='47535'>There have been decorators and furnishers up from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Plymouth&t=h'>Plymouth</a>, and it is evident that our friend has large ideas, and means to spare no pains or expense to restore the grandeur of his family. </span>
<span sid='47536' title='47536'>When the house is renovated and refurnished, all that he will need will be a wife to make it complete. </span>
<span sid='47537' title='47537'>Between ourselves, there are pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady is willing, for I have seldom seen a man more infatuated with a woman than he is with our beautiful neighbour, Miss Stapleton. </span>
<span sid='47538' title='47538'>And yet the course of true love does not run quite as smoothly as one would under the circumstances expect. </span>
<span sid='47539' title='47539'>To-day, for example, its surface was broken by a very unexpected ripple, which has caused our friend considerable perplexity and annoyance.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47540' title='47540'>After the conversation which I have quoted about Barrymore, Sir Henry put on his hat and prepared to go out. </span>
<span sid='47541' title='47541'>As a matter of course I did the same.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47542' title='47542'>'What, are you coming, Watson?' he asked, looking at me in a curious way.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47543' title='47543'>'That depends on whether you are going on the moor,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47544' title='47544'>'Yes, I am.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47545' title='47545'>'Well, you know what my instructions are. </span>
<span sid='47546' title='47546'>I am sorry to intrude, but you heard how earnestly Holmes insisted that I should not leave you, and especially that you should not go alone upon the moor.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47547' title='47547'>Sir Henry put his hand upon my shoulder, with a pleasant smile.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47548' title='47548'>'My dear fellow,' said he, ' Holmes, with all his wisdom, did not foresee some things which have happened since I have been on the moor. </span>
<span sid='47549' title='47549'>You understand me? </span>
<span sid='47550' title='47550'>I am sure that you are the last man in the world who would wish to be a spoil-sport. </span>
<span sid='47551' title='47551'>I must go out alone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47552' title='47552'>It put me in a most awkward position. </span>
<span sid='47553' title='47553'>I was at a loss what to say or what to do, and before I had made up my mind he picked up his cane and was gone.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47554' title='47554'>But when I came to think the matter over my conscience reproached me bitterly for having on any pretext allowed him to go out of my sight. </span>
<span sid='47555' title='47555'>I imagined what my feelings would be if I had to return to you and to confess that some misfortune had occurred through my disregard for your instructions. </span>
<span sid='47556' title='47556'>I assure you my cheeks flushed at the very thought. </span>
<span sid='47557' title='47557'>It might not even now be too late to overtake him, so I set off at once in the direction of Merripit House.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47558' title='47558'>I hurried along the road at the top of my speed without seeing anything of Sir Henry, until I came to the point where the moor path branches off. </span>
<span sid='47559' title='47559'>There, fearing that perhaps I had come in the wrong direction, after all, I mounted a hill from which I could command a view - the same hill which is cut into the dark quarry. </span>
<span sid='47560' title='47560'>Then I saw him at once. </span>
<span sid='47561' title='47561'>He was on the moor path, about a quarter of a mile off, and a lady was by his side who could only be Miss Stapleton. </span>
<span sid='47562' title='47562'>It was dear that there was already an understanding between them and that they had met by appointment. </span>
<span sid='47563' title='47563'>They were walking slowly along in deep conversation, and I saw her making quick little movements of her hands as if she were very earnest in what she was saying, while he listened intently, and once or twice shook his head in strong dissent. </span>
<span sid='47564' title='47564'>I stood among the rocks watching them, very much puzzled as to what I should do next. </span>
<span sid='47565' title='47565'>To follow them and break into their intimate conversation seemed to be an outrage, and yet my clear duty was never for an instant to let him out of my sight. </span>
<span sid='47566' title='47566'>To act the spy upon a friend was a hateful task. </span>
<span sid='47567' title='47567'>Still, I could see no better course than to observe him from the hill, and to clear my conscience by confessing to him afterwards what I had done. </span>
<span sid='47568' title='47568'>It is true that if any sudden danger had threatened him I was too far away to be of use, and yet I am sure that you will agree with me that the position was very difficult, and that there was nothing more which I could do.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47569' title='47569'>Our friend, Sir Henry, and the lady had halted on the path and were standing deeply absorbed in their conversation, when I was suddenly aware that I was not the only witness of their interview. </span>
<span sid='47570' title='47570'>A wisp of green floating in the air caught my eye, and another glance showed me that it was carried on a stick by a man who was moving among the broken ground. </span>
<span sid='47571' title='47571'>It was Stapleton with his butterfly-net. </span>
<span sid='47572' title='47572'>He was very much closer to the pair than I was, and he appeared to be moving in their direction. </span>
<span sid='47573' title='47573'>At this instant Sir Henry suddenly drew Miss Stapleton to his side. </span>
<span sid='47574' title='47574'>His arm was round her, but it seemed to me that she was straining away from him with her face averted. </span>
<span sid='47575' title='47575'>He stooped his head to hers, and she raised one hand as if in protest. </span>
<span sid='47576' title='47576'>Next moment I saw them spring apart and turn hurriedly round. </span>
<span sid='47577' title='47577'>Stapleton was the cause of the interruption. </span>
<span sid='47578' title='47578'>He was running wildly towards them, his absurd net dangling behind him. </span>
<span sid='47579' title='47579'>He gesticulated and almost danced with excitement in front of the lovers. </span>
<span sid='47580' title='47580'>What the scene meant I could not imagine, but it seemed to me that Stapleton was abusing Sir Henry, who offered explanations, which became more angry as the other refused to accept them. </span>
<span sid='47581' title='47581'>The lady stood by in haughty silence. </span>
<span sid='47582' title='47582'>Finally Stapleton turned upon his heel and beckoned in a peremptory way to his sister, who, after an irresolute glance at Sir Henry, walked off by the side of her brother. </span>
<span sid='47583' title='47583'>The naturalist's angry gestures showed that the lady was included in his displeasure. </span>
<span sid='47584' title='47584'>The baronet stood for a minute looking after them, and then he walked slowly back the way that he had come, his head hanging, the very picture of dejection.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47585' title='47585'>What all this meant I could not imagine, but I was deeply ashamed to have witnessed so intimate a scene without my friend's knowledge. </span>
<span sid='47586' title='47586'>I ran down the hill, therefore, and met the baronet at the bottom. </span>
<span sid='47587' title='47587'>His face was flushed with anger and his brows were wrinkled, like one who is at his wits' ends what to do.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47588' title='47588'>'Hullo, Watson! </span>
<span sid='47589' title='47589'>Where have you dropped from?' said he. </span>
<span sid='47590' title='47590'>'You don't mean to say that you came after me in spite of all?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47591' title='47591'>I explained everything to him: how I had found it impossible to remain behind, how I had followed him, and how I had witnessed all that had occurred. </span>
<span sid='47592' title='47592'>For an instant his eyes blazed at me, but my frankness disarmed his anger, and he broke at last into a rather rueful laugh.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47593' title='47593'>'You would have thought the middle of that prairie a fairly safe place for a man to be private,' said he, 'but, by thunder, the whole country-side seems to have been out to see me do my wooing - and a mighty poor wooing at that! </span>
<span sid='47594' title='47594'>Where had you engaged a seat?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47595' title='47595'>'I was on that hill.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47596' title='47596'>'Quite in the back row, eh? </span>
<span sid='47597' title='47597'>But her brother was well up to the front. </span>
<span sid='47598' title='47598'>Did you see him come out on us?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47599' title='47599'>'Yes, I did.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47600' title='47600'>'Did he ever strike you as being crazy - this brother of hers?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47601' title='47601'>'I can't say that he ever did.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47602' title='47602'>'I dare say not. </span>
<span sid='47603' title='47603'>I always thought him sane enough until to-day, but You can take it from me that either he or I ought to be in a strait-jacket. </span>
<span sid='47604' title='47604'>What's the matter with me, anyhow? </span>
<span sid='47605' title='47605'>You've lived near me for some weeks, Watson. </span>
<span sid='47606' title='47606'>Tell me straight, now! </span>
<span sid='47607' title='47607'>Is there anything that would prevent me from making a good husband to a woman that I loved?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47608' title='47608'>'I should say not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47609' title='47609'>'He can't object to my worldly position, so it must be myself that he has this down on. </span>
<span sid='47610' title='47610'>What has he against me? </span>
<span sid='47611' title='47611'>I never hurt man or woman in my life that I know of. </span>
<span sid='47612' title='47612'>And yet he would not so much as let me touch the tips of her fingers.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47613' title='47613'>'Did he say so?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47614' title='47614'>'That, and a deal more. </span>
<span sid='47615' title='47615'>I tell you, Watson, I've only known her these few weeks, but from the first I just felt that she was made for me, and she, too - she was happy when she was with me, and that I'll swear. </span>
<span sid='47616' title='47616'>There's a light in a woman's eyes that speaks louder than words. </span>
<span sid='47617' title='47617'>But he has never let us get together, and it was only to-day for the first time that I saw a chance of having a few words with her alone. </span>
<span sid='47618' title='47618'>She was glad to meet me, but when she did it was not love that she would talk about, and she wouldn't let me talk about it either if she could have stopped it. </span>
<span sid='47619' title='47619'>She kept coming back to it that this was a place of danger, and that she would never be happy until I had left it. </span>
<span sid='47620' title='47620'>I told her that since I had seen her I was in no hurry to leave it, and that if she really wanted me to go, the only way to work it was for her to arrange to go with me. </span>
<span sid='47621' title='47621'>With that I offered in as many words to marry her, but before she could answer down came this brother of hers, running at us with a face on him like a madman. </span>
<span sid='47622' title='47622'>He was just white with rage, and those light eyes of his were blazing with fury. </span>
<span sid='47623' title='47623'>What was I doing with the lady? </span>
<span sid='47624' title='47624'>How dared I offer her attentions which were distasteful to her? </span>
<span sid='47625' title='47625'>Did I think that because I was a baronet I could do what I liked? </span>
<span sid='47626' title='47626'>If he had not been her brother I should have known better how to answer him. </span>
<span sid='47627' title='47627'>As it was I told him that my feelings towards his sister were such as I was not ashamed of, and that I hoped that she might honour me by becoming my wife. </span>
<span sid='47628' title='47628'>That seemed to make the matter no better, so then I lost my temper too, and I answered him rather more hotly than I should, perhaps, considering that she was standing by. </span>
<span sid='47629' title='47629'>So it ended by his going off with her, as you saw, and here am I as badly puzzled a man as any in this county. </span>
<span sid='47630' title='47630'>Just tell me what it all means, Watson, and I'll owe you more than ever I can hope to pay.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47631' title='47631'>I tried one or two explanations, but, indeed, I was completely puzzled myself. </span>
<span sid='47632' title='47632'>Our friend's title, his fortune, his age, his character, and his appearance are all in his favour, and I know nothing against him, unless it be this dark fate which runs in his family. </span>
<span sid='47633' title='47633'>That his advances should be rejected so brusquely without any reference to the lady's own wishes, and that the lady should accept the situation without protest, is very amazing. </span>
<span sid='47634' title='47634'>However, our conjectures were set at rest by a visit from Stapleton himself that very afternoon. </span>
<span sid='47635' title='47635'>He had come to offer apologies for his rudeness of the morning, and after a long private interview with Sir Henry in his study the upshot of their conversation was that the breach is quite healed, and that we are to dine at Merripit House next Friday as a sign of it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47636' title='47636'>'I don't say now that he isn't a crazy man,' said Sir Henry, 'I can't forget the look in his eyes when he ran at me this morning, but I must allow that no man could make a more handsome apology than he has done.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47637' title='47637'>'Did he give any explanation of his conduct?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47638' title='47638'>'His sister is everything in his life, he says. </span>
<span sid='47639' title='47639'>That is natural enough, and I am glad that he should understand her value. </span>
<span sid='47640' title='47640'>They have always been together, and according to his account he has been a very lonely man with only her as a companion, so that the thought of losing her was really terrible to him. </span>
<span sid='47641' title='47641'>He had not understood, he said, that I was becoming attached to her, but when he saw with his own eyes that it was really so, and that she might be taken away from him, it gave him such a shock that for a time he was not responsible for what he said or did. </span>
<span sid='47642' title='47642'>He was very sorry for all that had passed, and he recognized how foolish and how selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold a beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life. </span>
<span sid='47643' title='47643'>If she had to leave him he had rather it was to a neighbour like myself than to anyone else. </span>
<span sid='47644' title='47644'>But in any case it was a blow to him, and it would take him some time before he could prepare himself to meet it. </span>
<span sid='47645' title='47645'>He would withdraw all opposition upon his part if I would promise for three months to let the matter rest, and to be content with cultivating the lady's friendship during that time without claiming her love. </span>
<span sid='47646' title='47646'>This I promised, and so the matter rests.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47647' title='47647'>So there is one of our small mysteries cleared up. </span>
<span sid='47648' title='47648'>It is something to have touched bottom anywhere in this bog in which we are floundering. </span>
<span sid='47649' title='47649'>We know now why Stapleton looked with disfavour upon his sister's suitor - even when that suitor was so eligible a one as Sir Henry. </span>
<span sid='47650' title='47650'>And now I pass on to another thread which I have extricated out of the tangled skein, the mystery of the sobs in the night, of the tear-stained face of Mrs Barrymore, of the secret journey of the butler to the western lattice-window. </span>
<span sid='47651' title='47651'>Congratulate me, my dear Holmes, and tell me that I have not disappointed you as an agent - that you do not regret the confidence which you showed in me when you sent me down. </span>
<span sid='47652' title='47652'>All these things have by one night's work been thoroughly cleared.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47653' title='47653'>I have said 'by one night's work', but, in truth, it was by two nights' work, for on the first we drew entirely blank. </span>
<span sid='47654' title='47654'>I sat up with Sir Henry in his room until nearly three o'clock in the morning, but no sound of any sort did we hear except the chiming clock upon the stairs. </span>
<span sid='47655' title='47655'>It was a most melancholy vigil, and ended by each of us falling asleep in our chairs. </span>
<span sid='47656' title='47656'>Fortunately we were not discouraged, and we determined to try again. </span>
<span sid='47657' title='47657'>The next night we lowered the lamp and sat smoking cigarettes, without making the least sound. </span>
<span sid='47658' title='47658'>It was incredible how slowly the hours crawled by, and yet we were helped through it by the same sort of patient interest which the hunter must feel as he watches the trap into which he hopes the game may wander. </span>
<span sid='47659' title='47659'>One struck, and two, and we had almost for the second time given it up in despair, when in an instant we both sat bolt upright in our chairs, with all our weary senses keenly on the alert once more. </span>
<span sid='47660' title='47660'>We had heard the creak of a step in the passage.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47661' title='47661'>Very stealthily we heard it pass along until it died away in the distance. </span>
<span sid='47662' title='47662'>Then the baronet gently opened his door, and we set out in pursuit. </span>
<span sid='47663' title='47663'>Already our man had gone round the gallery, and the corridor was all in darkness. </span>
<span sid='47664' title='47664'>Softly we stole along until we had come into the other wing. </span>
<span sid='47665' title='47665'>We were just in time to catch a glimpse of the tall, black-bearded figure, his shoulders rounded, as he tip-toed down the passage. </span>
<span sid='47666' title='47666'>Then he passed through the same door as before, and the light of the candle framed it in the darkness and shot one single yellow beam across the gloom of the corridor. </span>
<span sid='47667' title='47667'>We shuffled cautiously towards it, trying every plank before we dared to put our whole weight upon it. </span>
<span sid='47668' title='47668'>We had taken the precaution of leaving our boots behind us, but, even so, the old boards snapped and creaked beneath our tread. </span>
<span sid='47669' title='47669'>Sometimes it seemed impossible that he should fail to hear our approach. </span>
<span sid='47670' title='47670'>However, the man is fortunately rather deaf, and he was entirely preoccupied in that which he was doing. </span>
<span sid='47671' title='47671'>When at last we reached the door and peeped through we found him crouching at the window, candle in hand, his white, intent face pressed against the pane, exactly as I had seen him two nights before.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47672' title='47672'>We had arranged no plan of campaign, but the baronet is a man to whom the most direct way is always the most natural. </span>
<span sid='47673' title='47673'>He walked into the room, and as he did so Barrymore sprang up from the window with a sharp hiss of his breath, and stood, livid and trembling, before us. </span>
<span sid='47674' title='47674'>His dark eyes, glaring out of the white mask of his face, were full of horror and astonishment as he gazed from Sir Henry to me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47675' title='47675'>'What are you doing here, Barrymore?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47676' title='47676'>'Nothing, sir.' </span>
<span sid='47677' title='47677'>His agitation was so great that he could hardly speak, and the shadows sprang up and down from the shaking of his candle. </span>
<span sid='47678' title='47678'>'It was the window, sir. </span>
<span sid='47679' title='47679'>I go round at night to see that they are fastened.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47680' title='47680'>'On the second floor?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47681' title='47681'>'Yes, sir, all the windows.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47682' title='47682'>'Look here, Barrymore,' said Sir Henry, sternly, 'we have made up our minds to have the truth out of you, so it will save you trouble to tell it sooner rather than later. </span>
<span sid='47683' title='47683'>Come, now! </span>
<span sid='47684' title='47684'>No lies! </span>
<span sid='47685' title='47685'>What were you doing at that window?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47686' title='47686'>The fellow looked at us in a helpless way, and he wrung his hands together like one who is in the last extremity of doubt and misery.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47687' title='47687'>'I was doing no harm, sir. </span>
<span sid='47688' title='47688'>I was holding a candle to the window.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47689' title='47689'>'And why were you holding a candle to the window?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47690' title='47690'>'Don't ask me, Sir Henry - don't ask me! </span>
<span sid='47691' title='47691'>I give you my word, sir, that it is not my secret, and that I cannot tell it. </span>
<span sid='47692' title='47692'>If it concerned no one but myself I would not try to keep it from you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47693' title='47693'>A sudden idea occurred to me, and I took the candle from the window-sill, where the butler had placed it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47694' title='47694'>'He must have been holding it as a signal,' said I. </span>
<span sid='47695' title='47695'>'Let us see if there is any answer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47696' title='47696'>I held it as he had done, and stared out into the darkness of the night. </span>
<span sid='47697' title='47697'>Vaguely I could discern the black bank of the trees and the lighter expanse of the moor, for the moon was behind the clouds. </span>
<span sid='47698' title='47698'>And then I gave a cry of exultation, for a tiny pin-point of yellow light had suddenly transfixed the dark veil, and glowed steadily in the centre of the black square framed by the window.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47699' title='47699'>'There it is!' I cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47700' title='47700'>'No, no, sir, it is nothing - nothing at all,' the butler broke in, 'I assure you, sir-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47701' title='47701'>'Move your light across the window, Watson!' cried the baronet. </span>
<span sid='47702' title='47702'>'See, the other moves also! </span>
<span sid='47703' title='47703'>Now, you rascal, do you deny that it is a signal? </span>
<span sid='47704' title='47704'>Come, speak up! </span>
<span sid='47705' title='47705'>Who is your confederate out yonder, and what is this conspiracy that is going on?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47706' title='47706'>The man's face became openly defiant.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47707' title='47707'>'It is my business, and not yours. </span>
<span sid='47708' title='47708'>I will not tell.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47709' title='47709'>'Then you leave my employment right away.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47710' title='47710'>'Very good, sir. </span>
<span sid='47711' title='47711'>If I must, I must.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47712' title='47712'>'And you go in disgrace. </span>
<span sid='47713' title='47713'>By thunder, you may well be ashamed of yourself. </span>
<span sid='47714' title='47714'>Your family has lived with mine for over a hundred years under this roof, and here I find you deep in some dark plot against me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47715' title='47715'>'No, no, sir, no, not against you!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47716' title='47716'>It was a woman's voice, and Mrs Barrymore, paler and more horror-struck than her husband, was standing at the door. </span>
<span sid='47717' title='47717'>Her bulky figure in a shawl and skirt might have been comic were it not for the intensity of feeling upon her face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47718' title='47718'>'We have to go, Eliza. </span>
<span sid='47719' title='47719'>This is the end of it. </span>
<span sid='47720' title='47720'>You can pack our things,' said the butler.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47721' title='47721'>'Oh, John, John, have I brought you to this? </span>
<span sid='47722' title='47722'>It is my doing, Sir Henry - all mine. </span>
<span sid='47723' title='47723'>He has done nothing except for my sake, and because I asked him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47724' title='47724'>'Speak out, then! </span>
<span sid='47725' title='47725'>What does it mean?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47726' title='47726'>'My unhappy brother is starving on the moor. </span>
<span sid='47727' title='47727'>We cannot let him perish at our very gates. </span>
<span sid='47728' title='47728'>The light is a signal to him that food is ready for him, and his light out yonder is to show the spot to which to bring it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47729' title='47729'>'Then your brother is-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47730' title='47730'>'The escaped convict, sir - Selden, the criminal.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47731' title='47731'>'That's the truth, sir,' said Barrymore. </span>
<span sid='47732' title='47732'>'I said that it was not my secret, and that I could not tell it to you. </span>
<span sid='47733' title='47733'>But now you have heard it, and you will see that if there was a plot it was not against you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47734' title='47734'>This, then, was the explanation of the stealthy expeditions at night and the light at the window. </span>
<span sid='47735' title='47735'>Sir Henry and I both stared at the woman in amazement. </span>
<span sid='47736' title='47736'>Was it possible that this stolidly respectable person was of the same blood as one of the most notorious criminals in the country?</span>
<p>
<span sid='47737' title='47737'>'Yes, sir, my name was Selden, and he is my younger brother. </span>
<span sid='47738' title='47738'>We humoured him too much when he was a lad, and gave him his own way in everything, until he came to think that the world was made for his pleasure, and that he could do what he liked in it. </span>
<span sid='47739' title='47739'>Then, as he grew older, he met wicked companions, and the devil entered into him until he broke my mother's heart and dragged our name in the dirt. </span>
<span sid='47740' title='47740'>From crime to crime he sank lower and lower, until it is only the mercy of God which has snatched him from the scaffold, but to me, sir, he was always the little curly-headed boy that I had nursed and played with, as an elder sister would. </span>
<span sid='47741' title='47741'>That was why he broke prison, sir. </span>
<span sid='47742' title='47742'>He knew that I was here, and that we could not refuse to help him. </span>
<span sid='47743' title='47743'>When he dragged himself here one night, weary and starving, with the warders hard at his heels, what could we do? </span>
<span sid='47744' title='47744'>We took him in and fed him and cared for him. </span>
<span sid='47745' title='47745'>Then you returned, sir, and my brother thought he would be safer on the moor than anywhere else until the hue and cry was over, so he lay in hiding there. </span>
<span sid='47746' title='47746'>But every second night we made sure if he was still there by putting a light in the window, and if there was an answer my husband took out some bread and meat to him. </span>
<span sid='47747' title='47747'>Every day we hoped that he was gone, but as long as he was there we could not desert him. </span>
<span sid='47748' title='47748'>That is the whole truth, as I am an honest Christian woman, and you will see that if there is blame in the matter it does not lie with my husband, but with me, for whose sake he has done all that he has.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47749' title='47749'>The woman's words came with an intense earnestness which carried conviction with them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47750' title='47750'>'Is this true, Barrymore?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47751' title='47751'>'Yes, Sir Henry. </span>
<span sid='47752' title='47752'>Every word of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47753' title='47753'>'Well, I cannot blame you for standing by your own wife. </span>
<span sid='47754' title='47754'>Forget what I have said. </span>
<span sid='47755' title='47755'>Go to your room, you two, and we shall talk further about this matter in the morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47756' title='47756'>When they were gone we looked out of the window again. </span>
<span sid='47757' title='47757'>Sir Henry had flung it open, and the cold night wind beat in upon our faces. </span>
<span sid='47758' title='47758'>Far away in the black distance there still glowed that one tiny point of yellow light.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47759' title='47759'>'I wonder he dares,' said Sir Henry.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47760' title='47760'>'It may be so placed as to be only visible from here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47761' title='47761'>'Very likely. </span>
<span sid='47762' title='47762'>How far do you think it is?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47763' title='47763'>'Out by the Cleft Tor, I think.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47764' title='47764'>'Not more than a mile or two off.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47765' title='47765'>'Hardly that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47766' title='47766'>'Well, it cannot be far if Barrymore had to carry out the food to it. </span>
<span sid='47767' title='47767'>And he is waiting, this villain, beside that candle. </span>
<span sid='47768' title='47768'>By thunder, Watson, I am going out to take that man!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47769' title='47769'>The same thought had crossed my own mind. </span>
<span sid='47770' title='47770'>It was not as if the Barrymores had taken us into their confidence. </span>
<span sid='47771' title='47771'>Their secret had been forced from them. </span>
<span sid='47772' title='47772'>The man was a danger to the community, an unmitigated scoundrel for whom there was neither pity nor excuse. </span>
<span sid='47773' title='47773'>We were only doing our duty in taking this chance of putting him back where he could do no harm. </span>
<span sid='47774' title='47774'>With his brutal and violent nature, others would have to pay the price if we held our hands. </span>
<span sid='47775' title='47775'>Any night, for example, our neighbours the Stapletons might be attacked by him, and it may have been the thought of this which made Sir Henry so keen upon the adventure.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47776' title='47776'>'I will come,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47777' title='47777'>'Then get your revolver and put on your boots. </span>
<span sid='47778' title='47778'>The sooner we start the better, as the fellow may put out his light and be off.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47779' title='47779'>In five minutes we were outside the door, starting upon our expedition. </span>
<span sid='47780' title='47780'>We hurried through the dark shrubbery, amid the dull moaning of the autumn wind and the rustle of the failing leaves. </span>
<span sid='47781' title='47781'>The night-air was heavy with the smell of damp and decay. </span>
<span sid='47782' title='47782'>Now and again the moon peeped out for an instant, but clouds were driving over the face of the sky, and just as we came out on the moor a thin rain began to fall. </span>
<span sid='47783' title='47783'>The light still burned steadily in front. </span>
<span sid='47784' title='47784'>'Are you armed?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47785' title='47785'>'I have a hunting-crop.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47786' title='47786'>'We must close in on him rapidly, for he is said to be a desperate fellow. </span>
<span sid='47787' title='47787'>We shall take him by surprise and have him at our mercy before he can resist.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47788' title='47788'>'I say, Watson,' said the baronet, 'what would Holmes say to this? </span>
<span sid='47789' title='47789'>How about that hour of darkness in which the power of evil is exalted?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47790' title='47790'>As if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vast gloom of the moor that strange cry which I had already heard upon the borders of the great Grimpen Mire. </span>
<span sid='47791' title='47791'>It came with the wind through the silence of the night, a long, deep mutter, then a rising howl, and then the sad moan in which it died away. </span>
<span sid='47792' title='47792'>Again and again it sounded, the whole air throbbing with it, strident, wild, and menacing. </span>
<span sid='47793' title='47793'>The baronet caught my sleeve, and his face glimmered white through the darkness.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47794' title='47794'>'Good heavens, what's that, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47795' title='47795'>'I don't know. </span>
<span sid='47796' title='47796'>It's a sound they have on the moor. </span>
<span sid='47797' title='47797'>I heard it once before.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47798' title='47798'>It died away, and an absolute silence closed in upon us. </span>
<span sid='47799' title='47799'>We stood straining our ears, but nothing came.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47800' title='47800'>' Watson,' said the baronet, 'it was the cry of a hound.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47801' title='47801'>My blood ran cold in my veins, for there was a break in his voice which told of the sudden horror which had seized him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47802' title='47802'>'What do they call this sound?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47803' title='47803'>'Who?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47804' title='47804'>'The folk on the country-side.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47805' title='47805'>'Oh, they are ignorant people. </span>
<span sid='47806' title='47806'>Why should you mind what they call it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47807' title='47807'>'Tell me, Watson. </span>
<span sid='47808' title='47808'>What do they say of it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47809' title='47809'>I hesitated, but could not escape the question.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47810' title='47810'>'They say it is the cry of the Hound of the Baskervilles.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47811' title='47811'>He groaned, and was silent for a few moments.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47812' title='47812'>'A hound it was,' he said at last, 'but it seemed to come from miles away over yonder, I think.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47813' title='47813'>'It was hard to say whence it came.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47814' title='47814'>'It rose and fell with the wind. </span>
<span sid='47815' title='47815'>Isn't that the direction of the great Grimpen Mire?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47816' title='47816'>'Yes, it is.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47817' title='47817'>'Well, it was up there. </span>
<span sid='47818' title='47818'>Come now, Watson, didn't you think yourself that it was the cry of a hound? </span>
<span sid='47819' title='47819'>I am not a child. </span>
<span sid='47820' title='47820'>You need not fear to speak the truth.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47821' title='47821'>'Stapleton was with me when I heard it last. </span>
<span sid='47822' title='47822'>He said that it might be the calling of a strange bird.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47823' title='47823'>'No, no, it was a hound. </span>
<span sid='47824' title='47824'>My God, can there be some truth in all these stories? </span>
<span sid='47825' title='47825'>Is it possible that I am really in danger from so dark a cause? </span>
<span sid='47826' title='47826'>You don't believe it, do you, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47827' title='47827'>'No, no.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47828' title='47828'>'And yet it was one thing to laugh about it in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, and it is another to stand out here in the darkness of the moor and to hear such a cry as that. </span>
<span sid='47829' title='47829'>And my uncle! </span>
<span sid='47830' title='47830'>There was the footprint of the hound beside him as he lay. </span>
<span sid='47831' title='47831'>It all fits together. </span>
<span sid='47832' title='47832'>I don't think that I am a coward, Watson, but that sound seemed to freeze my very blood. </span>
<span sid='47833' title='47833'>Feel my hand!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47834' title='47834'>It was as cold as a block of marble.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47835' title='47835'>'You'll be all right to-morrow.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47836' title='47836'>'I don't think I'll get that cry out of my head. </span>
<span sid='47837' title='47837'>What do you advise that we do now?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47838' title='47838'>'Shall we turn back?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47839' title='47839'>'No, by thunder, we have come out to get our man, and we will do it. </span>
<span sid='47840' title='47840'>We are after the convict, and a hell-hound, as likely as not, after us. </span>
<span sid='47841' title='47841'>Come on. </span>
<span sid='47842' title='47842'>We'll see it through if all the fiends of the pit were loose upon the moor.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47843' title='47843'>We stumbled slowly along in the darkness, with the black loom of the craggy hills around us, and the yellow speck of light burning steadily in front. </span>
<span sid='47844' title='47844'>There is nothing so deceptive as the distance of a light upon a pitch-dark night, and sometimes the glimmer seemed to be far away upon the horizon and sometimes it might have been within a few yards of us. </span>
<span sid='47845' title='47845'>But at last we could see whence it came, and then we knew that we were indeed very close. </span>
<span sid='47846' title='47846'>A guttering candle was stuck in a crevice of the rocks which flanked it on each side so as to keep the wind from it, and also to prevent it from being visible, save in the direction of Baskerville Hall. </span>
<span sid='47847' title='47847'>A boulder of granite concealed our approach, and crouching behind it we gazed over it at the signal light. </span>
<span sid='47848' title='47848'>It was strange to see this single candle burning there in the middle of the moor, with no sign of life near it - just the one straight yellow flame and the gleam of the rock on each side of it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47849' title='47849'>'What shall we do now?' whispered Sir Henry.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47850' title='47850'>'Wait here. </span>
<span sid='47851' title='47851'>He must be near his light. </span>
<span sid='47852' title='47852'>Let us see if we can get a glimpse of him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47853' title='47853'>The words were hardly out of my mouth when we both saw him. </span>
<span sid='47854' title='47854'>Over the rocks, in the crevice of which the candle burned, there was thrust out an evil yellow face, a terrible animal face, all seamed and scored with vile passions. </span>
<span sid='47855' title='47855'>Foul with mire, with a bristling beard, and hung with matted hair, it might well have belonged to one of those old savages who dwelt in the burrows on the hill-sides. </span>
<span sid='47856' title='47856'>The light beneath him was reflected in his small, cunning eyes, which peered fiercely to right and left through the darkness, like a crafty and savage animal who has heard the steps of the hunters.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47857' title='47857'>Something had evidently aroused his suspicions. </span>
<span sid='47858' title='47858'>It may have been that Barrymore had some private signal which we had neglected to give, or the fellow may have had some other reason for thinking that all was not well, but I could read his fears upon his wicked face. </span>
<span sid='47859' title='47859'>Any instant he might dash out the light and vanish in the darkness. </span>
<span sid='47860' title='47860'>I sprang forward, therefore, and Sir Henry did the same. </span>
<span sid='47861' title='47861'>At the same moment the convict screamed out a curse at us and hurled a rock which splintered up against the boulder which had sheltered us. </span>
<span sid='47862' title='47862'>I caught one glimpse of his short, squat, strongly-built figure as he sprang to his feet and turned to run. </span>
<span sid='47863' title='47863'>At the same moment by a lucky chance the moon broke through the clouds. </span>
<span sid='47864' title='47864'>We rushed over the brow of the hill, and there was our man running with great speed down the other side, springing over the stones in his way with the activity of a mountain goat. </span>
<span sid='47865' title='47865'>A lucky long shot of my revolver might have crippled him, but I had brought it only to defend myself if attacked, and not to shoot an unarmed man who was running away.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47866' title='47866'>We were both fair runners and in good condition, but we soon found that we had no chance of overtaking him. </span>
<span sid='47867' title='47867'>We saw him for a long time in the moonlight until he was only a small speck moving swiftly among the boulders upon the side of a distant hill. </span>
<span sid='47868' title='47868'>We ran and ran until we were completely blown, but the space between us grew ever wider. </span>
<span sid='47869' title='47869'>Finally we stopped and sat panting on two rocks, while we watched him disappearing in the distance.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47870' title='47870'>And it was at this moment that there occurred a most strange and unexpected thing. </span>
<span sid='47871' title='47871'>We had risen from our rocks and were turning to go home, having abandoned the hopeless chase. </span>
<span sid='47872' title='47872'>The moon was low upon the right, and the jagged pinnacle of a granite tor stood up against the lower curve of its silver disc. </span>
<span sid='47873' title='47873'>There, outlined as black as an ebony statue on that shining background, I saw the figure of a man upon the tor. </span>
<span sid='47874' title='47874'>Do not think that it was a delusion, Holmes. </span>
<span sid='47875' title='47875'>I assure you that I have never in my life seen anything more clearly. </span>
<span sid='47876' title='47876'>As far as I could judge, the figure was that of a tall, thin man. </span>
<span sid='47877' title='47877'>He stood with his legs a little separated, his arms folded, his head bowed, as if he were brooding over that enormous wilderness of peat and granite which lay behind him. </span>
<span sid='47878' title='47878'>He might have been the very spirit of that terrible place. </span>
<span sid='47879' title='47879'>It was not the convict. </span>
<span sid='47880' title='47880'>This man was far from the place where the latter had disappeared. </span>
<span sid='47881' title='47881'>Besides, he was a much taller man. </span>
<span sid='47882' title='47882'>With a cry of surprise I pointed him out to the baronet, but in the instant during which I had turned to grasp his arm the man was gone. </span>
<span sid='47883' title='47883'>There was the sharp pinnacle of granite still cutting the lower edge of the moon, but its peak bore no trace of that silent and motionless figure.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47884' title='47884'>I wished to go in that direction and to search the tor, but it was some distance away. </span>
<span sid='47885' title='47885'>The Baronet's nerves were still quivering from that cry, which recalled the dark story of his family, and he was not in the mood for fresh adventures. </span>
<span sid='47886' title='47886'>He had not seen this lonely man upon the tor, and could not feel the thrill which his strange presence and his commanding attitude had given to me. </span>
<span sid='47887' title='47887'>'A warder, no doubt,' said he. </span>
<span sid='47888' title='47888'>'The moor has been thick with them since this fellow escaped.' </span>
<span sid='47889' title='47889'>Well, perhaps his explanation may be the right one, but I should like to have some further proof of it. </span>
<span sid='47890' title='47890'>To-day we mean to communicate to the Princetown people where they should look for their missing man, but it is hard lines that we have not actually had the triumph of bringing him back as our own prisoner. </span>
<span sid='47891' title='47891'>Such are the adventures of last night, and you must acknowledge, my dear Holmes, that I have done you very well in the matter of a report. </span>
<span sid='47892' title='47892'>Much of what I tell you is no doubt quite irrelevant, but still I feel that it is best that I should let you have all the facts and leave you to select for yourself those which will be of most service to you in helping you to your conclusions. </span>
<span sid='47893' title='47893'>We are certainly making some progress. </span>
<span sid='47894' title='47894'>So far as the Barrymores go, we have found the motive of their actions, and that has cleared up the situation very much. </span>
<span sid='47895' title='47895'>But the moor with its mysteries and its strange inhabitants remains as inscrutable as ever. </span>
<span sid='47896' title='47896'>Perhaps in my next I may be able to throw some light upon this also. </span>
<span sid='47897' title='47897'>Best of all would it be if you could come down to us. </span>
<span sid='47898' title='47898'>[In any case you will hear from me again in the course of the next few days.]</span>
<p>
<span sid='47899' title='47899'>CHAPTER 10 : Extract from the Diary of Dr Watson</span>
<p>
<span sid='47900' title='47900'>So far I have been able to quote from the reports which I have forwarded during these early days to Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='47901' title='47901'>Now, however, I have arrived at a point in my narrative where I am compelled to abandon this method and to trust once more to my recollections, aided by the diary which I kept at the time. </span>
<span sid='47902' title='47902'>A few extracts from the latter will carry me on to those scenes which are indelibly fixed in every detail upon my memory. </span>
<span sid='47903' title='47903'>I proceed, then, from the morning which followed our abortive chase of the convict and our other strange experiences upon the moor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47904' title='47904'>October 16th - A dull and foggy day, with a drizzle of rain. </span>
<span sid='47905' title='47905'>The house is banked in with rolling clouds, which rise now and then to show the dreary curves of the moor, with thin, silver veins upon the sides of the hills, and the distant boulders gleaming where the light strikes upon their wet faces. </span>
<span sid='47906' title='47906'>It is melancholy outside and in. </span>
<span sid='47907' title='47907'>The baronet is in a black reaction after the excitements of the night. </span>
<span sid='47908' title='47908'>I am conscious myself of a weight at my heart and a feeling of impending danger - ever-present, which is the more terrible because I am unable to define it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47909' title='47909'>And have I not cause for such a feeling? </span>
<span sid='47910' title='47910'>Consider the long sequence of incidents which have all pointed to some sinister influence which is at work around us. </span>
<span sid='47911' title='47911'>There is the death of the last occupant of the Hall, fulfilling so exactly the conditions of the family legend, and there are the repeated reports from peasants of the appearance of a strange creature upon the moor. </span>
<span sid='47912' title='47912'>Twice I have with my own ears heard the sound which resembled the distant, baying of a hound. </span>
<span sid='47913' title='47913'>It is incredible, impossible, that it should really be outside the ordinary laws of Nature. </span>
<span sid='47914' title='47914'>A spectral hound which leaves material footmarks and fills the air with its howling is surely not to be thought of. </span>
<span sid='47915' title='47915'>Stapleton may fall in with such a superstition, and Mortimer also, but if I have one quality upon earth it is common sense, and nothing will persuade me to believe in such a thing. </span>
<span sid='47916' title='47916'>To do so would be to descend to the level of these poor peasants who are not content with a mere fiend-dog, but must needs describe him with hell-fire shooting from his mouth and eyes. </span>
<span sid='47917' title='47917'>Holmes would not listen to such fancies, and I am his agent. </span>
<span sid='47918' title='47918'>But facts are facts, and I have twice heard this crying upon the moor. </span>
<span sid='47919' title='47919'>Suppose that there were really some huge hound loose upon it, that would go far to explain everything. </span>
<span sid='47920' title='47920'>But where could such a hound lie concealed, where did it get its food, where did it come from, how was it that no one saw it by day?</span>
<p>
<span sid='47921' title='47921'>It must be confessed that the natural explanation offers almost as many difficulties as the other. </span>
<span sid='47922' title='47922'>And always, apart from the hound, there was the fact of the human agency in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, the man in the cab, and the letter which warned Sir Henry against the moor. </span>
<span sid='47923' title='47923'>This at least was real, but it might have been the work of a protecting friend as easily as an enemy. </span>
<span sid='47924' title='47924'>Where was that friend or enemy now? </span>
<span sid='47925' title='47925'>Had he remained in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, or had he followed us down here? </span>
<span sid='47926' title='47926'>Could he - could he be the stranger whom I had seen upon the Tor?</span>
<p>
<span sid='47927' title='47927'>It is true that I have had only the one glance at him, and yet there are some things to which I am ready to swear. </span>
<span sid='47928' title='47928'>He is no one whom I have seen down here, and I have now met all the neighbours. </span>
<span sid='47929' title='47929'>The figure was far taller than that of Stapleton, far thinner than that of Frankland. </span>
<span sid='47930' title='47930'>Barrymore it might possibly have been, but we had left him behind us, and I am certain that he could not have followed us. </span>
<span sid='47931' title='47931'>A stranger then is still dogging us, just as a stranger had dogged us in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='47932' title='47932'>We have never shaken him off. </span>
<span sid='47933' title='47933'>If I could lay my hands upon that man, then at last we might find ourselves at the end of all our difficulties. </span>
<span sid='47934' title='47934'>To this one purpose I must now devote all my energies.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47935' title='47935'>My first impulse was to tell Sir Henry all my plans. </span>
<span sid='47936' title='47936'>My second and wisest one is to play my own game and speak as little as possible to anyone. </span>
<span sid='47937' title='47937'>He is silent and distrait. </span>
<span sid='47938' title='47938'>His nerves have been strangely shaken by that sound upon the moor. </span>
<span sid='47939' title='47939'>I will say nothing to add to his anxieties, but I will take my own steps to attain my own end.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47940' title='47940'>We had a small scene this morning after breakfast. </span>
<span sid='47941' title='47941'>Barrymore asked leave to speak with Sir Henry, and they were closeted in his study some little time. </span>
<span sid='47942' title='47942'>Sitting in the billiard-room, I more than once heard the sound of voices raised, and I had a pretty good idea what the point was which was under discussion. </span>
<span sid='47943' title='47943'>After a time the Baronet opened his door and called for me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47944' title='47944'>'Barrymore considers that he has a grievance,' he said. </span>
<span sid='47945' title='47945'>'He thinks that it was unfair on our part to hunt his brother-in-law down when he, of his own free will, had told us the secret.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47946' title='47946'>The butler was standing, very pale but very collected, before us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47947' title='47947'>'I may have spoken too warmly, sir,' said he, 'and if I have I am sure that I beg your pardon. </span>
<span sid='47948' title='47948'>At the same time, I was very much surprised when I heard you two gentlemen come back this morning and learned that you had been chasing Selden. </span>
<span sid='47949' title='47949'>The poor fellow has enough to fight against without my putting more upon his track.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47950' title='47950'>'If you had told us of your own free will it would have been a different thing,' said the baronet. </span>
<span sid='47951' title='47951'>'You only told us, or rather your wife only told us, when it was forced from you and you could not help yourself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47952' title='47952'>'I didn't think you would have taken advantage of it, Sir Henry - indeed I didn't.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47953' title='47953'>'The man is a public danger. </span>
<span sid='47954' title='47954'>There are lonely houses scattered over the moor, and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing. </span>
<span sid='47955' title='47955'>You only want to get a glimpse of his face to see that. </span>
<span sid='47956' title='47956'>Look at Mr Stapleton's house, for example, with no one but himself to defend it. </span>
<span sid='47957' title='47957'>There's no safety for anyone until he is under lock and key.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47958' title='47958'>'He'll break into no house, sir. </span>
<span sid='47959' title='47959'>I give you my solemn word upon that. </span>
<span sid='47960' title='47960'>And he will never trouble anyone in this country again. </span>
<span sid='47961' title='47961'>I assure you, Sir Henry, that in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have been made and he will be on his way to South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>. </span>
<span sid='47962' title='47962'>For God's sake, sir, I beg of you not to let the police know that he is still on the moor. </span>
<span sid='47963' title='47963'>They have given up the chase there, and he can lie quiet until the ship is ready for him. </span>
<span sid='47964' title='47964'>You can't tell on him without getting my wife and me into trouble. </span>
<span sid='47965' title='47965'>I beg you, sir, to say nothing to the police.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47966' title='47966'>'What do you say, Watson?' </span>
<span sid='47967' title='47967'>I shrugged my shoulders. </span>
<span sid='47968' title='47968'>'If he were safely out of the country it would relieve the taxpayer of a burden.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47969' title='47969'>'But how about the chance of his holding someone up before he goes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47970' title='47970'>'He would not do anything so mad, sir. </span>
<span sid='47971' title='47971'>We have provided him with all that he can want. </span>
<span sid='47972' title='47972'>To commit a crime would be to show where he was hiding.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47973' title='47973'>'That is true,' said Sir Henry. </span>
<span sid='47974' title='47974'>'Well, Barrymore-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47975' title='47975'>'God bless you, sir, and thank you from my heart! </span>
<span sid='47976' title='47976'>It would have killed my poor wife had he been taken again.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47977' title='47977'>'I guess we are aiding and abetting a felony, Watson? </span>
<span sid='47978' title='47978'>But, after what we have heard, I don't feel as if I could give the man up, so there is an end of it. </span>
<span sid='47979' title='47979'>All right, Barrymore, you can go.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47980' title='47980'>With a few broken words of gratitude the man turned, but he hesitated and then came back.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47981' title='47981'>'You've been so kind to us, sir, that I should like to do the best I can for you in return. </span>
<span sid='47982' title='47982'>I know something, Sir Henry, and perhaps I should have said it before, but it was long after the inquest that I found it out. </span>
<span sid='47983' title='47983'>I've never breathed a word about it yet to a mortal man. </span>
<span sid='47984' title='47984'>It's about poor Sir Charles's death.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47985' title='47985'>The baronet and I were both upon our feet.</span>
<p>
<span sid='47986' title='47986'>'Do you know how he died?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47987' title='47987'>'No, sir, I don't know that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47988' title='47988'>'What, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47989' title='47989'>'I know why he was at the gate at that hour. </span>
<span sid='47990' title='47990'>It was to meet a woman.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47991' title='47991'>'To meet a woman! </span>
<span sid='47992' title='47992'>He?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47993' title='47993'>'Yes, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47994' title='47994'>'And the woman's name?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47995' title='47995'>'I can't give you the name, sir, but I can give you the initials. </span>
<span sid='47996' title='47996'>Her initials were L.L.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47997' title='47997'>'How do you know this, Barrymore?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='47998' title='47998'>'Well, Sir Henry, your uncle had a letter that morning. </span>
<span sid='47999' title='47999'>He had usually a great many letters, for he was a public man and well known for his kind heart, so that everyone who was in trouble was glad to turn to him. </span>
<span sid='48000' title='48000'>But that morning, as it chanced, there was only this one letter, so I took the more notice of it. </span>
<span sid='48001' title='48001'>It was from Coombe Tracey, and it was addressed in a woman's hand.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48002' title='48002'>'Well?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48003' title='48003'>'Well, sir, I thought no more of the matter, and never would have done had it not been for my wife. </span>
<span sid='48004' title='48004'>Only a few weeks ago she was cleaning out Sir Charles's study - it had never been touched since his death - and she found the ashes of a burned letter in the back of the grate. </span>
<span sid='48005' title='48005'>The greater part of it was charred to pieces, but one little slip, the end of a page, hung together, and the writing could still be read, though it was grey on a black ground. </span>
<span sid='48006' title='48006'>It seemed to us to be a postscript at the end of the letter, and it said: </span>
<span sid='48007' title='48007'>"Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn this letter, and be at the gate by ten o'clock." </span>
<span sid='48008' title='48008'>Beneath it were signed the initials L.L.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48009' title='48009'>'Have you got that slip?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48010' title='48010'>'No, sir, it crumbled all to bits after we moved it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48011' title='48011'>'Had Sir Charles received any other letters in the same writing?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48012' title='48012'>'Well, sir, I took no particular notice of his letters. </span>
<span sid='48013' title='48013'>I should not have noticed this one only it happened to come alone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48014' title='48014'>'And you have no idea who L.L. is?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48015' title='48015'>'No, sir. </span>
<span sid='48016' title='48016'>No more than you have. </span>
<span sid='48017' title='48017'>But I expect if we could lay our hands upon that lady we should know more about Sir Charles's death.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48018' title='48018'>'I cannot understand, Barrymore, how you came to conceal this important information.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48019' title='48019'>'Well, sir, it was immediately after that our own trouble came to us. </span>
<span sid='48020' title='48020'>And then again, sir, we were both of us very fond of Sir Charles, as we well might be considering all that he has done for us. </span>
<span sid='48021' title='48021'>To rake this up couldn't help our poor master, and it's well to go carefully when there's a lady in the case. </span>
<span sid='48022' title='48022'>Even the best of us-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48023' title='48023'>'You thought it might injure his reputation?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48024' title='48024'>'Well, sir, I thought no good could come of it. </span>
<span sid='48025' title='48025'>But now you have been kind to us, and I feel as if it would be treating you unfairly not to tell you all that I know about the matter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48026' title='48026'>'Very good, Barrymore, you can go.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48027' title='48027'>When the butler had left us, Sir Henry turned to me. </span>
<span sid='48028' title='48028'>'Well, Watson, what do you think of this new light?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48029' title='48029'>'It seems to leave the darkness rather blacker than before.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48030' title='48030'>'So I think. </span>
<span sid='48031' title='48031'>But if we can only trace L.L. it should clear up the whole business. </span>
<span sid='48032' title='48032'>We have gained that much. </span>
<span sid='48033' title='48033'>We know that there is someone who has the facts if we can only find her. </span>
<span sid='48034' title='48034'>What do you think we should do?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48035' title='48035'>'Let Holmes know all about it at once. </span>
<span sid='48036' title='48036'>It will give him the clue for which he has been seeking. </span>
<span sid='48037' title='48037'>I am much mistaken if it does not bring him down.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48038' title='48038'>I went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morning's conversation for Holmes. </span>
<span sid='48039' title='48039'>It was evident to me that he had been very busy of late, for the notes which I had from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> were few and short, with no comments upon the information which I had supplied, and hardly any reference to my mission. </span>
<span sid='48040' title='48040'>No doubt his blackmailing case is absorbing all his faculties. </span>
<span sid='48041' title='48041'>And yet this new factor must surely arrest his attention and renew his interest. </span>
<span sid='48042' title='48042'>I wish that he were here.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48043' title='48043'>October 17th - All day to-day the rain poured down, rustling on the ivy and dripping from the eaves. </span>
<span sid='48044' title='48044'>I thought of the convict out upon the bleak, cold, shelterless moor. </span>
<span sid='48045' title='48045'>Poor fellow! </span>
<span sid='48046' title='48046'>Whatever his crimes, he has suffered something to atone for them. </span>
<span sid='48047' title='48047'>And then I thought of that other one - the face in the cab, the figure against the moon. </span>
<span sid='48048' title='48048'>Was he also out in that deluge - the unseen watcher, the man of darkness? </span>
<span sid='48049' title='48049'>In the evening I put on my waterproof and I walked far upon the sodden moor, full of dark imaginings, the rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling about my ears. </span>
<span sid='48050' title='48050'>God help those who wander into the Great Mire now, for even the firm uplands are becoming a morass. </span>
<span sid='48051' title='48051'>I found the Black Tor upon which I had seen the solitary watcher, and from its craggy summit I looked out myself across the melancholy downs. </span>
<span sid='48052' title='48052'>Rain squalls drifted across their russet face, and the heavy, slate-coloured clouds hung low over the landscape, trailing in grey wreaths down the sides of the fantastic hills. </span>
<span sid='48053' title='48053'>In the distant hollow on the left, half hidden by the mist, the two thin towers of Baskerville Hall rose above the trees. </span>
<span sid='48054' title='48054'>They were the only signs of human life which I could see, save only those prehistoric huts which lay thickly upon the slopes of the hills. </span>
<span sid='48055' title='48055'>Nowhere was there any trace of that lonely man whom I had seen on the same spot two nights before.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48056' title='48056'>As I walked back I was overtaken by Dr Mortimer driving in his dog-cart over a rough moorland track, which led from the outlying farmhouse of Foulmire. </span>
<span sid='48057' title='48057'>He has been very attentive to us, and hardly a day has passed that he has not called at the Hall to see how we were getting on. </span>
<span sid='48058' title='48058'>He insisted upon my climbing into his dog-cart and he gave me a lift homewards. </span>
<span sid='48059' title='48059'>I found him much troubled over the disappearance of his little spaniel. </span>
<span sid='48060' title='48060'>It had wandered on to the moor and had never come back. </span>
<span sid='48061' title='48061'>I gave him such consolation as I might, but I thought of the pony on the Grimpen Mire, and I do not fancy that he will see his little dog again.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48062' title='48062'>'By the way, Mortimer,' said I, as we jolted along the rough road, 'I suppose there are few people living within driving distance of this whom you do not know?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48063' title='48063'>'Hardly any, I think.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48064' title='48064'>'Can you, then, tell me the name of any woman whose initials are L.L.?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48065' title='48065'>He thought for a few minutes. </span>
<span sid='48066' title='48066'>'No,' said he. </span>
<span sid='48067' title='48067'>'There are a few gipsies and labouring folk for whom I can't answer, but among the farmers or gentry there is no one whose initials are those. </span>
<span sid='48068' title='48068'>Wait a bit, though,' he added, after a pause. </span>
<span sid='48069' title='48069'>'There is Laura <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lyons&t=h'>Lyons</a> - her initials are L.L. - but she lives in Coombe Tracey.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48070' title='48070'>'Who is she?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48071' title='48071'>'She is Frankland's daughter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48072' title='48072'>'What? </span>
<span sid='48073' title='48073'>Old Frankland the crank?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48074' title='48074'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='48075' title='48075'>She married an artist named <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lyons&t=h'>Lyons</a>, who came sketching on the moor. </span>
<span sid='48076' title='48076'>He proved to be a blackguard and deserted her. </span>
<span sid='48077' title='48077'>The fault, from what I hear, may not have been entirely on one side. </span>
<span sid='48078' title='48078'>Her father refused to have anything to do with her, because she had married without his consent, and perhaps for one or two other reasons as well. </span>
<span sid='48079' title='48079'>So, between the old sinner and the young one the girl has had a pretty bad time.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48080' title='48080'>'How does she live?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48081' title='48081'>'I fancy old Frankland allows her a pittance, but it cannot be more, for his own affairs are considerably involved. </span>
<span sid='48082' title='48082'>Whatever she may have deserved one could not allow her to go hopelessly to the bad. </span>
<span sid='48083' title='48083'>Her story got about, and several of the people here did something to enable her to earn an honest living. </span>
<span sid='48084' title='48084'>Stapleton did for one, and Sir Charles for another. </span>
<span sid='48085' title='48085'>I gave a trifle myself. </span>
<span sid='48086' title='48086'>It was to set her up in a typewriting business.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48087' title='48087'>He wanted to know the object of my inquiries, but I managed to satisfy his curiosity without telling him too much, for there is no reason why we should take anyone into our confidence. </span>
<span sid='48088' title='48088'>Tomorrow morning I shall find my way to Coombe Tracey, and if I can see this Mrs Laura <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lyons&t=h'>Lyons</a>, of equivocal reputation, a long step will have been made towards clearing one incident in this chain of mysteries. </span>
<span sid='48089' title='48089'>I am certainly developing the wisdom of the serpent, for when Mortimer pressed his questions to an inconvenient extent I asked him casually to what type Frankland's skull belonged, and so heard nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive. </span>
<span sid='48090' title='48090'>I have not lived for years with Sherlock Holmes for nothing.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48091' title='48091'>I have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous and melancholy day. </span>
<span sid='48092' title='48092'>This was my conversation with Barrymore just now, which gives me one more strong card which I can play in due time.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48093' title='48093'>Mortimer had stayed to dinner, and he and the Baronet played Ã©cartÃ© afterwards. </span>
<span sid='48094' title='48094'>The butler brought me my coffee into the library, and I took the chance to ask him a few questions.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48095' title='48095'>'Well,' said I, 'has this precious relation of yours departed, or is he still lurking out yonder?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48096' title='48096'>'I don't know, sir. </span>
<span sid='48097' title='48097'>I hope to Heaven that he has gone, for he has brought nothing but trouble here! </span>
<span sid='48098' title='48098'>I've not heard of him since I left out food for him last, and that was three days ago.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48099' title='48099'>'Did you see him then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48100' title='48100'>'No, sir, but the food was gone when next I went that way.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48101' title='48101'>'Then he was certainly there?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48102' title='48102'>'So you would think, sir, unless it was the other man who took it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48103' title='48103'>I sat with my coffee-cup half-way to my lips, and stared at Barrymore.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48104' title='48104'>'You know that there is another man, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48105' title='48105'>'Yes, sir, there is another man upon the moor.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48106' title='48106'>'Have you seen him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48107' title='48107'>'No, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48108' title='48108'>'How do you know of him, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48109' title='48109'>'Selden told me of him, sir, a week ago or more. </span>
<span sid='48110' title='48110'>He's in 'hiding, too, but he's not a convict, so far as I can make out. </span>
<span sid='48111' title='48111'>I don't like it, Dr Watson - I tell you straight, sir, that I don't like it.' </span>
<span sid='48112' title='48112'>He spoke with a sudden passion of earnestness.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48113' title='48113'>'Now, listen to me, Barrymore! </span>
<span sid='48114' title='48114'>I have no interest in this matter but that of your master. </span>
<span sid='48115' title='48115'>I have come here with no object except to help him. </span>
<span sid='48116' title='48116'>Tell me, frankly, what it is that you don't like.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48117' title='48117'>Barrymore hesitated for a moment, as if he regretted his outburst, or found it difficult to express his own feelings in words.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48118' title='48118'>'It's all these goings-on, sir,' he cried, at last, waving his hand towards the rain-lashed window which faced the moor. </span>
<span sid='48119' title='48119'>'There's foul play somewhere, and there's black villainy brewing, to that I'll swear! </span>
<span sid='48120' title='48120'>Very glad I should be, sir, to see Sir Henry on his way back to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> again!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48121' title='48121'>'But what is it that alarms you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48122' title='48122'>'Look at Sir Charles's death! </span>
<span sid='48123' title='48123'>That was bad enough, for all that the coroner said. </span>
<span sid='48124' title='48124'>Look at the noises on the moor at night. </span>
<span sid='48125' title='48125'>There's not a man would cross it after sundown if he was paid for it. </span>
<span sid='48126' title='48126'>Look at this stranger hiding out yonder, and watching and waiting! </span>
<span sid='48127' title='48127'>What's he waiting for? </span>
<span sid='48128' title='48128'>What does it mean? </span>
<span sid='48129' title='48129'>It means no good to anyone of the name of Baskerville, and very glad I shall be to be quit of it all on the day that Sir Henry's new servants are ready to take over the Hall.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48130' title='48130'>'But about this stranger,' said I. </span>
<span sid='48131' title='48131'>'Can you tell me anything about him? </span>
<span sid='48132' title='48132'>What did Selden say? </span>
<span sid='48133' title='48133'>Did he find out where he hid or what he was doing?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48134' title='48134'>'He saw him once or twice, but he is a deep one, and gives nothing away. </span>
<span sid='48135' title='48135'>At first he thought that he was the police, but soon he found that he had some lay of his own. </span>
<span sid='48136' title='48136'>A kind of gentleman he was, as far as he could see, but what he was doing he could not make out.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48137' title='48137'>'And where did he say that he lived?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48138' title='48138'>'Among the old houses on the hillside - the stone huts where the old folk used to live.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48139' title='48139'>'But how about his food?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48140' title='48140'>'Selden found out that he has got a lad who works for him and brings him all he needs. </span>
<span sid='48141' title='48141'>I dare say he goes to Coombe Tracey for what he wants.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48142' title='48142'>'Very good, Barrymore. </span>
<span sid='48143' title='48143'>We may talk further of this some other time.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48144' title='48144'>When the butler had gone I walked over to the black window, and I looked through a blurred pane at the driving clouds and at the tossing outline of the wind-swept trees. </span>
<span sid='48145' title='48145'>It is a wild night indoors, and what must it be in a stone hut upon the moor? </span>
<span sid='48146' title='48146'>What passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to lurk in such a place at such a time? </span>
<span sid='48147' title='48147'>And what deep and earnest purpose can he have which calls for such a trial? </span>
<span sid='48148' title='48148'>There, in that hut upon the moor, seems to lie the very centre of that problem which has vexed me so sorely. </span>
<span sid='48149' title='48149'>I swear that another day shall not have passed before I have done all that man can do to reach the heart of the mystery.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48150' title='48150'>CHAPTER 11 : The Man on the Tor</span>
<p>
<span sid='48151' title='48151'>The extract from my private diary which forms the last chapter has brought my narrative up to the 18th of October, a time when these strange events began to move swiftly towards their terrible conclusion. </span>
<span sid='48152' title='48152'>The incidents of the next few days are indelibly graven upon my recollection, and I can tell them without reference to the notes made at the time. </span>
<span sid='48153' title='48153'>I start, then, from the day which succeeded that upon which I had established two facts of great importance, the one that Mrs Laura <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lyons&t=h'>Lyons</a> of Coombe Tracey had written to Sir Charles Baskerville and made an appointment with him at the very place and hour that he met his death, the other that the lurking man upon the moor was to be found among the stone huts upon the hillside. </span>
<span sid='48154' title='48154'>With these two facts in my possession I felt that either my intelligence or my courage must be deficient if I could not throw some further light upon these dark places.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48155' title='48155'>I had no opportunity to tell the baronet what I had learned about Mrs <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lyons&t=h'>Lyons</a> upon the evening before, for Dr Mortimer remained with him at cards until it was very late. </span>
<span sid='48156' title='48156'>At breakfast, however, I informed him about my discovery, and asked him whether he would care to accompany me to Coombe Tracey. </span>
<span sid='48157' title='48157'>At first he was very eager to come, but on second thoughts it seemed to both of us that if I went alone the results might be better. </span>
<span sid='48158' title='48158'>The more formal we made the visit the less information we might obtain. </span>
<span sid='48159' title='48159'>I left Sir Henry behind, therefore, not without some prickings of conscience, and drove off upon my new quest.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48160' title='48160'>When I reached Coombe Tracey I told Perkins to put up the horses, and I made inquiries for the lady whom I had come to interrogate. </span>
<span sid='48161' title='48161'>I had no difficulty in finding her rooms, which were central and well appointed. </span>
<span sid='48162' title='48162'>A maid showed me in without ceremony, and as I entered the sitting-room a lady who was sitting before a Remington typewriter sprang up with a pleasant smile of welcome. </span>
<span sid='48163' title='48163'>Her face fell, however, when she saw that I was a stranger, and she sat down again and asked me the object of my visit.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48164' title='48164'>The first impression left by Mrs <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lyons&t=h'>Lyons</a> was one of extreme beauty. </span>
<span sid='48165' title='48165'>Her eyes and hair were of the same rich hazel colour, and her cheeks, though considerably freckled, were flushed with the exquisite bloom of the brunette, the dainty pink which lurks at the heart of the sulphur rose. </span>
<span sid='48166' title='48166'>Admiration was, I repeat, the first impression. </span>
<span sid='48167' title='48167'>But the second was criticism. </span>
<span sid='48168' title='48168'>There was something subtly wrong with the face, some coarseness of expression, some hardness, perhaps, of eye, some looseness of lip which marred its perfect beauty. </span>
<span sid='48169' title='48169'>But these, of course, are after-thoughts. </span>
<span sid='48170' title='48170'>At the moment I was simply conscious that I was in the presence of a very handsome woman, and that she was asking me the reasons for my visit. </span>
<span sid='48171' title='48171'>I had not quite understood until that instant how delicate my mission was.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48172' title='48172'>'I have the pleasure', said I, 'of knowing your father.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48173' title='48173'>It was a clumsy introduction, and the lady made me feel it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48174' title='48174'>'There is nothing in common between my father and me,' she said. </span>
<span sid='48175' title='48175'>'I owe him nothing, and his friends are not mine. </span>
<span sid='48176' title='48176'>If it were not for the late Sir Charles Baskerville and some other kind hearts I might have starved for all that my father cared.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48177' title='48177'>'It was about the late Sir Charles Baskerville that I have come here to see you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48178' title='48178'>The freckles started out on the lady's face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48179' title='48179'>'What can I tell you about him?' she asked, and her fingers played nervously over the stops of her typewriter.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48180' title='48180'>'You knew him, did you not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48181' title='48181'>'I have already said that I owe a great deal to his kindness. </span>
<span sid='48182' title='48182'>If I am able to support myself it is largely due to the interest which he took in my unhappy situation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48183' title='48183'>'Did you correspond with him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48184' title='48184'>The lady looked quickly up, with an angry gleam in her hazel eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48185' title='48185'>'What is the object of these questions?' she asked, sharply.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48186' title='48186'>'The object is to avoid a public scandal. </span>
<span sid='48187' title='48187'>It is better that I should ask them here than that the matter should pass outside our control.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48188' title='48188'>She was silent and her face was very pale. </span>
<span sid='48189' title='48189'>At last she looked up with something reckless and defiant in her manner.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48190' title='48190'>'Well, I'll answer,' she said. </span>
<span sid='48191' title='48191'>'What are your questions?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48192' title='48192'>'Did you correspond with Sir Charles?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48193' title='48193'>'I certainly wrote to him once or twice to acknowledge his delicacy and his generosity.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48194' title='48194'>'Have you the dates of those letters?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48195' title='48195'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48196' title='48196'>'Have you ever met him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48197' title='48197'>'Yes, once or twice, when he came into Coombe Tracey. </span>
<span sid='48198' title='48198'>He was a very retiring man, and he preferred to do good by stealth.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48199' title='48199'>'But if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom, how did he know enough about your affairs to be able to help you, as you say that he has done?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48200' title='48200'>She met my difficulty with the utmost readiness.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48201' title='48201'>'There were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and united to help me. </span>
<span sid='48202' title='48202'>One was Mr Stapleton, a neighbour and intimate friend of Sir Charles. </span>
<span sid='48203' title='48203'>He was exceedingly kind, and it was through him that Sir Charles learned about my affairs.' </span>
<span sid='48204' title='48204'>I knew already that Sir Charles Baskerville had made Stapleton his almoner upon several occasions, so the lady's statement bore the impress of truth upon it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48205' title='48205'>'Did you ever write to Sir Charles asking him to meet you?' I continued.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48206' title='48206'>Mrs <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lyons&t=h'>Lyons</a> flushed with anger again.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48207' title='48207'>'Really, sir, this is a very extraordinary question.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48208' title='48208'>'I am sorry, madam, but I must repeat it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48209' title='48209'>'Then I answer - certainly not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48210' title='48210'>'Not on the very day of Sir Charles's death?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48211' title='48211'>The flush had faded in an instant, and a deathly face was before me. </span>
<span sid='48212' title='48212'>Her dry lips could not speak the 'No' which I saw father than heard.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48213' title='48213'>'Surely your memory deceives you,' said I. </span>
<span sid='48214' title='48214'>'I could even quote a passage of your letter. </span>
<span sid='48215' title='48215'>It ran "Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn this letter, and be at the gate by ten o'clock."'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48216' title='48216'>I thought that she had fainted, but she recovered herself by a supreme effort.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48217' title='48217'>'Is there no such thing as a gentleman?' she gasped.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48218' title='48218'>'You do Sir Charles an injustice. </span>
<span sid='48219' title='48219'>He did burn the letter. </span>
<span sid='48220' title='48220'>But sometimes a letter may be legible even when burned. </span>
<span sid='48221' title='48221'>You acknowledge now that you wrote it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48222' title='48222'>'Yes, I did write it,' she cried, pouring out her soul in a torrent of words. </span>
<span sid='48223' title='48223'>'I did write it. </span>
<span sid='48224' title='48224'>Why should I deny it? </span>
<span sid='48225' title='48225'>I have no reason to be ashamed of it. </span>
<span sid='48226' title='48226'>I wished him to help me. </span>
<span sid='48227' title='48227'>I believed that if I had an interview I could gain his help, so I asked him to meet me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48228' title='48228'>'But why at such an hour?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48229' title='48229'>'Because I had only just learned that he was going to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> next day and might be away for months. </span>
<span sid='48230' title='48230'>There were reasons why I could not get there earlier.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48231' title='48231'>'But why a rendezvous in the garden instead of a visit to the house?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48232' title='48232'>'Do you think a woman could go alone at that hour to a bachelor's house?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48233' title='48233'>'Well, what happened when you did get there?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48234' title='48234'>'I never went.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48235' title='48235'>'Mrs <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lyons&t=h'>Lyons</a>!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48236' title='48236'>'No, I swear it to you on all I hold sacred. </span>
<span sid='48237' title='48237'>I never went.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48238' title='48238'>Something intervened to prevent my going.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48239' title='48239'>'What was that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48240' title='48240'>'That is a private matter. </span>
<span sid='48241' title='48241'>I cannot tell it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48242' title='48242'>'You acknowledge then, that you made an appointment with Sir Charles at the very hour and place at which he met his death, but you deny that you kept the appointment?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48243' title='48243'>'That is the truth.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48244' title='48244'>Again and again I cross-questioned her, but I could never get past that point.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48245' title='48245'>'Mrs <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lyons&t=h'>Lyons</a>,' said I, as I rose from this long and inconclusive interview, 'you are taking a very great responsibility and putting yourself in a very false position by not making an absolutely clean breast of all that you know. </span>
<span sid='48246' title='48246'>If I have to call in the aid of the police you will find how seriously you are compromised. </span>
<span sid='48247' title='48247'>If your position is innocent, why did you in the first instance deny having written to Sir Charles upon that date?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48248' title='48248'>'Because I feared that some false conclusion might be drawn from it, and that I might find myself involved in a scandal.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48249' title='48249'>'And why were you so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy your letter?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48250' title='48250'>'If you have read the letter you will know.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48251' title='48251'>'I did not say that I had read all the letter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48252' title='48252'>'You quoted some of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48253' title='48253'>'I quoted the postscript. </span>
<span sid='48254' title='48254'>The letter had, as I said, been burned, and it was not all legible. </span>
<span sid='48255' title='48255'>I ask you once again why it was that you were so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy this letter which he received on the day of his death.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48256' title='48256'>'The matter is a very private one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48257' title='48257'>'The more reason why you should avoid a public investigation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48258' title='48258'>'I will tell you, then. </span>
<span sid='48259' title='48259'>If you have heard anything of my unhappy history you will know that I made a rash marriage and had reason to regret it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48260' title='48260'>'I have heard so much.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48261' title='48261'>'My life has been one incessant persecution from a husband whom I abhor. </span>
<span sid='48262' title='48262'>The law is upon his side, and every day I am faced by the possibility that he may force me to live with him. </span>
<span sid='48263' title='48263'>At the time that I wrote this letter to Sir Charles I had learned that there was a prospect of my regaining my freedom if certain expenses could be met It meant everything to me - peace of mind, happiness, self-respect-everything. </span>
<span sid='48264' title='48264'>I knew Sir Charles's generosity, and I thought that if he heard the story from my own lips he would help me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48265' title='48265'>'Then how is it that you did not go?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48266' title='48266'>'Because I received help in the interval from another source.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48267' title='48267'>'Why, then, did you not write to Sir Charles and explain this?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48268' title='48268'>'So I should have done had I not seen his death in the paper next morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48269' title='48269'>The woman's story hung coherently together, and all my questions were unable to shake it. </span>
<span sid='48270' title='48270'>I could only check it by finding if she had, indeed, instituted divorce proceedings against her husband at or about the time of the tragedy.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48271' title='48271'>It was unlikely that she would dare to say that she had not been to Baskerville Hall if she really had been, for a trap would be necessary to take her there, and could not have returned to Coombe Tracey until the early hours of the morning. </span>
<span sid='48272' title='48272'>Such an excursion could not be kept secret. </span>
<span sid='48273' title='48273'>The probability was, therefore, that she was telling the truth, or, at least, a part of the truth. </span>
<span sid='48274' title='48274'>I came away baffled and disheartened. </span>
<span sid='48275' title='48275'>Once again I had reached that dead wall which seemed to be built across every path by which I tried to get at the object of my mission. </span>
<span sid='48276' title='48276'>And yet the more I thought of the lady's face and of her manner the more I felt that something was being held back from me. </span>
<span sid='48277' title='48277'>Why should she turn so pale? </span>
<span sid='48278' title='48278'>Why should she fight against every admission until it was forced from her? </span>
<span sid='48279' title='48279'>Why should she have been so reticent at the time of the tragedy? </span>
<span sid='48280' title='48280'>Surely the explanation of all this could not be as innocent as she would have me believe. </span>
<span sid='48281' title='48281'>For the moment I could proceed no farther in that direction, but must turn back to that other clue which was to be sought for among the stone huts upon the moor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48282' title='48282'>And that was a most vague direction. </span>
<span sid='48283' title='48283'>I realized it as I drove back and noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient people. </span>
<span sid='48284' title='48284'>Barrymore's only indication had been that the stranger lived in one of these abandoned huts, and many hundreds of them are scattered throughout the length and breadth of the moor. </span>
<span sid='48285' title='48285'>But I had my own experience for a guide, since it had shown me the man himself standing upon the summit of the Black Tor. </span>
<span sid='48286' title='48286'>That, then, should be the centre of my search. </span>
<span sid='48287' title='48287'>From there I should explore every hut upon the moor until I lighted upon the right one. </span>
<span sid='48288' title='48288'>If this man were inside it I should find out from his own lips, at the point of my revolver if necessary, who he was and why he had dogged us so long. </span>
<span sid='48289' title='48289'>He might slip away from us in the crowd of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Regent Street&t=h'>Regent Street</a>, but it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely moor. </span>
<span sid='48290' title='48290'>On the other hand, if I should find the hut, and its tenant should not be within it, I must remain there, however long the vigil, until he returned. </span>
<span sid='48291' title='48291'>Holmes had missed him in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='48292' title='48292'>It would indeed be a triumph for me if I could run him to earth where my master had failed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48293' title='48293'>Luck had been against us again and again in this inquiry, but now at last it came to my aid. </span>
<span sid='48294' title='48294'>And the messenger of good fortune was none other than Mr Frankland, who was standing, grey-whiskered and red-faced, outside the gate of his garden, which opened on to the high road along which I travelled.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48295' title='48295'>'Good-day, Dr Watson,' cried he, with unwonted good humour, 'you must really give your horses a rest, and come in to have a glass of wine and to congratulate me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48296' title='48296'>My feelings towards him were far from being friendly after what I had heard of his treatment of his daughter, but I was anxious to send Perkins and the wagonette home, and the opportunity was a good one. </span>
<span sid='48297' title='48297'>I alighted and sent a message to Sir Henry that I should walk over in time for dinner. </span>
<span sid='48298' title='48298'>Then I followed Frankland into his dining-room. </span>
<span sid='48299' title='48299'>'It is a great day for me, sir - one of the red-letter days of my life,' he cried, with many chuckles. </span>
<span sid='48300' title='48300'>'I have brought off a double event. </span>
<span sid='48301' title='48301'>I mean to teach them in these parts that law is law, and that there is a man here who does not fear to invoke it. </span>
<span sid='48302' title='48302'>I have established a right of way through the centre of old Middleton's park, slap across it, sir, within a hundred yards of his own front door. </span>
<span sid='48303' title='48303'>What do you think of that? </span>
<span sid='48304' title='48304'>We'll teach these magnates that they cannot ride rough-shod over the rights of the commoners, confound them! </span>
<span sid='48305' title='48305'>And I've closed the wood where the Fernworthy folk used to picnic. </span>
<span sid='48306' title='48306'>These infernal people seem to think that there are no rights of property, and that they can swarm where they like with their papers and their bottles. </span>
<span sid='48307' title='48307'>Both cases decided, Dr Watson, and both in my favour. </span>
<span sid='48308' title='48308'>I haven't had such a day since I had Sir John Morland for trespass, because he shot in his own warren.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48309' title='48309'>'How on earth did you do that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48310' title='48310'>'Look it up in the books, sir. </span>
<span sid='48311' title='48311'>It will repay reading -  Frankland v. Morland, Court of Queen's Bench. </span>
<span sid='48312' title='48312'>It cost me Â£200, but I got my verdict.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48313' title='48313'>'Did it do you any good?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48314' title='48314'>'None, sir, none. </span>
<span sid='48315' title='48315'>I am proud to say that I had no interest in the matter. </span>
<span sid='48316' title='48316'>I act entirely from a sense of public duty. </span>
<span sid='48317' title='48317'>I have no doubt, for example, that the Fernworthy people will burn me in effigy to-night. </span>
<span sid='48318' title='48318'>I told the police last time they did it that they should stop these disgraceful exhibitions. </span>
<span sid='48319' title='48319'>The county constabulary is in a scandalous state, sir, and it has not afforded me the protection to which I am entitled. </span>
<span sid='48320' title='48320'>The case of Frankland v. Regina will bring the matter before the attention of the public. </span>
<span sid='48321' title='48321'>I told them that they would have occasion to regret their treatment of me, and already my words have come true.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48322' title='48322'>'How so?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48323' title='48323'>The old man put on a very knowing expression.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48324' title='48324'>'Because I could tell them what they are dying to know, but nothing would induce me to help the rascals in any way.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48325' title='48325'>I had been casting round for some excuse by which I could get away from his gossip, but now I began to wish to hear more of it. </span>
<span sid='48326' title='48326'>I had seen enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to understand that any strong sign of interest would be the surest way to stop his confidences.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48327' title='48327'>'Some poaching case, no doubt?' said I, with an indifferent manner.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48328' title='48328'>'Ha, ha, my boy, a very much more important matter than that! </span>
<span sid='48329' title='48329'>What about the convict on the moor?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48330' title='48330'>I stared. </span>
<span sid='48331' title='48331'>'You don't mean that you know where he is?' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48332' title='48332'>'I may not know exactly where he is, but I am quite sure that I could help the police to lay their hands on him. </span>
<span sid='48333' title='48333'>Has it never struck you that the way to catch that man was to find out where he got his food, and so trace it to him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48334' title='48334'>He certainly seemed to be getting uncomfortably near the truth. </span>
<span sid='48335' title='48335'>'No doubt,' said I, 'but how do you know that he is anywhere upon the moor?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48336' title='48336'>'I know it because I have seen with my own eyes the messenger who takes him his food.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48337' title='48337'>My heart sank for Barrymore. </span>
<span sid='48338' title='48338'>It was a serious thing to be in the power of this spiteful old busybody. </span>
<span sid='48339' title='48339'>But his next remark took a weight from my mind.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48340' title='48340'>'You'll be surprised to hear that his food is taken to him by a child. </span>
<span sid='48341' title='48341'>I see him every day through my telescope upon the roof. </span>
<span sid='48342' title='48342'>He passes along the same path at the same hour, and to whom should he be going except to the convict?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48343' title='48343'>Here was luck indeed! </span>
<span sid='48344' title='48344'>And yet I suppressed all appearance of interest. </span>
<span sid='48345' title='48345'>A child! </span>
<span sid='48346' title='48346'>Barrymore had said that our unknown was supplied by a boy. </span>
<span sid='48347' title='48347'>It was on his track, and not upon the convict's, that Frankland had stumbled. </span>
<span sid='48348' title='48348'>If I could get his knowledge it might save me a long and weary hunt. </span>
<span sid='48349' title='48349'>But incredulity and indifference were evidently my strongest cards.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48350' title='48350'>'I should say that it was much more likely that it was the son of one of the moorland shepherds taking out his father's dinner.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48351' title='48351'>The least appearance of opposition struck fire out of the old autocrat. </span>
<span sid='48352' title='48352'>His eyes looked malignantly at me, and his grey whiskers bristled like those of an angry cat.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48353' title='48353'>'Indeed, sir!' said he, pointing out over the wide-stretching moor. </span>
<span sid='48354' title='48354'>'Do you see that Black Tor over yonder? </span>
<span sid='48355' title='48355'>Well, do you see the low hill beyond with the thorn-bush upon it? </span>
<span sid='48356' title='48356'>It is the stoniest part of the whole moor. </span>
<span sid='48357' title='48357'>Is that a place where a shepherd would be likely to take his station? </span>
<span sid='48358' title='48358'>Your suggestion, sir, is a most absurd one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48359' title='48359'>I meekly answered that I had spoken without knowing all the facts. </span>
<span sid='48360' title='48360'>My submission pleased him and led him to further confidences.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48361' title='48361'>'You may be sure, sir, that I have very good grounds before I come to an opinion. </span>
<span sid='48362' title='48362'>I have seen the boy again and again with his bundle. </span>
<span sid='48363' title='48363'>Every day, and sometimes twice a day, I have been able - but wait a moment, Dr Watson. </span>
<span sid='48364' title='48364'>Do my eyes deceive me, or is there at the present moment something moving upon that hillside?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48365' title='48365'>It was several miles off, but I could distinctly see a small dark dot against the dull green and grey.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48366' title='48366'>'Come, sir, come!' cried Frankland, rushing upstairs. </span>
<span sid='48367' title='48367'>'You will see with your own eyes and judge for yourself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48368' title='48368'>The telescope, a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod, stood upon the flat leads of the house. </span>
<span sid='48369' title='48369'>Frankland clapped his eye to it and gave a cry of satisfaction.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48370' title='48370'>'Quick, Dr Watson, quick, before he passes over the hill!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48371' title='48371'>There he was, sure enough, a small urchin with a little bundle upon his shoulder, toiling slowly up the hill. </span>
<span sid='48372' title='48372'>When he reached the crest I saw the ragged, uncouth figure outlined for an instant against the cold blue sky. </span>
<span sid='48373' title='48373'>He looked round him, with a furtive and stealthy air, as one who dreads pursuit. </span>
<span sid='48374' title='48374'>Then he vanished over the hill.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48375' title='48375'>'Well! </span>
<span sid='48376' title='48376'>Am I right?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48377' title='48377'>'Certainly, there is a boy who seems to have some secret errand.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48378' title='48378'>'And what the errand is even a county constable could guess. </span>
<span sid='48379' title='48379'>But not one word shall they have from me, and I bind you to secrecy also, Dr Watson. </span>
<span sid='48380' title='48380'>Not a word! </span>
<span sid='48381' title='48381'>You understand?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48382' title='48382'>'Just as you wish.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48383' title='48383'>'They have treated me shamefully - shamefully. </span>
<span sid='48384' title='48384'>When the facts come out in Frankland v. Regina I venture to think that a thrill of indignation will run through the country. </span>
<span sid='48385' title='48385'>Nothing would induce me to help the police in any way. </span>
<span sid='48386' title='48386'>For all they cared it might have been me, instead of my effigy, which these rascals burned at the stake. </span>
<span sid='48387' title='48387'>Surely you are not going! </span>
<span sid='48388' title='48388'>You will help me to empty the decanter in honour of this great occasion!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48389' title='48389'>But I resisted all his solicitations and succeeded in dissuading him from his announced intention of walking home with me. </span>
<span sid='48390' title='48390'>I kept the road as long as his eye was on me, and then I struck off across the moor and made for the stony hill over which the boy had disappeared. </span>
<span sid='48391' title='48391'>Everything was working in my favour, and I swore that it should not be through lack of energy or perseverance that I should miss the chance which Fortune had thrown in my way.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48392' title='48392'>The sun was already sinking when I reached the summit of the hill, and the long slopes beneath me were all golden-green on one side and grey shadow on the other. </span>
<span sid='48393' title='48393'>A haze lay low upon the farthest sky-line, out of which jutted the fantastic shapes of Belliver and Vixen Tor. </span>
<span sid='48394' title='48394'>Over the wide expanse there was no sound and no movement. </span>
<span sid='48395' title='48395'>One great grey bird, a gull or curlew, soared aloft in the blue heaven. </span>
<span sid='48396' title='48396'>He and I seemed to be the only living things between the huge arch of the sky and the desert beneath it. </span>
<span sid='48397' title='48397'>The barren scene, the sense of loneliness, and the mystery and urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart. </span>
<span sid='48398' title='48398'>The boy was nowhere to be seen. </span>
<span sid='48399' title='48399'>But down beneath me in a cleft of the hills there was a circle of the old stone huts, and in the middle of them there was one which retained sufficient roof to act as a screen against the weather. </span>
<span sid='48400' title='48400'>My heart leaped within me as I saw it. </span>
<span sid='48401' title='48401'>This must be the burrow where the stranger lurked. </span>
<span sid='48402' title='48402'>At last my foot was on the threshold of his hiding-place - his secret was within my grasp.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48403' title='48403'>As I approached the hut, walking as warily as Stapleton would do when with poised net he drew near the settled butterfly, I satisfied myself that the place had indeed been used as a habitation. </span>
<span sid='48404' title='48404'>A vague pathway among the boulders led to the dilapidated opening which served as a door. </span>
<span sid='48405' title='48405'>All was silent within. </span>
<span sid='48406' title='48406'>The unknown might be lurking there, or he might be prowling on the moor. </span>
<span sid='48407' title='48407'>My nerves tingled with the sense of adventure. </span>
<span sid='48408' title='48408'>Throwing aside my cigarette, I closed my hand upon the butt of my revolver, and, walking swiftly up to the door, I looked in. </span>
<span sid='48409' title='48409'>The place was empty.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48410' title='48410'>But there were ample signs that I had not come upon a false scent. </span>
<span sid='48411' title='48411'>This was certainly where the man lived. </span>
<span sid='48412' title='48412'>Some blankets rolled in a waterproof lay upon that very stone slab upon which neolithic man had once slumbered. </span>
<span sid='48413' title='48413'>The ashes of a fire were heaped in a rude grate. </span>
<span sid='48414' title='48414'>Beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket half-full of water. </span>
<span sid='48415' title='48415'>A litter of empty tins showed that the place had been occupied for some time, and I saw, as my eyes became accustomed to the chequered light, a pannikin and a half-full bottle of spirits standing in the corner. </span>
<span sid='48416' title='48416'>In the middle of the hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table, and upon this stood a small cloth bundle - the same, no doubt, which I had seen through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy. </span>
<span sid='48417' title='48417'>It contained a loaf of bread, a tinned tongue, and two tins of preserved peaches. </span>
<span sid='48418' title='48418'>As I set it down again, after having examined it, my heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper with writing upon it. </span>
<span sid='48419' title='48419'>I raised it, and this was what I read, roughly scrawled in pencil:</span>
<p>
<span sid='48420' title='48420'>'Dr Watson has gone to Coombe Tracey.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48421' title='48421'>For a minute I stood there with the paper in my hands thinking out the meaning of this curt message. </span>
<span sid='48422' title='48422'>It was I, then, and not Sir Henry, who was being dogged by this secret man. </span>
<span sid='48423' title='48423'>He had not followed me himself, but he had set an agent - the boy, perhaps - upon my track, and this was his report. </span>
<span sid='48424' title='48424'>Possibly I had taken no step since I had been upon the moor which had not been observed and repeated. </span>
<span sid='48425' title='48425'>Always there was this feeling of an unseen force, a fine net drawn round us with infinite skill and delicacy, holding us so lightly that it was only at some supreme moment that one realized that one was indeed entangled in its meshes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48426' title='48426'>If there was one report there might be others, so I looked round the hut in search of them. </span>
<span sid='48427' title='48427'>There was no trace, however, of anything of the kind, nor could I discover any sign which might indicate the character or intentions of the man who lived in this singular place, save that he must be of Spartan habits, and cared little for the comforts of life. </span>
<span sid='48428' title='48428'>When I thought of the heavy rains and looked at the gaping roof I understood how strong and immutable must be the purpose which had kept him in that inhospitable abode. </span>
<span sid='48429' title='48429'>Was he our malignant enemy, or was he by chance our guardian angel? </span>
<span sid='48430' title='48430'>I swore that I would not leave the hut until I knew.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48431' title='48431'>Outside the sun was sinking low and the west was blazing with scarlet and gold. </span>
<span sid='48432' title='48432'>Its reflection was shot back in ruddy patches by the distant pools which lay amid the Great Grimpen Mire. </span>
<span sid='48433' title='48433'>There were the two towers of Baskerville Hall, and there a distant blur of smoke which marked the village of Grimpen. </span>
<span sid='48434' title='48434'>Between the two, behind the hill, was the house of the Stapletons. </span>
<span sid='48435' title='48435'>All was sweet and mellow and peaceful in the golden evening light, and yet as I looked at them my soul shared none of the peace of Nature, but quivered at the vagueness and the terror of that interview which every instant was bringing nearer. </span>
<span sid='48436' title='48436'>With tingling nerves, but a fixed purpose, I sat in the dark recess of the hut and waited with sombre patience for the coming of its tenant.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48437' title='48437'>And then at last I heard him. </span>
<span sid='48438' title='48438'>Far away came the sharp clink of a boot striking upon a stone. </span>
<span sid='48439' title='48439'>Then another and yet another, coming nearer and nearer. </span>
<span sid='48440' title='48440'>I shrank back into the darkest corner, and cocked the pistol in my pocket, determined not to discover myself until I had an opportunity of seeing something of the stranger. </span>
<span sid='48441' title='48441'>There was a long pause, which showed that he had stopped. </span>
<span sid='48442' title='48442'>Then once more the footsteps approached and a shadow fell across the opening of the hut.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48443' title='48443'>'It is a lovely evening, my dear Watson,' said a well-known voice. </span>
<span sid='48444' title='48444'>'I really think that you will be more comfortable outside than in.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48445' title='48445'>CHAPTER 12 : Death on the Moor</span>
<p>
<span sid='48446' title='48446'>For a moment or two I sat breathless, hardly able to believe my ears. </span>
<span sid='48447' title='48447'>Then my senses and my voice came back to me, while a crushing weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be lifted from my soul. </span>
<span sid='48448' title='48448'>That cold, incisive, ironical voice could belong to but one man in all the world.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48449' title='48449'>'Holmes!' I cried - 'Holmes!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48450' title='48450'>'Come out,' said he, 'and please be careful with the revolver.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48451' title='48451'>I stooped under the rude lintel, and there he sat upon a stone outside, his grey eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon my astonished features. </span>
<span sid='48452' title='48452'>He was thin and worn, but clear and alert, his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened by the wind. </span>
<span sid='48453' title='48453'>In his tweed suit and cloth cap he looked like any other tourist upon the moor, and he had contrived, with that cat-like love of personal cleanliness which was one of his characteristics, that his chin should be as smooth and his linen as perfect as if he were in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48454' title='48454'>'I never was more glad to see anyone in my life,' said I, as I wrung him by the hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48455' title='48455'>'Or more astonished, eh?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48456' title='48456'>'Well, I must confess to it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48457' title='48457'>'The surprise was not all on one side, I assure you. </span>
<span sid='48458' title='48458'>I had no idea that you found my occasional retreat, still less that you were inside it, until I was within twenty paces of the door.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48459' title='48459'>'My footprint, I presume?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48460' title='48460'>'No, Watson, I fear that I could not undertake to recognize your footprint amid all the footprints of the world. </span>
<span sid='48461' title='48461'>If you seriously desire to deceive me you must change your tobacconist, for when I see the stub of a cigarette marked Bradley, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Oxford Street&t=h'>Oxford Street</a>, I know that my friend Watson is in the neighbourhood. </span>
<span sid='48462' title='48462'>You will see it there beside the path. </span>
<span sid='48463' title='48463'>You threw it down, no doubt, at that supreme moment when you charged into the empty hut.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48464' title='48464'>'Exactly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48465' title='48465'>'I thought as much - and knowing your admirable tenacity, I was convinced that you were sitting in ambush, a weapon within reach, waiting for the tenant to return. </span>
<span sid='48466' title='48466'>So you actually thought that I was the criminal?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48467' title='48467'>'I did not know who you were, but I was determined to find out.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48468' title='48468'>'Excellent, Watson! </span>
<span sid='48469' title='48469'>And how did you localize me? </span>
<span sid='48470' title='48470'>You saw me, perhaps, on the night of the convict hunt, when I was so imprudent as to allow the moon to rise behind me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48471' title='48471'>'Yes, I saw you then.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48472' title='48472'>'And have, no doubt, searched all the huts until you came to this one?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48473' title='48473'>'No, your boy had been observed, and that gave me a guide where to look.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48474' title='48474'>'The old gentleman with the telescope, no doubt. </span>
<span sid='48475' title='48475'>I could not make it out when first I saw the light flashing upon the lens.' </span>
<span sid='48476' title='48476'>He rose and peeped into the hut. </span>
<span sid='48477' title='48477'>'Ha, I see that Cartwright has brought up some supplies. </span>
<span sid='48478' title='48478'>What's this paper? </span>
<span sid='48479' title='48479'>So you have been to Coombe Tracey, have you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48480' title='48480'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48481' title='48481'>'To see Mrs Laura <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lyons&t=h'>Lyons</a>?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48482' title='48482'>'Exactly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48483' title='48483'>'Well done! </span>
<span sid='48484' title='48484'>Our researches have evidently been running on parallel lines, and when we unite our results I expect we shall have a fairly full knowledge of the case.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48485' title='48485'>'Well, I am glad from my heart that you are here, for indeed the responsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for my nerves. </span>
<span sid='48486' title='48486'>But how in the name of wonder did you come here, and what have you been doing? </span>
<span sid='48487' title='48487'>I thought that you were in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> working out that case of blackmailing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48488' title='48488'>'That was what I wished you to think.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48489' title='48489'>'Then you use me, and yet do not trust me!' I cried, with some bitterness. </span>
<span sid='48490' title='48490'>'I think that I have deserved better at your hands, Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48491' title='48491'>'My dear fellow, you have been invaluable to me in this as in many other cases, and I beg that you will forgive me if I have seemed to play a trick upon you. </span>
<span sid='48492' title='48492'>In truth, it was partly for your own sake that I did it, and it was my appreciation of the danger which you ran which led me to come down and examine the matter for myself. </span>
<span sid='48493' title='48493'>Had I been with Sir Henry and you it is evident that my point of view would have been the same as yours, and my presence would have warned our very formidable opponents to be on their guard. </span>
<span sid='48494' title='48494'>As it is, I have been able to get about as I could not possibly have done had I been living at the Hall, and I remain an unknown factor in the business, ready to throw in all my weight at a critical moment.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48495' title='48495'>'But why keep me in the dark?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48496' title='48496'>'For you to know could not have helped us, and might possibly have led to my discovery. </span>
<span sid='48497' title='48497'>You would have wished to tell me something, or in your kindness you would have brought me out some comfort or other, and so an unnecessary risk would be run. </span>
<span sid='48498' title='48498'>I brought Cartwright down with me - you remember the little chap at the Express office-and he has seen after my simple wants: a loaf of bread and a clean collar. </span>
<span sid='48499' title='48499'>What does man want more? </span>
<span sid='48500' title='48500'>He has given me an extra pair of eyes upon a very active pair of feet, and both have been invaluable.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48501' title='48501'>'Then my reports have all been wasted!' </span>
<span sid='48502' title='48502'>My voice trembled as I recalled the pains and the pride with which I had composed them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48503' title='48503'>Holmes took a bundle of papers from his pocket.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48504' title='48504'>'Here are your reports, my dear fellow, and very well thumbed, I assure you. </span>
<span sid='48505' title='48505'>I made excellent arrangements, and they are only delayed one day upon their way. </span>
<span sid='48506' title='48506'>I must compliment you exceedingly upon the zeal and the intelligence which you have shown over an extraordinarily difficult case.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48507' title='48507'>I was still rather raw over the deception which had been practised upon me, but the warmth of Holmes's praise drove my anger from my mind. </span>
<span sid='48508' title='48508'>I felt also in my heart that he was right in what he said, and that it was really best for our purpose that I should not have known that he was upon the moor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48509' title='48509'>'That's better,' said he, seeing the shadow rise from my face. </span>
<span sid='48510' title='48510'>'And now tell me the result of your visit to Mrs Laura <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lyons&t=h'>Lyons</a> - it was not difficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you had gone, for I am already aware that she is the one person in Coombe Tracey who might be of service to us in the matter. </span>
<span sid='48511' title='48511'>In fact, if you had not gone to-day it is exceedingly probable that I should have gone to-morrow.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48512' title='48512'>The sun had set and dusk was settling over the moor. </span>
<span sid='48513' title='48513'>The air had turned chill, and we withdrew into the hut for warmth. </span>
<span sid='48514' title='48514'>There, sitting together in the twilight, I told Holmes of my conversation with the lady. </span>
<span sid='48515' title='48515'>So interested was he that I had to repeat some of it twice before he was satisfied.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48516' title='48516'>'This is most important,' said he, when I had concluded. </span>
<span sid='48517' title='48517'>'It fills up a gap which I had been unable to bridge, in this most complex affair. </span>
<span sid='48518' title='48518'>You are aware, perhaps, that a close intimacy exists between this lady and the man Stapleton?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48519' title='48519'>'I did not know of a close intimacy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48520' title='48520'>'There can be no doubt about the matter. </span>
<span sid='48521' title='48521'>They meet, they write, there is a complete understanding between them. </span>
<span sid='48522' title='48522'>Now, this puts a very powerful weapon into our hands. </span>
<span sid='48523' title='48523'>If I could use it to detach his wife-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48524' title='48524'>'His wife?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48525' title='48525'>'I am giving you some information now, in return for all that you have given me. </span>
<span sid='48526' title='48526'>The lady who has passed here as Miss Stapleton is in reality his wife.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48527' title='48527'>'Good heavens, Holmes! </span>
<span sid='48528' title='48528'>Are you sure of what you say? </span>
<span sid='48529' title='48529'>How could he have permitted Sir Henry to fall in love with her?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48530' title='48530'>'Sir Henry's falling in love could do no harm to anyone except Sir Henry. </span>
<span sid='48531' title='48531'>He took particular care that Sir Henry did not make love to her, as you have yourself observed. </span>
<span sid='48532' title='48532'>I repeat that the lady is his wife and not his sister.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48533' title='48533'>'But why this elaborate deception?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48534' title='48534'>'Because he foresaw that she would be very much more useful to him in the character of a free woman.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48535' title='48535'>All my unspoken instincts, my vague suspicions, suddenly took shape and centred upon the naturalist. </span>
<span sid='48536' title='48536'>In that impassive, colourless man, with his straw hat and his butterfly-net, I seemed to see something terrible - a creature of infinite patience and craft, with a smiling face and a murderous heart.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48537' title='48537'>'It is he, then, who is our enemy - it is he who dogged us in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48538' title='48538'>'So I read the riddle.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48539' title='48539'>'And the warning - it must have come from her!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48540' title='48540'>'Exactly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48541' title='48541'>The shape of some monstrous villainy, half seen, half guessed, loomed through the darkness which had girt me so long.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48542' title='48542'>'But are you sure of this, Holmes? </span>
<span sid='48543' title='48543'>How do you know that the woman is his wife?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48544' title='48544'>'Because he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piece of autobiography upon the occasion when he first met you, and I dare say he has many a time regretted it since. </span>
<span sid='48545' title='48545'>He was once a schoolmaster in the North of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>. </span>
<span sid='48546' title='48546'>Now, there is no one more easy to trace than a schoolmaster. </span>
<span sid='48547' title='48547'>There are scholastic agencies by which one may identify any man who has been in the profession. </span>
<span sid='48548' title='48548'>A little investigation showed me that a school had come to grief under atrocious circumstances, and that the man who had owned it - the name was different - had disappeared with his wife. </span>
<span sid='48549' title='48549'>The description agreed. </span>
<span sid='48550' title='48550'>When I learned that the missing man was devoted to entomology the identification was complete.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48551' title='48551'>The darkness was rising, but much was still hidden by the shadows.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48552' title='48552'>'If this woman is in truth his wife, where does Mrs Laura <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lyons&t=h'>Lyons</a> come in?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48553' title='48553'>'That is one of the points upon which your own researches have shed a light. </span>
<span sid='48554' title='48554'>Your interview with the lady has cleared the situation very much. </span>
<span sid='48555' title='48555'>I did not know about a projected divorce between herself and her husband. </span>
<span sid='48556' title='48556'>In that case, regarding Stapleton as an unmarried man, she counted no doubt upon becoming his wife.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48557' title='48557'>'And when she is undeceived?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48558' title='48558'>'Why, then we may find the lady of service. </span>
<span sid='48559' title='48559'>It must be our first duty to see her - both of us - tomorrow. </span>
<span sid='48560' title='48560'>Don't you think, Watson, that you are away from your charge rather long? </span>
<span sid='48561' title='48561'>Your place should be at Baskerville Hall.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48562' title='48562'>The last red streaks had faded away in the west and night had settled upon the moor. </span>
<span sid='48563' title='48563'>A few faint stars were gleaming in a violet sky.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48564' title='48564'>'One last question, Holmes,' I said, as I rose. </span>
<span sid='48565' title='48565'>'Surely there is no need of secrecy between you and me. </span>
<span sid='48566' title='48566'>What is the meaning of it all? </span>
<span sid='48567' title='48567'>What is he after?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48568' title='48568'>Holmes's voice sank as he answered - 'It is murder, Watson - refined, cold-blooded, deliberate murder. </span>
<span sid='48569' title='48569'>Do not ask me for particulars. </span>
<span sid='48570' title='48570'>My nets are closing upon him, even as his are upon Sir Henry, and with your help he is already almost at my mercy. </span>
<span sid='48571' title='48571'>There is but one danger which can threaten us. </span>
<span sid='48572' title='48572'>It is that he should strike before we are ready to do so. </span>
<span sid='48573' title='48573'>Another day - two at the most - and I have my case complete, but until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother watched her ailing child. </span>
<span sid='48574' title='48574'>Your mission to-day has justified itself, and yet I could almost wish that you had not left his side - Hark!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48575' title='48575'>A terrible scream - a prolonged yell of horror and anguish burst out of the silence of the moor. </span>
<span sid='48576' title='48576'>That frightful cry turned the blood to ice in my veins.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48577' title='48577'>'Oh, my God!' I gasped. </span>
<span sid='48578' title='48578'>'What is it? </span>
<span sid='48579' title='48579'>What does it mean?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48580' title='48580'>Holmes had sprung to his feet, and I saw his dark, athletic outline at the door of the hut, his shoulders stooping, his head thrust forward, his face peering into the darkness.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48581' title='48581'>'Hush!' he whispered. </span>
<span sid='48582' title='48582'>'Hush!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48583' title='48583'>The cry had been loud on account of its vehemence, but it had pealed out from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain. </span>
<span sid='48584' title='48584'>Now it burst upon our ears, nearer, louder, more urgent than before.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48585' title='48585'>'Where is it?' </span>
<span sid='48586' title='48586'>Holmes whispered, and I knew from the thrill of his voice that he, the man of iron, was shaken to the soul. </span>
<span sid='48587' title='48587'>'Where is it, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48588' title='48588'>'There, I think.' </span>
<span sid='48589' title='48589'>I pointed into the darkness.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48590' title='48590'>'No, there!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48591' title='48591'>Again the agonized cry swept through the silent night, louder and much nearer than ever. </span>
<span sid='48592' title='48592'>And a new sound mingled with it, a deep, muttered rumble, musical and yet menacing, rising and falling like the low, constant murmur of the sea.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48593' title='48593'>'The hound!' cried Holmes. </span>
<span sid='48594' title='48594'>'Come, Watson, come! </span>
<span sid='48595' title='48595'>Great heavens, if we are too late!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48596' title='48596'>He had started running swiftly over the moor, and I had followed at his heels. </span>
<span sid='48597' title='48597'>But now from somewhere among the broken ground immediately in front of us there came one last despairing yell, and then a dull, heavy thud. </span>
<span sid='48598' title='48598'>We halted and listened. </span>
<span sid='48599' title='48599'>Not another sound broke the heavy silence of the windless night.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48600' title='48600'>I saw Holmes put his hand to his forehead, like a man distracted. </span>
<span sid='48601' title='48601'>He stamped his feet upon the ground.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48602' title='48602'>'He has beaten us, Watson. </span>
<span sid='48603' title='48603'>We are too late.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48604' title='48604'>'No, no, surely not!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48605' title='48605'>'Fool that I was to hold my hand. </span>
<span sid='48606' title='48606'>And you, Watson, see what comes of abandoning your charge! </span>
<span sid='48607' title='48607'>But, by Heaven, if the worst has happened, we'll avenge him!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48608' title='48608'>Blindly we ran through the gloom, blundering against boulders, forcing our way through gorse bushes, panting up hills and rushing down slopes, heading always in the direction whence those dreadful sounds had come. </span>
<span sid='48609' title='48609'>At every rise Holmes looked eagerly round him, but the shadows were thick upon the moor and nothing moved upon its dreary face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48610' title='48610'>'Can you see anything?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48611' title='48611'>'Nothing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48612' title='48612'>'But hark, what is that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48613' title='48613'>A low moan had fallen upon our ears. </span>
<span sid='48614' title='48614'>There it was again upon our left! </span>
<span sid='48615' title='48615'>On that side a ridge of rocks ended in a sheer cliff, which overlooked a stone-strewn slope. </span>
<span sid='48616' title='48616'>On its jagged face was spread-eagled some dark, irregular object. </span>
<span sid='48617' title='48617'>As we ran towards it the vague outline hardened into a definite shape. </span>
<span sid='48618' title='48618'>It was a prostrate man face downwards upon the ground, the head doubled under him at a horrible angle, the shoulders rounded and the body hunched together as if in the act of throwing a somersault. </span>
<span sid='48619' title='48619'>So grotesque was the attitude that I could not for the instant realize that that moan had been the passing of his soul. </span>
<span sid='48620' title='48620'>Not a whisper, not a rustle, rose now from the dark figure over which we stooped. </span>
<span sid='48621' title='48621'>Holmes laid his hand upon him, and held it up again, with an exclamation of horror. </span>
<span sid='48622' title='48622'>The gleam of the match which he struck shone upon his clotted fingers and upon the ghastly pool which widened slowly from the crushed skull of the victim. </span>
<span sid='48623' title='48623'>And it shone upon something else which turned our hearts sick and faint within us - the body of Sir Henry Baskerville!</span>
<p>
<span sid='48624' title='48624'>There was no chance of either of us forgetting that peculiar ruddy tweed suit - the very one which he had worn on the first morning that we had seen him in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='48625' title='48625'>We caught the one clear glimpse of it, and then the match flickered and went out, even as the hope had gone out of our souls. </span>
<span sid='48626' title='48626'>Holmes groaned, and his face glimmered white through the darkness.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48627' title='48627'>'The brute! the brute!' I cried, with clenched hands. </span>
<span sid='48628' title='48628'>'Oh, Holmes, I shall never forgive myself for having left him to his fate.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48629' title='48629'>'I am more to blame than you, Watson. </span>
<span sid='48630' title='48630'>In order to have my case well rounded and complete, I have thrown away the life of my client. </span>
<span sid='48631' title='48631'>It is the greatest blow which has befallen me in my career. </span>
<span sid='48632' title='48632'>But how could I know - how could I know - that he would risk his life alone upon the moor in the face of all my warnings?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48633' title='48633'>'That we should have heard his screams - my God, those screams! - and yet have been unable to save him! </span>
<span sid='48634' title='48634'>Where is this brute of a hound which drove him to his death? </span>
<span sid='48635' title='48635'>It may be lurking among these rocks at this instant. </span>
<span sid='48636' title='48636'>And Stapleton, where is he? </span>
<span sid='48637' title='48637'>He shall answer for this deed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48638' title='48638'>'He shall. </span>
<span sid='48639' title='48639'>I will see to that. </span>
<span sid='48640' title='48640'>Uncle and nephew have been murdered - the one frightened to death by the very sight of a beast which he thought to be supernatural, the other driven to his end in his wild flight to escape from it. </span>
<span sid='48641' title='48641'>But now we have to prove the connection between the man and the beast. </span>
<span sid='48642' title='48642'>Save from what we heard, we cannot even swear to the existence of the latter, since Sir Henry has evidently died from the fall. </span>
<span sid='48643' title='48643'>But, by heavens, cunning as he is, the fellow shall be in my power before another day is past!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48644' title='48644'>We stood with bitter hearts on either side of the mangled body, overwhelmed by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which had brought all our long and weary labours to so piteous an end. </span>
<span sid='48645' title='48645'>Then, as the moon rose, we climbed to the top of the rocks over which our poor friend had fallen, and from the summit we gazed out over the shadowy moor, half silver and half gloom. </span>
<span sid='48646' title='48646'>Far away, miles off, in the direction of Grimpen, a single steady yellow light was shining. </span>
<span sid='48647' title='48647'>It could only come from the lonely abode of the Stapletons. </span>
<span sid='48648' title='48648'>With a bitter curse I shook my fist at it as I gazed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48649' title='48649'>'Why should we not seize him at once?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48650' title='48650'>'Our case is not complete. </span>
<span sid='48651' title='48651'>The fellow is wary and cunning to the last degree. </span>
<span sid='48652' title='48652'>It is not what we know, but what we can prove. </span>
<span sid='48653' title='48653'>If we make one false move the villain may escape us yet.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48654' title='48654'>'What can we do?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48655' title='48655'>'There will be plenty for us to do to-morrow. </span>
<span sid='48656' title='48656'>To-night we can only perform the last offices to our poor friend.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48657' title='48657'>Together we made our way down the precipitous slope and approached the body, black and clear against the silver stones. </span>
<span sid='48658' title='48658'>The agony of those contorted limbs struck me with a spasm of pain and blurred my eyes with tears.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48659' title='48659'>'We must send for help, Holmes! </span>
<span sid='48660' title='48660'>We cannot carry him all the way to the Hall. </span>
<span sid='48661' title='48661'>Good heavens, are you mad?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48662' title='48662'>He had uttered a cry and bent over the body. </span>
<span sid='48663' title='48663'>Now he was dancing and laughing and wringing my hand. </span>
<span sid='48664' title='48664'>Could this be my stem, self-contained friend? </span>
<span sid='48665' title='48665'>These were hidden fires, indeed!</span>
<p>
<span sid='48666' title='48666'>'A beard! </span>
<span sid='48667' title='48667'>A beard! </span>
<span sid='48668' title='48668'>The man has a beard!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48669' title='48669'>'A beard?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48670' title='48670'>'It is not the Baronet - it is - why, it is my neighbour, the convict!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48671' title='48671'>With feverish haste we had turned the body over, and that dripping beard was pointing up to the cold, clear moon. </span>
<span sid='48672' title='48672'>There could be no doubt about the beetling forehead, the sunken animal eyes. </span>
<span sid='48673' title='48673'>It was indeed the same face which had glared upon me in the light of the candle from over the rock - the face of Selden, the criminal.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48674' title='48674'>Then in an instant it was all clear to me. </span>
<span sid='48675' title='48675'>I remembered how the Baronet had told me that he had handed his old wardrobe to Barrymore. </span>
<span sid='48676' title='48676'>Barrymore had passed it on in order to help Selden in his escape. </span>
<span sid='48677' title='48677'>Boots, shirt, cap - it was all Sir Henry's. </span>
<span sid='48678' title='48678'>The tragedy was still black enough, but this man had at least deserved death by the laws of his country. </span>
<span sid='48679' title='48679'>I told Holmes how the matter stood, my heart bubbling over with thankfulness and joy.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48680' title='48680'>'Then the clothes have been the poor fellow's death,' said he. </span>
<span sid='48681' title='48681'>'It is clear enough that the hound has been laid on from some article of Sir Henry's - the boot which was abstracted in the hotel, in all probability - and so ran this man down. </span>
<span sid='48682' title='48682'>There is one very singular thing, however: </span>
<span sid='48683' title='48683'>How came Selden, in the darkness, to know that the hound was on his trail?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48684' title='48684'>'He heard him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48685' title='48685'>'To hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like this convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk recapture by screaming wildly for help. </span>
<span sid='48686' title='48686'>By his cries he must have run a long way after he knew the animal was on his track. </span>
<span sid='48687' title='48687'>How did he know?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48688' title='48688'>'A greater mystery to me is why this hound, presuming that all our conjectures are correct-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48689' title='48689'>'I presume nothing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48690' title='48690'>'Well, then, why this hound should be loose to-night. </span>
<span sid='48691' title='48691'>I suppose that it does not always run loose upon the moor. </span>
<span sid='48692' title='48692'>Stapleton would not let it go unless he had reason to think that Sir Henry would be there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48693' title='48693'>'My difficulty is the more formidable of the two, for I think that we shall very shortly get an explanation of yours, while mine may remain for ever a mystery. </span>
<span sid='48694' title='48694'>The question now is, what shall we do with this poor wretch's body? </span>
<span sid='48695' title='48695'>We cannot leave it here to the foxes and the ravens.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48696' title='48696'>'I suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can communicate with the police.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48697' title='48697'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='48698' title='48698'>I have no doubt that you and I could carry it so far. </span>
<span sid='48699' title='48699'>Hullo, Watson, what's this? </span>
<span sid='48700' title='48700'>It's the man himself, by all that's wonderful and audacious! </span>
<span sid='48701' title='48701'>Not a word to show your suspicions - not a word, or my plans crumble to the ground.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48702' title='48702'>A figure was approaching us over the moor, and I saw the dull red glow of a cigar. </span>
<span sid='48703' title='48703'>The moon shone upon him, and I could distinguish the dapper shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist. </span>
<span sid='48704' title='48704'>He stopped when he saw us, and then came on again.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48705' title='48705'>'Why, Dr Watson, that's not you, is it? </span>
<span sid='48706' title='48706'>You are the last man that I should have expected to see out on the moor at this time of night. </span>
<span sid='48707' title='48707'>But, dear me, what's this? </span>
<span sid='48708' title='48708'>Somebody hurt? </span>
<span sid='48709' title='48709'>Not - don't tell me that is our friend Sir Henry!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48710' title='48710'>He hurried past me and stooped over the dead man. </span>
<span sid='48711' title='48711'>I heard a sharp intake of breath and the cigar fell from his fingers.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48712' title='48712'>'Who - who's this?' he stammered. </span>
<span sid='48713' title='48713'>'It is Selden, the man who escaped from Princetown.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48714' title='48714'>Stapleton turned a ghastly face upon us, but by a supreme effort he had overcome his amazement and his disappointment. </span>
<span sid='48715' title='48715'>He looked sharply from Holmes to me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48716' title='48716'>'Dear me! </span>
<span sid='48717' title='48717'>What a very shocking affair! </span>
<span sid='48718' title='48718'>How did he die?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48719' title='48719'>'He appears to have broken his neck by falling over these rocks. </span>
<span sid='48720' title='48720'>My friend and I were strolling on the moor when we heard a cry.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48721' title='48721'>'I heard a cry also. </span>
<span sid='48722' title='48722'>That was what brought me out. </span>
<span sid='48723' title='48723'>I was uneasy about Sir Henry.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48724' title='48724'>'Why about Sir Henry in particular?' </span>
<span sid='48725' title='48725'>I could not help asking.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48726' title='48726'>'Because I had suggested that he should come over. </span>
<span sid='48727' title='48727'>When he did not come I was surprised, and I naturally became alarmed for his safety when I heard cries upon the moor. </span>
<span sid='48728' title='48728'>By the way' - his eyes darted again from my face to Holmes's-'did you hear anything else besides a cry?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48729' title='48729'>'No,' said Holmes, 'did you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48730' title='48730'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48731' title='48731'>'What do you mean then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48732' title='48732'>'Oh, you know the stories that the peasants tell about a phantom hound, and so on. </span>
<span sid='48733' title='48733'>It is said to be heard at night upon the moor. </span>
<span sid='48734' title='48734'>I was wondering if there were any evidence of such a sound to-night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48735' title='48735'>'We heard nothing of the kind,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48736' title='48736'>'And what is your theory of this poor fellow's death?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48737' title='48737'>'I have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off his head. </span>
<span sid='48738' title='48738'>He has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and eventually fallen over here and broken his neck.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48739' title='48739'>'That seems the most reasonable theory,' said Stapleton, and he gave a sigh which I took to indicate his relief. </span>
<span sid='48740' title='48740'>'What do you think about it, Mr Sherlock Holmes?' </span>
<span sid='48741' title='48741'>My friend bowed his compliments.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48742' title='48742'>'You are quick at identification,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48743' title='48743'>'We have been expecting you in these parts since Dr Watson came down. </span>
<span sid='48744' title='48744'>You are in time to see a tragedy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48745' title='48745'>'Yes, indeed. </span>
<span sid='48746' title='48746'>I have no doubt that my friend's explanation will cover the facts. </span>
<span sid='48747' title='48747'>I will take an unpleasant remembrance back to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> with me to-morrow.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48748' title='48748'>'Oh, you return to-morrow?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48749' title='48749'>'That is my intention.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48750' title='48750'>'I hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences which have puzzled us?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48751' title='48751'>Holmes shrugged his shoulders. </span>
<span sid='48752' title='48752'>'One cannot always have the success for which one hopes. </span>
<span sid='48753' title='48753'>An investigator needs facts, and not legends or rumours. </span>
<span sid='48754' title='48754'>It has not been a satisfactory case.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48755' title='48755'>My friend spoke in his frankest and most unconcerned manner. </span>
<span sid='48756' title='48756'>Stapleton still looked hard at him. </span>
<span sid='48757' title='48757'>Then he turned to me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48758' title='48758'>'I would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my house, but it would give my sister such a fright that I do not feel justified in doing it. </span>
<span sid='48759' title='48759'>I think that if we put something over his face he will be safe until morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48760' title='48760'>And so it was arranged. </span>
<span sid='48761' title='48761'>Resisting Stapleton's offer of hospitality, Holmes and I set off to Baskerville Hall, leaving the naturalist to return alone. </span>
<span sid='48762' title='48762'>Looking back we saw the figure moving slowly away over the broad moor, and behind him that one black smudge on the silvered slope which showed where the man was lying who had come so horribly to his end.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48763' title='48763'>'We're at close grips at last,' said Holmes, as we walked together across the moor. </span>
<span sid='48764' title='48764'>'What a nerve the fellow has! </span>
<span sid='48765' title='48765'>How he pulled himself together in the face of what must have been a paralysing shock when he found that the wrong man had fallen a victim to his plot. </span>
<span sid='48766' title='48766'>I told you in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, Watson, and will tell you now again, that we have never had a foeman more worthy of our steel.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48767' title='48767'>'I am sorry that he has seen you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48768' title='48768'>'And so was I at first. </span>
<span sid='48769' title='48769'>But there was no getting out of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48770' title='48770'>'What effect do you think it will have upon his plans, now that he knows you are here?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48771' title='48771'>'It may cause him to be more cautious, or it may drive him to desperate measures at once. </span>
<span sid='48772' title='48772'>Like most clever criminals, he may be too confident in his own cleverness and imagine that he has completely deceived us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48773' title='48773'>'Why should we not arrest him at once?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48774' title='48774'>'My dear Watson, you were born to be a man of action. </span>
<span sid='48775' title='48775'>Your instinct is always to do something energetic. </span>
<span sid='48776' title='48776'>But supposing, for argument's sake, that we had him arrested to-night, what on earth the better off should we be for that? </span>
<span sid='48777' title='48777'>We could prove nothing against him. </span>
<span sid='48778' title='48778'>There's the devilish cunning of it! </span>
<span sid='48779' title='48779'>If he were acting through a human agent we could get some evidence, but if we were to drag this great dog to the light of day it would not help in putting a rope round the neck of its master.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48780' title='48780'>'Surely we have a case.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48781' title='48781'>'Not a shadow of one - only surmise and conjecture. </span>
<span sid='48782' title='48782'>We should be laughed out of court if we came with such a story and such evidence.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48783' title='48783'>'There is Sir Charles's death.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48784' title='48784'>'Found dead without a mark upon him. </span>
<span sid='48785' title='48785'>You and I know that he died of sheer fright, and we know also what frightened him., but how are we to get twelve stolid jurymen to know it? </span>
<span sid='48786' title='48786'>What signs are there of a hound? </span>
<span sid='48787' title='48787'>Where are the marks of its fangs? </span>
<span sid='48788' title='48788'>Of course, we know that a hound does not bite a dead body, and that Sir Charles was dead before ever the brute overtook him. </span>
<span sid='48789' title='48789'>But we have to prove all this, and we are not in a position to do it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48790' title='48790'>'Well, then, to-night?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48791' title='48791'>'We are not much better off to-night. </span>
<span sid='48792' title='48792'>Again, there was no direct connection between the hound and the man's death. </span>
<span sid='48793' title='48793'>We never saw the hound. </span>
<span sid='48794' title='48794'>We heard it, but we could not prove that it was running upon this man's trail. </span>
<span sid='48795' title='48795'>There is a complete absence of motive. </span>
<span sid='48796' title='48796'>No, my dear fellow, we must reconcile ourselves to the fact that we have no case at present, and that it is worth our while to run any risk in order to establish one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48797' title='48797'>'And how do you propose to do so?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48798' title='48798'>'I have great hopes of what Mrs Laura <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lyons&t=h'>Lyons</a> may do for us when the position of affairs is made clear to her. </span>
<span sid='48799' title='48799'>And I have my own plan as well. </span>
<span sid='48800' title='48800'>Sufficient for to-morrow is the evil thereof, but I hope before the day is past to have the upper hand at last.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48801' title='48801'>I could draw nothing further from him, and he walked, lost in thought, as far as the Baskerville gates.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48802' title='48802'>'Are you coming up?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48803' title='48803'>'Yes, I see no reason for further concealment. </span>
<span sid='48804' title='48804'>But one last word, Watson. </span>
<span sid='48805' title='48805'>Say nothing of the hound to Sir Henry. </span>
<span sid='48806' title='48806'>Let him think that Selden's death was as Stapleton would have us believe. </span>
<span sid='48807' title='48807'>He will have a better nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergo to-morrow, when he is engaged, if I remember your report aright, to dine with these people.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48808' title='48808'>'And so am I.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48809' title='48809'>'Then you must excuse yourself, and he must go alone. </span>
<span sid='48810' title='48810'>That will be easily arranged. </span>
<span sid='48811' title='48811'>And now, if we are too late for dinner, I think that we are both ready for our suppers.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48812' title='48812'>CHAPTER 13 : Fixing the Nets</span>
<p>
<span sid='48813' title='48813'>Sir Henry was more pleased than surprised to see Sherlock Holmes, for he had for some days been expecting that recent events would bring him down from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='48814' title='48814'>He did raise his eyebrows, however, when he found that my friend had neither any luggage nor any explanations for its absence. </span>
<span sid='48815' title='48815'>Between us we soon supplied his wants, and then over a belated supper we explained to the Baronet as much of our experience as it seemed desirable that he should know. </span>
<span sid='48816' title='48816'>But first I had the unpleasant duty of breaking the news of Selden's death to Barrymore and his wife. </span>
<span sid='48817' title='48817'>To him it may have been an unmitigated relief, but she wept bitterly in her apron. </span>
<span sid='48818' title='48818'>To all the world he was the man of violence, half animal and half demon, but to her he always remained the little wilful boy of her own girlhood, the child who had clung to her hand. </span>
<span sid='48819' title='48819'>Evil indeed is the man who has not one woman to mourn him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48820' title='48820'>'I've been moping in the house all day since Watson went off in the morning,' said the baronet. </span>
<span sid='48821' title='48821'>'I guess I should have some credit, for I have kept my promise. </span>
<span sid='48822' title='48822'>If I hadn't sworn not to go about alone I might have had a more lively evening, for I had a message from Stapleton asking me over there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48823' title='48823'>'I have no doubt that you would have had a more lively evening,' said Holmes, drily. </span>
<span sid='48824' title='48824'>'By the way, I don't suppose you appreciate that we have been mourning over you as having broken your neck?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48825' title='48825'>Sir Henry opened his eyes. </span>
<span sid='48826' title='48826'>'How was that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48827' title='48827'>'This poor wretch was dressed in your clothes. </span>
<span sid='48828' title='48828'>I fear your servant who gave them to him may get into trouble with the police.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48829' title='48829'>'That is unlikely. </span>
<span sid='48830' title='48830'>There was no mark on any of them, so far as I know.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48831' title='48831'>'That's lucky for him - in fact, it's lucky for all of you, since you are all on the wrong side of the law in this matter. </span>
<span sid='48832' title='48832'>I am not sure that as a conscientious detective my first duty is not to arrest the whole household. </span>
<span sid='48833' title='48833'>Watson's reports are most incriminating documents.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48834' title='48834'>'But how about the case?' asked the baronet. </span>
<span sid='48835' title='48835'>'Have you made anything out of the tangle? </span>
<span sid='48836' title='48836'>I don't know that Watson and I are much the wiser since we came down.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48837' title='48837'>'I think that I shall be in a position to make the situation rather more clear to you before long. </span>
<span sid='48838' title='48838'>It has been an exceedingly difficult and most complicated business. </span>
<span sid='48839' title='48839'>There are several points upon which we still want light - but it is coming, all the same.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48840' title='48840'>'We've had one experience, as Watson has no doubt told you. </span>
<span sid='48841' title='48841'>We heard the hound on the moor, so I can swear that it is not all empty superstition. </span>
<span sid='48842' title='48842'>I had something to do with dogs when I was out West, and I know one when I hear one. </span>
<span sid='48843' title='48843'>If you can muzzle that one and put him on a chain I'll be ready to swear you are the greatest detective of all time.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48844' title='48844'>'I think I will muzzle him and chain him all right if you will give me your help.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48845' title='48845'>'Whatever you tell me to do I will do.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48846' title='48846'>'Very good, and I will ask you also to do it blindly, without always asking the reason.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48847' title='48847'>'Just as you like.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48848' title='48848'>'If you will do this I think the chances are that our little problem will soon be solved. </span>
<span sid='48849' title='48849'>I have no doubt-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48850' title='48850'>He stopped suddenly and stared fixedly up over my head into the air. </span>
<span sid='48851' title='48851'>The lamp beat upon his face, and so intent was it and so still that it might have been that of a clear-cut classical statue, a personification of alertness and expectation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48852' title='48852'>'What is it?' we both cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48853' title='48853'>I could see as he looked down that he was repressing some internal emotion. </span>
<span sid='48854' title='48854'>His features were still composed, but his eyes shone with amused exultation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48855' title='48855'>'Excuse the admiration of a connoisseur,' said he, as he waved his hand towards the line of portraits which covered the opposite wall. </span>
<span sid='48856' title='48856'>'Watson won't allow that I know anything of art, but that is mere jealousy, because our views upon the subject differ. </span>
<span sid='48857' title='48857'>Now, these are a really very fine series of portraits.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48858' title='48858'>'Well, I'm glad to hear you say so,' said Sir Henry, glancing with some surprise at my friend. </span>
<span sid='48859' title='48859'>'I don't pretend to know much about these things, and I'd be a better judge of a horse or a steer than of a picture. </span>
<span sid='48860' title='48860'>I didn't know that you found time for such things.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48861' title='48861'>'I know what is good when I see it, and I see it now. </span>
<span sid='48862' title='48862'>That's a Kneller, I'll swear, that lady in the blue silk over yonder, and the stout gentleman with the wig ought to be a Reynolds. </span>
<span sid='48863' title='48863'>They are all family portraits, I presume?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48864' title='48864'>'Every one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48865' title='48865'>'Do you know the names?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48866' title='48866'>' Barrymore has been coaching me in them, and I think I can say my lessons fairly well.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48867' title='48867'>'Who is the gentleman with the telescope?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48868' title='48868'>'That is Rear-Admiral Baskerville, who served under Rodney in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the West&t=h'>the West</a> Indies. </span>
<span sid='48869' title='48869'>The man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is Sir William Baskerville, who was Chairman of Committees of the House of Commons under Pitt.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48870' title='48870'>'And this Cavalier opposite to me - the one with the black velvet and the lace?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48871' title='48871'>'Ah, you have a right to know about him. </span>
<span sid='48872' title='48872'>That is the cause of all the mischief, the wicked Hugo, who started the Hound of the Baskervilles. </span>
<span sid='48873' title='48873'>We're not likely to forget him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48874' title='48874'>I gazed with interest and some surprise upon the portrait.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48875' title='48875'>'Dear me!' said Holmes, 'he seems a quiet, meek-mannered man enough, but I dare say that there was a lurking devil in his eyes. </span>
<span sid='48876' title='48876'>I had pictured him as a more robust and ruffianly person.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48877' title='48877'>'There's no doubt about the authenticity, for the name and the date, 1647, are on the back of the canvas.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48878' title='48878'>Holmes said little more, but the picture of the old roysterer seemed to have a fascination for him, and his eyes were continually fixed upon it during supper. </span>
<span sid='48879' title='48879'>It was not until later, when Sir Henry had gone to his room, that I was able to follow the trend of his thoughts. </span>
<span sid='48880' title='48880'>He led me back into the banqueting-hall, his bedroom candle in his hand, and he held it up against the time-stained portrait on the wall.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48881' title='48881'>'Do you see anything there?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48882' title='48882'>I looked at the broad plumed hat, the curling love-locks, the white lace collar, and the straight severe face which was framed between them. </span>
<span sid='48883' title='48883'>It was not a brutal countenance, but it was prim, hard, and stern, with a firm-set, thin-lipped mouth, and a coldly intolerant eye.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48884' title='48884'>'Is it like anyone you know?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48885' title='48885'>'There is something of Sir Henry about the jaw.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48886' title='48886'>'Just a suggestion, perhaps. </span>
<span sid='48887' title='48887'>But wait an instant!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48888' title='48888'>He stood upon a chair, and holding up the light in his left hand, he curved his right arm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48889' title='48889'>'Good heavens!' I cried, in amazement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48890' title='48890'>The face of Stapleton had sprung out of the canvas.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48891' title='48891'>'Ha, you see it now. </span>
<span sid='48892' title='48892'>My eyes have been trained to examine faces and not their trimmings. </span>
<span sid='48893' title='48893'>It is the first quality of a criminal investigator that he should see through a disguise.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48894' title='48894'>'But this is marvellous. </span>
<span sid='48895' title='48895'>It might be his portrait.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48896' title='48896'>'Yes, it is an interesting instance of a throw-back, which appears to be both physical and spiritual. </span>
<span sid='48897' title='48897'>A study of family portraits is enough to convert a man to the doctrine of reincarnation. </span>
<span sid='48898' title='48898'>The fellow is a Baskerville - that is evident.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48899' title='48899'>'With designs upon the succession.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48900' title='48900'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='48901' title='48901'>This chance of the picture has supplied us with one of our most obvious missing links. </span>
<span sid='48902' title='48902'>We have him, Watson, we have him, and I dare swear that before to-morrow night he will be fluttering in our net as helpless as one of his own butterflies. </span>
<span sid='48903' title='48903'>A pin, a cork, and a card, and we add him to the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> collection!' </span>
<span sid='48904' title='48904'>He burst into one of his rare fits of laughter as he turned away from the picture. </span>
<span sid='48905' title='48905'>I have not heard him laugh often, and it has always boded ill to somebody.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48906' title='48906'>I was up betimes in the morning, but Holmes was afoot earlier still, for I saw him as I dressed coming up the drive.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48907' title='48907'>'Yes, we should have a full day to-day,' he remarked, and he rubbed his hands with the joy of action. </span>
<span sid='48908' title='48908'>'The nets are all in place, and the drag is about to begin. </span>
<span sid='48909' title='48909'>We'll know before the day is out whether we have caught our big, lean-jawed pike, or whether he has got through the meshes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48910' title='48910'>'Have you been on the moor already?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48911' title='48911'>'I have sent a report from Grimpen to Princetown as to the death of Selden. </span>
<span sid='48912' title='48912'>I think I can promise that none of you will be troubled in the matter. </span>
<span sid='48913' title='48913'>And I have also communicated with my faithful Cartwright, who would certainly have pined away at the door of my hut as a dog does at his master's grave if I had not set his mind at rest about my safety.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48914' title='48914'>'What is the next move?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48915' title='48915'>'To see Sir Henry. </span>
<span sid='48916' title='48916'>Ah, here he is!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48917' title='48917'>'Good morning, Holmes,' said the baronet. </span>
<span sid='48918' title='48918'>'You look like a general who is planning a battle with his chief of the staff.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48919' title='48919'>'That is the exact situation. </span>
<span sid='48920' title='48920'>Watson was asking for orders.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48921' title='48921'>'And so, do I.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48922' title='48922'>'Very good. </span>
<span sid='48923' title='48923'>You are engaged, as I understand, to dine with our friends the Stapletons to-night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48924' title='48924'>'I hope that you will come also. </span>
<span sid='48925' title='48925'>They are very hospitable people, and I am sure that they would be very glad to see you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48926' title='48926'>'I fear that Watson and I must go to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48927' title='48927'>'To <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48928' title='48928'>'Yes, I think that we should be more useful there at the present juncture.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48929' title='48929'>The baronet's face perceptibly lengthened. </span>
<span sid='48930' title='48930'>'I hoped that you were going to see me through this business. </span>
<span sid='48931' title='48931'>The Hall and the moor are not very pleasant places when one is alone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48932' title='48932'>'My dear fellow, you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what I tell you. </span>
<span sid='48933' title='48933'>You can tell your friends that we should have been happy to have come with you, but that urgent business required us to be in town. </span>
<span sid='48934' title='48934'>'We hope very soon to return to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Devonshire&t=h'>Devonshire</a>. </span>
<span sid='48935' title='48935'>Will you remember to give them that message?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48936' title='48936'>'If you insist upon it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48937' title='48937'>'There is no alternative, I assure you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48938' title='48938'>I saw by the Baronet's clouded brow that he was deeply hurt by what he regarded as our desertion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48939' title='48939'>'When do you desire to go?' he asked, coldly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48940' title='48940'>'Immediately after breakfast. </span>
<span sid='48941' title='48941'>We will drive in to Coombe Tracey, but Watson will leave his things as a pledge that he will come back to you. </span>
<span sid='48942' title='48942'>Watson, you will send a note to Stapleton to tell him that you regret that you cannot come.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48943' title='48943'>'I have a good mind to go to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> with you,' said the Baronet. </span>
<span sid='48944' title='48944'>'Why should I stay here alone?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48945' title='48945'>'Because it is your post of duty. </span>
<span sid='48946' title='48946'>Because you gave me your word that you would do as you were told, and I tell you to stay.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48947' title='48947'>'All right, then, I'll stay.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48948' title='48948'>'One more direction! </span>
<span sid='48949' title='48949'>I wish you to drive to Merripit House. </span>
<span sid='48950' title='48950'>Send back your trap, however, and let them know that you intend to walk home.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48951' title='48951'>'To walk across the moor?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48952' title='48952'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48953' title='48953'>'But that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned me not to do.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48954' title='48954'>'This time you may do it with safety. </span>
<span sid='48955' title='48955'>If I had not every confidence in your nerve and courage I would not suggest it, but it is essential that you should do it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48956' title='48956'>'Then I will do it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48957' title='48957'>'And as you value your life do not go across the moor in any direction save along the straight path which leads from Merripit House to the Grimpen Road, and is your natural way home.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48958' title='48958'>'I will do just what you say.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48959' title='48959'>'Very good. </span>
<span sid='48960' title='48960'>I should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast as possible, so as to reach <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> in the afternoon.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48961' title='48961'>I was much astounded by this programme, though I remembered that Holmes had said to Stapleton on the night before that his visit would terminate next day. </span>
<span sid='48962' title='48962'>It had not crossed my mind, however, that he would wish me to go with him, nor could I understand how we could both be absent at a moment which he himself declared to be critical. </span>
<span sid='48963' title='48963'>There was nothing for it, however, but implicit obedience, so we bade good-bye to our rueful friend, and a couple of hours afterwards we were at the station of Coombe Tracey and had dispatched the trap upon its return journey. </span>
<span sid='48964' title='48964'>A small boy was waiting upon the platform.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48965' title='48965'>'Any orders, sir?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48966' title='48966'>'You will take this train to town, Cartwright. </span>
<span sid='48967' title='48967'>The moment you arrive you will send a wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, in my name, to say that if he finds the pocket-book which I have dropped he is to send it by registered post to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48968' title='48968'>'Yes, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48969' title='48969'>'And ask at the station office if there is a message for me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48970' title='48970'>The boy returned with a telegram, which Holmes handed to me. </span>
<span sid='48971' title='48971'>It ran:</span>
<p>
<span sid='48972' title='48972'>Wire received. </span>
<span sid='48973' title='48973'>Coming down with unsigned warrant. </span>
<span sid='48974' title='48974'>Arrive five-forty </span>
<span sid='48975' title='48975'>- LESTRADE.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48976' title='48976'>'That is in answer to mine of this morning. </span>
<span sid='48977' title='48977'>He is the best of the professionals, I think, and we may need his assistance. </span>
<span sid='48978' title='48978'>Now, Watson, I think that we cannot employ our time better than by calling upon your acquaintance, Mrs Laura <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lyons&t=h'>Lyons</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48979' title='48979'>His plan of campaign was beginning to be evident. </span>
<span sid='48980' title='48980'>He would use the baronet in order to convince the Stapletons that we were really gone, while we would actually return at the instant when we were likely to be needed. </span>
<span sid='48981' title='48981'>That telegram from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, if mentioned by Sir Henry to the Stapletons, must remove the last suspicions from their minds. </span>
<span sid='48982' title='48982'>Already I seemed to see our nets drawing close round that lean-jawed pike.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48983' title='48983'>Mrs Laura <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lyons&t=h'>Lyons</a> was in her office, and Sherlock Holmes opened his interview with a frankness and directness which considerably amazed her.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48984' title='48984'>'I am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of the late Sir Charles Baskerville,' said he. </span>
<span sid='48985' title='48985'>'My friend here, Dr Watson, has informed me of what you have communicated, and also of what you have withheld in connection with that matter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48986' title='48986'>'What have I withheld?' she asked defiantly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48987' title='48987'>'You have confessed that you asked Sir Charles to be at the gate at ten o'clock. </span>
<span sid='48988' title='48988'>We know that that was the place and hour of his death. </span>
<span sid='48989' title='48989'>You have withheld what the connection is between these events.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48990' title='48990'>'There is no connection.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48991' title='48991'>'In that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary one. </span>
<span sid='48992' title='48992'>But I think that we shall succeed in establishing a connection after all. </span>
<span sid='48993' title='48993'>I wish to be perfectly frank with you, Mrs <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lyons&t=h'>Lyons</a>. </span>
<span sid='48994' title='48994'>We regard this case as one of murder, and the evidence may implicate not only your friend Mr Stapleton, but his wife as well.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48995' title='48995'>The lady sprang from her chair. </span>
<span sid='48996' title='48996'>'His wife!' she cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='48997' title='48997'>'The fact is no longer a secret. </span>
<span sid='48998' title='48998'>The person who has passed for his sister is really his wife.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='48999' title='48999'>Mrs <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lyons&t=h'>Lyons</a> had resumed her seat. </span>
<span sid='49000' title='49000'>Her hands were grasping the arms of her chair, and I saw that the pink nails had turned white with the pressure of her grip.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49001' title='49001'>'His wife!' she said, again. </span>
<span sid='49002' title='49002'>'His wife! </span>
<span sid='49003' title='49003'>He was not a married man.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49004' title='49004'>Sherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49005' title='49005'>'Prove it to me! </span>
<span sid='49006' title='49006'>Prove it to me! </span>
<span sid='49007' title='49007'>And if you can do so-!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49008' title='49008'>The fierce flash of her eyes said more than any words.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49009' title='49009'>'I have come prepared to do so,' said Holmes, drawing several papers from his pocket. </span>
<span sid='49010' title='49010'>'Here is a photograph of the couple taken in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=York&t=h'>York</a> four years ago. </span>
<span sid='49011' title='49011'>It is endorsed "Mr and Mrs Vandeleur", but you will have no difficulty in recognising him, and her also, if you know her by sight. </span>
<span sid='49012' title='49012'>Here are three written descriptions by trustworthy witnesses of Mr and Mrs Vandeleur, who at that time kept St Oliver's private school. </span>
<span sid='49013' title='49013'>Read them, and see if you can doubt the identity of these people.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49014' title='49014'>She glanced at them, and then looked up at us with the set, rigid face of a desperate woman.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49015' title='49015'>'Mr Holmes,' she said, 'this man had offered me marriage on condition that I could get a divorce from my husband. </span>
<span sid='49016' title='49016'>He has lied to me, the villain, in every conceivable way. </span>
<span sid='49017' title='49017'>Not one word of truth has he ever told me. </span>
<span sid='49018' title='49018'>And why - why? </span>
<span sid='49019' title='49019'>I imagined that all was for my own sake. </span>
<span sid='49020' title='49020'>But now I see that I was never anything but a tool in his hands. </span>
<span sid='49021' title='49021'>Why should I preserve faith with him who never kept any with me? </span>
<span sid='49022' title='49022'>Why should I try to shield him from the consequences of his own wicked acts? </span>
<span sid='49023' title='49023'>Ask me what you like, and there is nothing which I shall hold back. </span>
<span sid='49024' title='49024'>One thing I swear to you, and that is, that when I wrote the letter I never dreamed of any harm to the old gentleman, who had been my kindest friend.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49025' title='49025'>'I entirely believe you, madam,' said Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='49026' title='49026'>'The recital of these events must be very painful to you, and perhaps it will make it easier if I tell you what occurred, and you can check me if I make any material mistake. </span>
<span sid='49027' title='49027'>The sending of this letter was suggested to you by Stapleton?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49028' title='49028'>'He dictated it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49029' title='49029'>'I presume that the reason he gave was that you would receive help from Sir Charles for the legal expenses connected with your divorce?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49030' title='49030'>'Exactly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49031' title='49031'>'And then after you had sent the letter he dissuaded you from keeping the appointment?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49032' title='49032'>'He told me that it would hurt his self-respect that any other man should find the money for such an object, and that though he was a poor man himself he would devote his last penny to removing the obstacles which divided us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49033' title='49033'>'He appears to be a very consistent character. </span>
<span sid='49034' title='49034'>And then you heard nothing until you read the reports of the death in the paper?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49035' title='49035'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49036' title='49036'>'And he made you swear to say nothing about your appointment with Sir Charles?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49037' title='49037'>'He did. </span>
<span sid='49038' title='49038'>He said that the death was a very mysterious one, and that I should certainly be suspected if the facts came out. </span>
<span sid='49039' title='49039'>He frightened me into remaining silent.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49040' title='49040'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='49041' title='49041'>But you had your suspicions?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49042' title='49042'>She hesitated and looked down.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49043' title='49043'>'I knew him,' she said. </span>
<span sid='49044' title='49044'>'But if he had kept faith with me I should always have done so with him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49045' title='49045'>'I think that on the whole you have had a fortunate escape,' said Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='49046' title='49046'>'You have had him in your power and he knew it, and yet you are alive. </span>
<span sid='49047' title='49047'>You have been walking for some months very near to the edge of a precipice. </span>
<span sid='49048' title='49048'>We must wish you good morning now, Mrs <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lyons&t=h'>Lyons</a>, and it is probable that you will very shortly hear from us again.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49049' title='49049'>'Our case becomes rounded off, and difficulty after difficulty thins away in front of us,' said Holmes as we stood waiting for the arrival of the express from town. </span>
<span sid='49050' title='49050'>'I shall soon be in the position of being able to put into a single connected narrative one of the most singular and sensational crimes of modern times. </span>
<span sid='49051' title='49051'>Students of criminology will remember the analogous incidents in Grodno, in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Little <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Russia&t=h'>Russia</a>&t=h'>Little <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Russia&t=h'>Russia</a></a>, in the year '66, and of course there are the Anderson murders in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=North Carolina&t=h'>North Carolina</a>, but this case possesses some features which are entirely its own. </span>
<span sid='49052' title='49052'>Even now we have no clear case against this very wily man. </span>
<span sid='49053' title='49053'>But I shall be very much surprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49054' title='49054'>The <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> express came roaring into the station, and a small, wiry bulldog of a man had sprung from a first-class carriage. </span>
<span sid='49055' title='49055'>We all three shook hands, and I saw at once from the reverential way in which Lestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned a good deal since the days when they had first worked together. </span>
<span sid='49056' title='49056'>I could well remember the scorn which the theories of the reasoner used then to excite in the practical man.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49057' title='49057'>'Anything good?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49058' title='49058'>'The biggest thing for years,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='49059' title='49059'>'We have two hours before we need think of starting. </span>
<span sid='49060' title='49060'>I think we might employ it in getting some dinner, and then, Lestrade, we will take the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> fog out of your throat by giving you a breath of the pure night air of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Dartmoor&t=h'>Dartmoor</a>. </span>
<span sid='49061' title='49061'>Never been there? </span>
<span sid='49062' title='49062'>Ah, well, I don't suppose you will forget your first visit.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49063' title='49063'>CHAPTER 14 : The Hound of the Baskervilles</span>
<p>
<span sid='49064' title='49064'>One of Sherlock Holmes's defects - if, indeed, one may call it a defect - was that he was exceedingly loth to communicate his full plans to any other person until the instant of their fulfilment. </span>
<span sid='49065' title='49065'>Partly it came no doubt from his own masterful nature, which loved to dominate and surprise those who were around him. </span>
<span sid='49066' title='49066'>Partly also from his professional caution, which urged him never to take any chances. </span>
<span sid='49067' title='49067'>The result, however, was very trying for those who were acting as his agents and assistants. </span>
<span sid='49068' title='49068'>I had often suffered under it, but never more so than during that long drive in the darkness. </span>
<span sid='49069' title='49069'>The great ordeal was in front of us, at last we were about to make our final effort, and yet Holmes had said nothing, and I could only surmise what his course of action would be. </span>
<span sid='49070' title='49070'>My nerves thrilled with anticipation when at last the cold wind upon our faces and the dark, void spaces on either side of the narrow road told me that we were back upon the moor once again. </span>
<span sid='49071' title='49071'>Every stride of the horses and every turn of the wheels was taking us nearer to our supreme adventure.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49072' title='49072'>Our conversation was hampered by the presence of the driver of the hired wagonette, so that we were forced to talk of trivial matters when our nerves were tense with emotion and anticipation. </span>
<span sid='49073' title='49073'>It was a relief to me, after that unnatural restraint, when we at last passed Frankland's house and knew that we were drawing near to the Hall and to the scene of action. </span>
<span sid='49074' title='49074'>We did not drive up to the door, but got down near the gate of the avenue. </span>
<span sid='49075' title='49075'>The wagonette was paid off and ordered to return to Coombe Tracey forthwith, while we started to walk to Merripit House.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49076' title='49076'>'Are you armed, Lestrade?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49077' title='49077'>The little detective smiled. </span>
<span sid='49078' title='49078'>'As long as I have my trousers I have a hip-pocket, and as long as I have my hip-pocket I have something in it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49079' title='49079'>'Good! </span>
<span sid='49080' title='49080'>My friend and I are also ready for emergencies.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49081' title='49081'>'You're mighty close about this affair, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='49082' title='49082'>What's the game now?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49083' title='49083'>'A waiting game.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49084' title='49084'>'My word, it does not seem a very cheerful place,' said the detective, with a shiver, glancing round him at the gloomy slopes of the hill and at the huge lake of fog which lay over the Grimpen Mire. </span>
<span sid='49085' title='49085'>'I see the lights of a house ahead of us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49086' title='49086'>'That is Merripit House and the end of our journey. </span>
<span sid='49087' title='49087'>I must request you to walk on tip-toe and not to talk above a whisper.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49088' title='49088'>We moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for the house, but Holmes halted us when we were about two hundred yards from it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49089' title='49089'>'This will do,' said he. </span>
<span sid='49090' title='49090'>'These rocks upon the right make an admirable screen.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49091' title='49091'>'We are to wait here?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49092' title='49092'>'Yes, we shall make our little ambush here. </span>
<span sid='49093' title='49093'>Get into this hollow, Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='49094' title='49094'>You have been inside the house, have you not, Watson? </span>
<span sid='49095' title='49095'>Can you tell the position of the rooms? </span>
<span sid='49096' title='49096'>What are those latticed windows at this end?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49097' title='49097'>'I think they are the kitchen windows.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49098' title='49098'>'And the one beyond, which shines so brightly?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49099' title='49099'>'That is certainly the dining-room.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49100' title='49100'>'The blinds are up. </span>
<span sid='49101' title='49101'>You know the lie of the land best. </span>
<span sid='49102' title='49102'>Creep forward quietly and see what they are doing - but for Heaven's sake don't let them know that they are watched!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49103' title='49103'>I tip-toed down the path and stooped behind the low wall which surrounded the stunted orchard. </span>
<span sid='49104' title='49104'>Creeping in its shadow, I reached a point whence I could look straight through the uncurtained window.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49105' title='49105'>There were only two men in the room, Sir Henry and Stapleton. </span>
<span sid='49106' title='49106'>They sat with their profiles towards me on either side of the round table. </span>
<span sid='49107' title='49107'>Both of them were smoking cigars, and coffee and wine were in front of them. </span>
<span sid='49108' title='49108'>Stapleton was talking with animation, but the Baronet looked pale and distrait. </span>
<span sid='49109' title='49109'>Perhaps the thought of that lonely walk across the ill-omened moor was weighing heavily upon his mind.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49110' title='49110'>As I watched them Stapleton rose and left the room, while Sir Henry filled his glass again and leaned back in his chair, puffing at his cigar. </span>
<span sid='49111' title='49111'>I heard the creak of a door and the crisp sound of boots upon gravel. </span>
<span sid='49112' title='49112'>The steps passed along the path on the other side of the wall under which I crouched. </span>
<span sid='49113' title='49113'>Looking over, I saw the naturalist pause at the door of an out-house in the corner of the orchard. </span>
<span sid='49114' title='49114'>A key turned in a lock, and as he passed in there was a curious scuffling noise from within. </span>
<span sid='49115' title='49115'>He was only a minute or so inside, and then I heard the key turn once more, and he passed me and re-entered the house. </span>
<span sid='49116' title='49116'>I saw him rejoin his guest and I crept quietly back to where my companions were waiting to tell them what I had seen.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49117' title='49117'>'You say, Watson, that the lady is not there?' Holmes asked, when I had finished my report.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49118' title='49118'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49119' title='49119'>'Where can she be, then, since there is no light in any other room except the kitchen?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49120' title='49120'>'I cannot think where she is.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49121' title='49121'>I have said that over the great Grimpen Mire there hung a dense, white fog. </span>
<span sid='49122' title='49122'>It was drifting slowly in our direction and banked itself up like a wall on that side of us, low, but thick and well defined. </span>
<span sid='49123' title='49123'>The moon shone on it, and it looked like a great shimmering ice-field, with the heads of the distant tors as rocks borne upon its surface. </span>
<span sid='49124' title='49124'>Holmes's face was turned towards it, and he muttered impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49125' title='49125'>'It's moving towards us, Watson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49126' title='49126'>'Is that serious?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49127' title='49127'>'Very serious, indeed - the one thing upon earth which could have disarranged my plans. </span>
<span sid='49128' title='49128'>He can't be very long now. </span>
<span sid='49129' title='49129'>It is already ten o'clock. </span>
<span sid='49130' title='49130'>Our success and even his life may depend upon his coming out before the fog is over the path.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49131' title='49131'>The night was clear and fine above us. </span>
<span sid='49132' title='49132'>The stars shone cold and bright, while a half-moon bathed the whole scene in a soft, uncertain light. </span>
<span sid='49133' title='49133'>Before us lay the dark bulk of the house, its serrated roof and bristling chimneys hard outlined against the silver-spangled sky. </span>
<span sid='49134' title='49134'>Broad bars of golden light from the lower windows stretched across the orchard and the moor. </span>
<span sid='49135' title='49135'>One of them was suddenly shut off. </span>
<span sid='49136' title='49136'>The servants had left the kitchen. </span>
<span sid='49137' title='49137'>There only remained the lamp in the dining-room where the two men, the murderous host and the unconscious guest, still chatted over their cigars. </span>
<span sid='49138' title='49138'>Every minute that white woolly plain which covered one half of the moor was drifting closer and closer to the house. </span>
<span sid='49139' title='49139'>Already the first thin wisps of it were curling across the golden square of the lighted window. </span>
<span sid='49140' title='49140'>The farther wall of the orchard was already invisible, and the trees were standing out of a swirl of white vapour. </span>
<span sid='49141' title='49141'>As we watched it the fog-wreaths came crawling round both comers of the house and rolled slowly into one dense bank, on which the upper floor and the roof floated like a strange ship upon a shadowy sea. </span>
<span sid='49142' title='49142'>Holmes struck his hand passionately upon the rock in front of us, and stamped his feet in his impatience.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49143' title='49143'>'If he isn't out in a quarter of an hour the path will be covered. </span>
<span sid='49144' title='49144'>In half an hour we won't be able to see our hands in front of us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49145' title='49145'>'Shall we move farther back upon higher ground?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49146' title='49146'>'Yes, I think it would be as well.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49147' title='49147'>So as the fog-bank flowed onwards we fell back before it until we were half a mile from the house, and still that dense white sea, with the moon silvering its upper edge, swept slowly and inexorably on.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49148' title='49148'>'We are going too far,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='49149' title='49149'>'We dare not take the chance of his being overtaken before he can reach us. </span>
<span sid='49150' title='49150'>At all costs we must hold our ground where we are.' </span>
<span sid='49151' title='49151'>He dropped on his knees and clapped his ear to the ground. </span>
<span sid='49152' title='49152'>'Thank God, I think that I hear him coming.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49153' title='49153'>A sound of quick steps broke the silence of the moor. </span>
<span sid='49154' title='49154'>Crouching among the stones, we stared intently at the silver-tipped bank in front of us. </span>
<span sid='49155' title='49155'>The steps grew louder, and through the fog, as through a curtain, there stepped the man whom we were awaiting. </span>
<span sid='49156' title='49156'>He looked round him in surprise as he emerged into the clear, star-lit night. </span>
<span sid='49157' title='49157'>Then he came swiftly along the path, passed close to where we lay, and went on up the long slope behind us. </span>
<span sid='49158' title='49158'>As he walked he glanced continually over either shoulder, like a man who is ill at ease.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49159' title='49159'>'Hist!' cried Holmes, and I heard the sharp click of a cocking pistol. </span>
<span sid='49160' title='49160'>'Look out! </span>
<span sid='49161' title='49161'>It's coming!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49162' title='49162'>There was a thin, crisp, continuous patter from somewhere in the heart of that crawling bank. </span>
<span sid='49163' title='49163'>The cloud was within fifty yards of where we lay, and we glared at it, all three, uncertain what horror was about to break from the heart of it. </span>
<span sid='49164' title='49164'>I was at Holmes's elbow, and I glanced for an instant at his face. </span>
<span sid='49165' title='49165'>It was pale and exultant, his eyes shining brightly in the moonlight. </span>
<span sid='49166' title='49166'>But suddenly they started forward in a rigid, fixed stare, and his lips parted in amazement. </span>
<span sid='49167' title='49167'>At the same instant Lestrade gave a yell of terror and threw himself face downwards upon the ground. </span>
<span sid='49168' title='49168'>I sprang to my feet, my inert hand grasping my pistol, my mind paralysed by the dreadful shape which had sprung out upon us from the shadows of the fog. </span>
<span sid='49169' title='49169'>A hound it was, an enormous coal-black hound, but not such a hound as mortal eyes have ever seen. </span>
<span sid='49170' title='49170'>Fire burst from its open mouth, its eyes glowed with a smouldering glare, its muzzle and hackles and dewlap were outlined in flickering flame. </span>
<span sid='49171' title='49171'>Never in the delirious dream of a disordered brain could anything more savage, more appalling, more hellish, be conceived than that dark form and savage face which broke upon us out of the wall of fog.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49172' title='49172'>With long bounds the huge black creature was leaping down the track, following hard upon the footsteps of our friend. </span>
<span sid='49173' title='49173'>So paralysed were we by the apparition that we allowed him to pass before we had recovered our nerve. </span>
<span sid='49174' title='49174'>Then Holmes and I both fired together, and the creature gave a hideous howl, which showed that one at least had hit him. </span>
<span sid='49175' title='49175'>He did not pause, however, but bounded onwards. </span>
<span sid='49176' title='49176'>Far away on the path we saw Sir Henry looking back, his face white in the moonlight, his hands raised in horror, glaring helplessly at the frightful thing which was hunting him down.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49177' title='49177'>But that cry of pain from the hound had blown all our fears to the winds. </span>
<span sid='49178' title='49178'>If he was vulnerable he was mortal, and if we could wound him we could kill him. </span>
<span sid='49179' title='49179'>Never have I seen a man run as Holmes ran that night. </span>
<span sid='49180' title='49180'>I am reckoned fleet of foot, but he outpaced me as much as I outpaced the little professional. </span>
<span sid='49181' title='49181'>In front of us as we flew up the track we heard scream after scream from Sir Henry and the deep roar of the hound. </span>
<span sid='49182' title='49182'>I was in time to see the beast spring upon its victim, hurl him to the ground and worry at his throat. </span>
<span sid='49183' title='49183'>But the next instant Holmes had emptied five barrels of his revolver into the creature's flank. </span>
<span sid='49184' title='49184'>With a last howl of agony and a vicious snap in the air it rolled upon its back, four feet pawing furiously, and then fell limp upon its side. </span>
<span sid='49185' title='49185'>I stooped, panting, and pressed my pistol to the dreadful, shimmering head, but it was useless to press the trigger. </span>
<span sid='49186' title='49186'>The giant hound was dead.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49187' title='49187'>Sir Henry lay insensible where he had fallen. </span>
<span sid='49188' title='49188'>We tore away his collar, and Holmes breathed a prayer of gratitude when we saw that there was no sign of a wound and that the rescue had been in time. </span>
<span sid='49189' title='49189'>Already our friend's eyelids shivered and he made a feeble effort to move. </span>
<span sid='49190' title='49190'>Lestrade thrust his brandy-flask between the Baronet's teeth, and two frightened eyes were looking up at us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49191' title='49191'>'My God!' he whispered. </span>
<span sid='49192' title='49192'>'What was it? </span>
<span sid='49193' title='49193'>What, in Heaven's name, was it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49194' title='49194'>'It's dead, whatever it is,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='49195' title='49195'>'We've laid the family ghost once and for ever.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49196' title='49196'>In mere size and strength it was a terrible creature which was lying stretched before us. </span>
<span sid='49197' title='49197'>It was not a pure bloodhound and it was not a pure mastiff, but it appeared to be a combination of the two - gaunt, savage, and as large as a small lioness. </span>
<span sid='49198' title='49198'>Even now, in the stillness of death, the huge jaws seemed to be dripping with a bluish flame, and the small, deep-set, cruel eyes were ringed with fire. </span>
<span sid='49199' title='49199'>I placed my hand upon the glowing muzzle, and as I held them up my own fingers smouldered and gleamed in the darkness.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49200' title='49200'>'Phosphorus,' I said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49201' title='49201'>'A cunning preparation of it,' said Holmes, sniffing at the dead animal. </span>
<span sid='49202' title='49202'>'There is no smell which might have interfered with his power of scent. </span>
<span sid='49203' title='49203'>We owe you a deep apology, Sir Henry, for having exposed you to this fright. </span>
<span sid='49204' title='49204'>I was prepared for a hound, but not for such a creature as this. </span>
<span sid='49205' title='49205'>And the fog gave us little time to receive him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49206' title='49206'>'You have saved my life.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49207' title='49207'>'Having first endangered it. </span>
<span sid='49208' title='49208'>Are you strong enough to stand?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49209' title='49209'>'Give me another mouthful of that brandy, and I shall be ready for anything. </span>
<span sid='49210' title='49210'>So! </span>
<span sid='49211' title='49211'>Now, if you will help me up. </span>
<span sid='49212' title='49212'>What do you propose to do?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49213' title='49213'>'To leave you here. </span>
<span sid='49214' title='49214'>You are not fit for further adventures to-night. </span>
<span sid='49215' title='49215'>If you will wait, one or other of us will go back with you to the Hall.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49216' title='49216'>He tried to stagger to his feet, but he was still ghastly pale and trembling in every limb. </span>
<span sid='49217' title='49217'>We helped him to a rock, where he sat shivering with his face buried in his hands.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49218' title='49218'>'We must leave you now,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='49219' title='49219'>'The rest of our work must be done, and every moment is of importance. </span>
<span sid='49220' title='49220'>We have our case, and now we only want our man.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49221' title='49221'>'It's a thousand to one against our finding him at the house,' he continued, as we retraced our steps swiftly down the path. </span>
<span sid='49222' title='49222'>'Those shots must have told him that the game was up.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49223' title='49223'>'We were some distance off, and this fog may have deadened them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49224' title='49224'>'He followed the hound to call him off - of that you may be certain. </span>
<span sid='49225' title='49225'>No, no, he's gone by this time! </span>
<span sid='49226' title='49226'>But we'll search the house and make sure.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49227' title='49227'>The front door was open, so we rushed in and hurried from room to room, to the amazement of a doddering old manservant, who met us in the passage. </span>
<span sid='49228' title='49228'>There was no light save in the dining-room, but Holmes caught up the lamp, and left no corner of the house unexplored. </span>
<span sid='49229' title='49229'>No sign could we see of the man whom we were chasing. </span>
<span sid='49230' title='49230'>On the upper floor, however, one of the bed-room doors was locked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49231' title='49231'>'There's someone in here!' cried Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='49232' title='49232'>'I can hear a movement. </span>
<span sid='49233' title='49233'>Open this door!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49234' title='49234'>A faint moaning and rustling came from within. </span>
<span sid='49235' title='49235'>Holmes struck the door just over the lock with the flat of his foot, and it flew open. </span>
<span sid='49236' title='49236'>Pistol in hand, we all three rushed into the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49237' title='49237'>But there was no sign within it of that desperate and defiant villain whom we expected to see. </span>
<span sid='49238' title='49238'>Instead we were faced by an object so strange and so unexpected that we stood for a moment staring at it in amazement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49239' title='49239'>The room had been fashioned into a small museum, and the walls were lined by a number of glass-topped cases full of that collection of butterflies and moths the formation of which had been the relaxation of this complex and dangerous man. </span>
<span sid='49240' title='49240'>In the centre of this room there was an upright beam, which had been placed at some period as a support for the old worm-eaten balk of timber which spanned the roof. </span>
<span sid='49241' title='49241'>To this post a figure was tied, so swathed and muffled in sheets which had been used to secure it that one could not for the moment tell whether it was that of a man or a woman. </span>
<span sid='49242' title='49242'>One towel passed round the throat, and was secured at the back of the pillar. </span>
<span sid='49243' title='49243'>Another covered the lower part of the face and over it two dark eyes - eyes full of grief and shame and a dreadful questioning - stared back at us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49244' title='49244'>In a minute we had torn off the gag, unswathed the bonds, and Mrs Stapleton sank upon the floor in front of us. </span>
<span sid='49245' title='49245'>As her beautiful head fell upon her chest I saw the clear red weal of a whiplash across her neck.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49246' title='49246'>'The brute!' cried Holmes. </span>
<span sid='49247' title='49247'>'Here, Lestrade, your brandy-bottle! </span>
<span sid='49248' title='49248'>Put her in the chair! </span>
<span sid='49249' title='49249'>She has fainted from ill-usage and exhaustion.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49250' title='49250'>She opened her eyes again. </span>
<span sid='49251' title='49251'>'Is he safe?' she asked. </span>
<span sid='49252' title='49252'>'Has he escaped?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49253' title='49253'>'He cannot escape us, madam.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49254' title='49254'>'No, no, I did not mean my husband. </span>
<span sid='49255' title='49255'>Sir Henry? </span>
<span sid='49256' title='49256'>Is he safe?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49257' title='49257'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49258' title='49258'>'And the hound?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49259' title='49259'>'It is dead.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49260' title='49260'>She gave a long sigh of satisfaction. </span>
<span sid='49261' title='49261'>'Thank God! </span>
<span sid='49262' title='49262'>Thank God! </span>
<span sid='49263' title='49263'>Oh, this villain! </span>
<span sid='49264' title='49264'>See how he has treated me!' </span>
<span sid='49265' title='49265'>She shot her arms out from her sleeves, and we saw with horror that they were all mottled with bruises. </span>
<span sid='49266' title='49266'>'But this is nothing-nothing! </span>
<span sid='49267' title='49267'>It is my mind and soul that he has tortured and defiled. </span>
<span sid='49268' title='49268'>I could endure it all, ill-usage, solitude, a life of deception, everything, as long as I could still cling to the hope that I had his love, but now I know that in this also I have been his dupe and his tool.' </span>
<span sid='49269' title='49269'>She broke into passionate sobbing as she spoke.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49270' title='49270'>'You bear him no good will, madam,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='49271' title='49271'>'Tell us, then, where we shall find him. </span>
<span sid='49272' title='49272'>If you have ever aided him in evil, help us now and so atone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49273' title='49273'>'There is but one place where he can have fled,' she answered. </span>
<span sid='49274' title='49274'>'There is an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the Mire. </span>
<span sid='49275' title='49275'>It was there that he kept his hound and there also he had made preparations so that he might have a refuge. </span>
<span sid='49276' title='49276'>That is where he would fly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49277' title='49277'>The fog-bank lay like white wool against the window. </span>
<span sid='49278' title='49278'>Holmes held the lamp towards it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49279' title='49279'>'See,' said he. </span>
<span sid='49280' title='49280'>'No one could find his way into the Grimpen Mire tonight.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49281' title='49281'>She laughed and clapped her hands. </span>
<span sid='49282' title='49282'>Her eyes and teeth gleamed with fierce merriment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49283' title='49283'>'He may find his way in, but never out,' she cried. </span>
<span sid='49284' title='49284'>'How can he see the guiding wands to-night? </span>
<span sid='49285' title='49285'>We planted them together, he and I, to mark the pathway through the Mire. </span>
<span sid='49286' title='49286'>Oh, if I could only have plucked them out to-day! </span>
<span sid='49287' title='49287'>Then indeed you would have had him at your mercy!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49288' title='49288'>It was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog had lifted. </span>
<span sid='49289' title='49289'>Meanwhile we left Lestrade in possession of the house, while Holmes and I went back with the baronet to Baskerville Hall. </span>
<span sid='49290' title='49290'>The story of the Stapletons could no longer be withheld from him, but he took the blow bravely when he learned the truth about the woman whom he had loved. </span>
<span sid='49291' title='49291'>But the shock of the night's adventures had shattered his nerves, and before morning he lay delirious in a high fever, under the care of Dr Mortimer. </span>
<span sid='49292' title='49292'>The two of them were destined to travel together round the world before Sir Henry had become once more the hale, hearty man that he had been before he became master of that ill-omened estate.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49293' title='49293'>And now I come rapidly to the conclusion of this singular narrative, in which I have tried to make the reader share those dark fears and vague surmises which clouded our lives so long, and ended in so tragic a manner. </span>
<span sid='49294' title='49294'>On the morning after the death of the hound the fog had lifted and we were guided by Mrs Stapleton to the point where they had found a pathway through the bog. </span>
<span sid='49295' title='49295'>It helped us to realize the horror of this woman's life when we saw the eagerness and joy with which she laid us on her husband's track. </span>
<span sid='49296' title='49296'>We left her standing upon the thin peninsula of firm, peaty soil which tapered out into the widespread bog. </span>
<span sid='49297' title='49297'>From the end of it a small wand planted here and there showed where the path zig-zagged from tuft to tuft of rushes among those green-scummed pits and foul quagmires which barred the way to the stranger. </span>
<span sid='49298' title='49298'>Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour of decay and a heavy miasmatic vapour into our faces, while a false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark, quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft undulations around our feet. </span>
<span sid='49299' title='49299'>Its tenacious grip plucked at our heels as we walked, and when we sank into it it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us down into those obscene depths, so grim and purposeful was the clutch in which it held us. </span>
<span sid='49300' title='49300'>Once only we saw a trace that someone had passed that perilous way before us. </span>
<span sid='49301' title='49301'>From amid a tuft of cotton-grass which bore it up out of the slime some dark thing was projecting. </span>
<span sid='49302' title='49302'>Holmes sank to his waist as he stepped from the path to seize it, and had we not been there to drag him out he could never have set his foot upon firm land again. </span>
<span sid='49303' title='49303'>He held an old black boot in the air. </span>
<span sid='49304' title='49304'>'Meyers, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Toronto&t=h'>Toronto</a>', was printed on the leather inside.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49305' title='49305'>'It is worth a mud bath,' said he. </span>
<span sid='49306' title='49306'>'It is our friend Sir Henry's missing boot.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49307' title='49307'>'Thrown there by Stapleton in his flight.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49308' title='49308'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='49309' title='49309'>He retained it in his hand after using it to set the hound upon his track. </span>
<span sid='49310' title='49310'>He fled when he knew the game was up, still clutching it. </span>
<span sid='49311' title='49311'>And he hurled it away at this point of his flight. </span>
<span sid='49312' title='49312'>We know at least that he came so far in safety.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49313' title='49313'>But more than that we were never destined to know, though there was much which we might surmise. </span>
<span sid='49314' title='49314'>There was no chance of finding footsteps in the mire, for the rising mud oozed swiftly in upon them, but as we at last reached firmer ground beyond the morass we all looked eagerly for them. </span>
<span sid='49315' title='49315'>But no slightest sign of them ever met our eyes. </span>
<span sid='49316' title='49316'>If the earth told a true story, then Stapleton never reached that island of refuge towards which he struggled through the fog upon that last night. </span>
<span sid='49317' title='49317'>Somewhere in the heart of the great Grimpen Mire, down in the foul slime of the huge morass which had sucked him in, this cold and cruel-hearted man is for ever buried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49318' title='49318'>Many traces we found of him in the bog-girt island where he had hid his savage ally. </span>
<span sid='49319' title='49319'>A huge driving-wheel and a shaft half-filled with rubbish showed the position of an abandoned mine. </span>
<span sid='49320' title='49320'>Beside it were the crumbling remains of the cottages of the miners, driven away, no doubt, by the foul reek of the surrounding swamp. </span>
<span sid='49321' title='49321'>In one of these a staple and chain, with a quantity of gnawed bones, showed where the animal had been confined. </span>
<span sid='49322' title='49322'>A skeleton with a tangle of' brown hair adhering to it lay among the dÃ©bris.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49323' title='49323'>'A dog!' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='49324' title='49324'>'By Jove, a curly-haired spaniel. </span>
<span sid='49325' title='49325'>Poor Mortimer will never see his pet again. </span>
<span sid='49326' title='49326'>Well, I do not know that this place contains any secret which we have not already fathomed. </span>
<span sid='49327' title='49327'>He could hide his hound, but he could not hush its voice, and hence came those cries which even in daylight were not pleasant to hear. </span>
<span sid='49328' title='49328'>On an emergency he could keep the hound in the outhouse at Merripit, but it was always a risk, and it was only on the supreme day, which he regarded as the end of all his efforts, that he dared do it. </span>
<span sid='49329' title='49329'>This paste in the tin is no doubt the luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed. </span>
<span sid='49330' title='49330'>It was suggested, of course, by the story of the family hell-hound, and by the desire to frighten old Sir Charles to death. </span>
<span sid='49331' title='49331'>No wonder the poor devil of a convict ran and screamed, even as our friend did, and as we ourselves might have done, when he saw such a creature bounding through the darkness of the moor upon his track. </span>
<span sid='49332' title='49332'>It was a cunning device, for, apart from the chance of driving your victim to his death, what peasant would venture to inquire too closely into such a creature should he get sight of it, as many have done, upon the moor? </span>
<span sid='49333' title='49333'>I said it in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, Watson, and I say it again now, that never yet have we helped to hunt down a more dangerous man than he who is lying yonder' - he swept his long arm towards the huge mottled expanse of green-splotched bog which stretched away until it merged into the russet slopes of the moor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49334' title='49334'>CHAPTER 15 : A Retrospection</span>
<p>
<span sid='49335' title='49335'>It was the end of November, and Holmes and I sat, upon a raw and foggy night, on either side of a blazing fire in our sitting-room in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='49336' title='49336'>Since the tragic upshot of our visit to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Devonshire&t=h'>Devonshire</a> he had been engaged in two affairs of the utmost importance, in the first of which he had exposed the atrocious conduct of Colonel Upwood in connection with the famous card scandal of the Nonpareil Club, while in the second he had defended the unfortunate Mme Montpensier from the charge of murder, which hung over her in connection with the death of her step-daughter, Mlle CarÃ¨re, the young lady who, as it will be remembered, was found six months later alive and married in New <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=York&t=h'>York</a>. </span>
<span sid='49337' title='49337'>My friend was in excellent spirits over the success which had attended a succession of difficult and important cases, so that I was able to induce him to discuss the details of the Baskerville mystery. </span>
<span sid='49338' title='49338'>I had waited patiently for the opportunity, for I was aware that he would never permit cases to overlap, and that his clear and logical mind would not be drawn from its present work to dwell upon memories of the past. </span>
<span sid='49339' title='49339'>Sir Henry and Dr Mortimer were, however, in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, on their way to that long voyage which had been recommended for the restoration of his shattered nerves. </span>
<span sid='49340' title='49340'>They had called upon us that very afternoon, so that it was natural that the subject should come up for discussion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49341' title='49341'>'The whole course of events,' said Holmes, 'from the point of view of the man who called himself Stapleton, was simple and direct, although to us, who had no means in the beginning of knowing the motives of his actions and could only learn part of the facts, it all appeared exceedingly complex. </span>
<span sid='49342' title='49342'>I have had the advantage of two conversations with Mrs Stapleton, and the case has now been so entirely cleared up that I am not aware that there is anything which has remained a secret to us. </span>
<span sid='49343' title='49343'>You will find a few notes upon the matter under the heading B in my indexed list of cases.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49344' title='49344'>'Perhaps you would kindly give me a sketch of the course of events from memory.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49345' title='49345'>'Certainly, though I cannot guarantee that I carry all the facts in my mind. </span>
<span sid='49346' title='49346'>Intense mental concentration has a curious way of blotting out what has passed. </span>
<span sid='49347' title='49347'>The barrister who has his case at his fingers' end, and is able to argue with an expert upon his own subject, finds that a week or two of the courts will drive it all out of his head once more. </span>
<span sid='49348' title='49348'>So each of my cases displaces the last, and Mlle CarÃ¨re has blurred my recollection of Baskerville Hall. </span>
<span sid='49349' title='49349'>To-morrow some other little problem may be submitted to my notice, which will in turn disposses the fair French lady and the infamous Upwood. </span>
<span sid='49350' title='49350'>So far as the case of the Hound goes, however, I will give you the course of events as nearly as I can, and you will suggest anything which I may have forgotten.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49351' title='49351'>'My inquiries show beyond all question that the family portrait did not lie, and that this fellow was indeed a Baskerville. </span>
<span sid='49352' title='49352'>He was a son of that Rodger Baskerville, the younger brother of Sir Charles, who fled with a sinister reputation to South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>, where he was said to have died unmarried. </span>
<span sid='49353' title='49353'>He did, as a matter of fact, marry, and had one child, this fellow, whose real name is the same as his father. </span>
<span sid='49354' title='49354'>He married Beryl Garcia, one of the beauties of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Costa Rica&t=h'>Costa Rica</a>, and, having purloined a considerable sum of public money, he changed his name to Vandeleur and fled to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, where he established a school in the east of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=York&t=h'>York</a>shire. </span>
<span sid='49355' title='49355'>His reason for attempting this special line of business was that he had struck up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon the voyage home, and that he had used this man's ability to make the undertaking a success. </span>
<span sid='49356' title='49356'>Fraser, the tutor, died, however, and the school which had begun well, sank from disrepute into infamy. </span>
<span sid='49357' title='49357'>The Vandeleurs found it convenient to change their name to Stapleton, and he brought the remains of his fortune, his schemes for the future, and his taste for entomology to the south of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>. </span>
<span sid='49358' title='49358'>I learn at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the British Museum&t=h'>the British Museum</a> that he was a recognized authority upon the subject, and that the name of Vandeleur has been permanently attached to a certain moth which he had, in his <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=York&t=h'>York</a>shire days, been the first to describe.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49359' title='49359'>'We now come to that portion of his life which has proved to be of such intense interest to us. </span>
<span sid='49360' title='49360'>The fellow had evidently made inquiry, and found that only two lives intervened between him and a valuable estate. </span>
<span sid='49361' title='49361'>When he went to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Devonshire&t=h'>Devonshire</a> his plans were, I believe, exceedingly hazy, but that he meant mischief from the first is evident from the way in which he took his wife with him in the character of his sister. </span>
<span sid='49362' title='49362'>The idea of using her as a decoy was clearly already in his mind, though he may not have been certain how the details of his plot were to be arranged. </span>
<span sid='49363' title='49363'>He meant in the end to have the estate, and he was ready to use any tool or run any risk for that end. </span>
<span sid='49364' title='49364'>His first act was to establish himself as near to his ancestral home as he could, and his second was to cultivate a friendship with Sir Charles Baskerville and with the neighbours.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49365' title='49365'>'The Baronet himself told him about the family hound, and so prepared the way for his own death. </span>
<span sid='49366' title='49366'>Stapleton, as I will continue to call him, knew that the old man's heart was weak and that a shock would kill him. </span>
<span sid='49367' title='49367'>So much he had learned from Dr Mortimer. </span>
<span sid='49368' title='49368'>He had heard also that Sir Charles was superstitious and had taken this grim legend very seriously. </span>
<span sid='49369' title='49369'>His ingenious mind instantly suggested a way by which the Baronet could be done to death, and yet it would be hardly possible to bring home the guilt to the real murderer.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49370' title='49370'>'Having conceived the idea, he proceeded to carry it out with considerable finesse. </span>
<span sid='49371' title='49371'>An ordinary schemer would have been content to work with a savage hound. </span>
<span sid='49372' title='49372'>The use of artificial means to make the creature diabolical was a flash of genius upon his part. </span>
<span sid='49373' title='49373'>The dog he bought in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Ross&t=h'>Ross</a> and Mangles the dealers in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Fulham Road&t=h'>Fulham Road</a>. </span>
<span sid='49374' title='49374'>It was the strongest and most savage in their possession. </span>
<span sid='49375' title='49375'>He brought it down by the North Devon line, and walked a great distance over the moor, so as to get it home without exciting any remarks. </span>
<span sid='49376' title='49376'>He had already on his insect hunts learned to penetrate the Grimpen Mire, and so had found a safe hiding-place for the creature. </span>
<span sid='49377' title='49377'>Here he kennelled it and waited his chance.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49378' title='49378'>'But it was some time coming. </span>
<span sid='49379' title='49379'>The old gentleman could not be decoyed outside of his grounds at night. </span>
<span sid='49380' title='49380'>Several times Stapleton lurked about with his hound, but without avail. </span>
<span sid='49381' title='49381'>It was during these fruitless quests that he, or rather his ally, was seen by peasants, and that the legend of the demon dog received a new confirmation. </span>
<span sid='49382' title='49382'>He had hoped that his wife might lure Sir Charles to his ruin, but here she proved unexpectedly independent. </span>
<span sid='49383' title='49383'>She would not endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in a sentimental attachment which might deliver him over to his enemy. </span>
<span sid='49384' title='49384'>Threats and even, I am sorry to say, blows failed to move her. </span>
<span sid='49385' title='49385'>She would have nothing to do with it, and for a time Stapleton was at a deadlock.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49386' title='49386'>'He found a way out of his difficulties through the chance that Sir Charles, who had conceived a friendship with him, made him the minister of his charity in the case of this unfortunate woman, Mrs Laura <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lyons&t=h'>Lyons</a>. </span>
<span sid='49387' title='49387'>By representing himself as a single man, he acquired complete influence over her, and he gave her to understand that in the event of her obtaining a divorce from her husband he would marry her. </span>
<span sid='49388' title='49388'>His plans were suddenly brought to a head by his knowledge that Sir Charles was about to leave the Hall on the advice of Dr Mortimer, with whose opinion he himself pretended to coincide. </span>
<span sid='49389' title='49389'>He must act at once, or his victim might get beyond his power. </span>
<span sid='49390' title='49390'>He therefore put pressure upon Mrs <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lyons&t=h'>Lyons</a> to write this letter, imploring the old man to give her an interview on the evening before his departure for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='49391' title='49391'>He then, by a specious argument, prevented her from going, and so had the chance for which he had waited.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49392' title='49392'>'Driving back in the evening from Coombe Tracey, he was in time to get his hound, to treat it with his infernal paint, and to bring the beast round to the gate at which he had reason to expect that he would find the old gentleman waiting. </span>
<span sid='49393' title='49393'>The dog, incited by its master, sprang over the wicket-gate and pursued the unfortunate Baronet, who fled screaming down the Yew Alley. </span>
<span sid='49394' title='49394'>In that gloomy tunnel it must indeed have been a dreadful sight to see that huge black creature, with its flaming jaws and blazing eyes, bounding after its victim. </span>
<span sid='49395' title='49395'>He fell dead at the end of the alley from heart disease and terror. </span>
<span sid='49396' title='49396'>The hound had kept upon the grassy border while the baronet had run down the path, so that no track but the man's was visible. </span>
<span sid='49397' title='49397'>On seeing him lying still the creature had probably approached to sniff at him, but, finding him dead, had turned away again. </span>
<span sid='49398' title='49398'>It was then that it left the print which was actually observed by Dr Mortimer. </span>
<span sid='49399' title='49399'>The hound was called off and hurried away to its lair in the Grimpen Mire, and a mystery was left which puzzled the authorities, alarmed the country-side, and finally brought the case within the scope of our observation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49400' title='49400'>'So much for the death of Sir Charles Baskerville. </span>
<span sid='49401' title='49401'>You perceive the devilish cunning of it, for really it would be almost impossible to make a case against the real murderer. </span>
<span sid='49402' title='49402'>His only accomplice was one who could never give him away, and the grotesque, inconceivable nature of the device only served to make it more effective. </span>
<span sid='49403' title='49403'>Both of the women concerned in the case, Mrs Stapleton and Mrs Laura <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lyons&t=h'>Lyons</a>, were left with a strong suspicion against Stapleton. </span>
<span sid='49404' title='49404'>Mrs Stapleton knew that he had designs upon the old man, and also of the existence of the hound. </span>
<span sid='49405' title='49405'>Mrs <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lyons&t=h'>Lyons</a> knew neither of these things, but had been impressed by the death occurring at the time of an uncancelled appointment which was only known to him. </span>
<span sid='49406' title='49406'>However, both of them were under his influence, and he had nothing to fear from them. </span>
<span sid='49407' title='49407'>The first half of his task was successfully accomplished, but the more difficult still remained.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49408' title='49408'>'It is possible that Stapleton did not know of the existence of an heir in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Canada&t=h'>Canada</a>. </span>
<span sid='49409' title='49409'>In any case he would very soon learn it from his friend Dr Mortimer, and he was told by the latter all details about the arrival of Henry Baskerville. </span>
<span sid='49410' title='49410'>Stapleton's first idea was that this young stranger from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Canada&t=h'>Canada</a> might possibly be done to death in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> without coming down to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Devonshire&t=h'>Devonshire</a> at all. </span>
<span sid='49411' title='49411'>He distrusted his wife ever since she had refused to help him in laying a trap for the old man, and he dared not leave her long out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence over her. </span>
<span sid='49412' title='49412'>It was for this reason that he took her to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> with him. </span>
<span sid='49413' title='49413'>They lodged, I find, at the Mexborough Private Hotel, in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Craven Street&t=h'>Craven Street</a>, which was actually one of those called upon by my agent in search of evidence. </span>
<span sid='49414' title='49414'>Here he kept his wife imprisoned in her room while he, disguised in a beard, followed Dr Mortimer to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>, and afterwards to the station and to the Northumberland Hotel. </span>
<span sid='49415' title='49415'>His wife had some inkling of his plans, but she had such a fear of her husband - a fear founded upon brutal ill-treatment - that she dare not write to warn the man whom she knew to be in danger. </span>
<span sid='49416' title='49416'>If the letter should fall into Stapleton's hands her own life would not be safe. </span>
<span sid='49417' title='49417'>Eventually, as we know, she adopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would form the message, and addressing the letter in a disguised hand. </span>
<span sid='49418' title='49418'>It reached the Baronet, and gave him the first warning of his danger.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49419' title='49419'>'It was very essential for Stapleton to get some article of Sir Henry's attire, so that, in case he was driven to use the dog, he might always have the means of setting him upon his track. </span>
<span sid='49420' title='49420'>With characteristic promptness and audacity he set about this at once, and we cannot doubt that the boots or chambermaid of the hotel was well bribed to help him in his design. </span>
<span sid='49421' title='49421'>By chance, however, the first boot which was procured for him was a new one, and, therefore, useless for his purpose. </span>
<span sid='49422' title='49422'>He then had it returned and obtained another - a most instructive incident, since it proved conclusively to my mind that we were dealing with a real hound, as no other supposition could explain this anxiety to obtain an old boot and this indifference to a new one. </span>
<span sid='49423' title='49423'>The more outrÃ© and grotesque an incident is the more carefully it deserves to be examined, and the very point which appears to complicate a case is, when duly considered and scientifically handled, the one which is most likely to elucidate it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49424' title='49424'>'Then we had the visit from our friends next morning, shadowed always by Stapleton in the cab. </span>
<span sid='49425' title='49425'>From his knowledge of our rooms and of my appearance, as well as from his general conduct, I am inclined to think that Stapleton's career of crime has been by no means limited to this single Baskerville affair. </span>
<span sid='49426' title='49426'>It is suggestive that during the last three years there have been four considerable burglaries in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the West&t=h'>the West</a> Country, for none of which was any criminal ever arrested. </span>
<span sid='49427' title='49427'>The last of these, at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Folkestone Court&t=h'>Folkestone Court</a>, in May, was remarkable for the cold-blooded pistolling of the page, who surprised the masked and solitary burglar. </span>
<span sid='49428' title='49428'>I cannot doubt that Stapleton recruited his waning resources in this fashion, and that for years he has been a desperate and dangerous man.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49429' title='49429'>'We had an example of his readiness of resource that morning when he got away from us so successfully, and also of his audacity in sending back my own name to me through the cabman. </span>
<span sid='49430' title='49430'>From that moment he understood that I had taken over the case in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, and that therefore there was no chance for him there. </span>
<span sid='49431' title='49431'>He returned to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Dartmoor&t=h'>Dartmoor</a> and awaited the arrival of the Baronet.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49432' title='49432'>'One moment!' said I. </span>
<span sid='49433' title='49433'>'You have, no doubt, described the sequence of events correctly, but there is one point which you have left unexplained. </span>
<span sid='49434' title='49434'>What became of the hound when its master was in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49435' title='49435'>'I have given some attention to this matter, and it is undoubtedly of importance. </span>
<span sid='49436' title='49436'>There can be no question that Stapleton had a confidant, though it is unlikely that he ever placed himself in his power by sharing all his plans with him. </span>
<span sid='49437' title='49437'>There was an old manservant at Merripit House, whose name was Anthony. </span>
<span sid='49438' title='49438'>His connection with the Stapletons can be traced for several years, as far back as the school-mastering days, so that he must have been aware that his master and mistress were really husband and wife. </span>
<span sid='49439' title='49439'>This man has disappeared and has escaped from the country. </span>
<span sid='49440' title='49440'>It is suggestive that Anthony is not a common name in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, while Antonio is so in all Spanish or Spanish-<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n countries. </span>
<span sid='49441' title='49441'>The man, like Mrs Stapleton herself, spoke good English, but with a curious lisping accent. </span>
<span sid='49442' title='49442'>I have myself seen this old man cross the Grimpen Mire by the path which Stapleton had marked out. </span>
<span sid='49443' title='49443'>It is very probable, therefore, that in the absence of his master it was he who cared for the hound, though he may never have known the purpose for which the beast was used.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49444' title='49444'>'The Stapletons then went down to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Devonshire&t=h'>Devonshire</a>, whither they were soon followed by Sir Henry and you. </span>
<span sid='49445' title='49445'>One word now as to how I stood myself at that time. </span>
<span sid='49446' title='49446'>It may possibly recur to your memory that when I examined the paper upon which the printed words were fastened I made a close inspection for the water-mark. </span>
<span sid='49447' title='49447'>In doing so I held it within a few inches of my eyes, and was conscious of a faint smell of the scent known as white jessamine. </span>
<span sid='49448' title='49448'>There are seventy-five perfumes, which it is very necessary that the criminal expert should be able to distinguish from each other, and cases have more than once within my own experience depended upon their prompt recognition. </span>
<span sid='49449' title='49449'>The scent suggested the presence of a lady, and already my thoughts began to turn towards the Stapletons. </span>
<span sid='49450' title='49450'>Thus I had made certain of the hound, and had guessed at the criminal before ever we went to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the West&t=h'>the West</a> Country.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49451' title='49451'>'It was my game to watch Stapleton. </span>
<span sid='49452' title='49452'>It was evident, however, that I could not do this if I were with you, since he would be keenly on his guard. </span>
<span sid='49453' title='49453'>I deceived everybody, therefore, yourself included, and I came down secretly when I was supposed to be in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='49454' title='49454'>My hardships were not so great as you imagine, though such trifling details must never interfere with the investigation of a case. </span>
<span sid='49455' title='49455'>I stayed for the most part at Coombe Tracey, and only used the hut upon the moor when it was necessary to be near the scene of action. </span>
<span sid='49456' title='49456'>Cartwright had come down with me, and in his disguise as a country boy he was of great assistance to me. </span>
<span sid='49457' title='49457'>I was dependent upon him for food and clean linen. </span>
<span sid='49458' title='49458'>When I was watching Stapleton, Cartwright was frequently watching you, so that I was able to keep my hand upon all the strings.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49459' title='49459'>'I have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly, being forwarded instantly from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> to Coombe Tracey. </span>
<span sid='49460' title='49460'>They were of great service to me, and especially that one incidentally truthful piece of biography of Stapleton's. </span>
<span sid='49461' title='49461'>I was able to establish the identity of the man and the woman, and knew at last exactly how I stood. </span>
<span sid='49462' title='49462'>The case had been considerably complicated through the incident of the escaped convict and the relations between him and the Barrymores. </span>
<span sid='49463' title='49463'>This also you cleared up in a very effective way, though I had already come to the same conclusions from my own observations.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49464' title='49464'>'By the time that you discovered me upon the moor I had a complete knowledge of the whole business, but I had not a case which could go to a jury. </span>
<span sid='49465' title='49465'>Even Stapleton's attempt upon Sir Henry that night, which ended in the death of the unfortunate convict, did not help us much in proving murder against our man. </span>
<span sid='49466' title='49466'>There seemed to be no alternative but to catch him red-handed, and to do so we had to use Sir Henry, alone and apparently unprotected, as a bait. </span>
<span sid='49467' title='49467'>We did so, and at the cost of a severe shock to our client we succeeded in completing our case and driving Stapleton to his destruction. </span>
<span sid='49468' title='49468'>That Sir Henry should have been exposed to this is, I must confess, a reproach to my management of the case, but we had no means of foreseeing the terrible and paralysing spectacle which the beast presented, nor could we predict the fog which enabled him to burst upon us at short notice. </span>
<span sid='49469' title='49469'>We succeeded in our object at a cost which both the specialist and Dr Mortimer assure me will be a temporary one. </span>
<span sid='49470' title='49470'>A long journey may enable our friend to recover not only from his shattered nerves but also from his wounded feelings. </span>
<span sid='49471' title='49471'>His love for the lady was deep and sincere, and to him the saddest part of all this black business was that he should have been deceived by her.</span>
<p>
<span sid='49472' title='49472'>'It only remains now to indicate the part which she had played throughout. </span>
<span sid='49473' title='49473'>There can be no doubt that Stapleton exercised an influence over her which may have been love or may have been fear, or very possibly both, since they are by no means incompatible emotions. </span>
<span sid='49474' title='49474'>It was, at least, absolutely effective. </span>
<span sid='49475' title='49475'>At his command she consented to pass as his sister, though he found the limits of his power over her when he endeavoured to make her the direct accessory to murder. </span>
<span sid='49476' title='49476'>She was ready to warn Sir Henry so far as she could without implicating her husband, and again and again she tried to do so. </span>
<span sid='49477' title='49477'>Stapleton himself seems to have been capable of jealousy, and when he saw the baronet paying court to the lady, even though it was part of his own plan, still he could not help interrupting with a passionate outburst which revealed the fiery soul which his self-contained manner so cleverly concealed. </span>
<span sid='49478' title='49478'>By encouraging the intimacy he made it certain that Sir Henry would frequently come to Merripit House, and that he would sooner or later get the opportunity which he desired. </span>
<span sid='49479' title='49479'>On the day of the crisis, however, his wife turned suddenly against him. </span>
<span sid='49480' title='49480'>She had learned something of the death of the convict, and she knew that the hound was being kept in the out-house on the evening that Sir Henry was coming to dinner. </span>
<span sid='49481' title='49481'>She taxed her husband with his intended crime and a furious scene followed, in which he showed her for the first time that she had a rival in his love. </span>
<span sid='49482' title='49482'>Her fidelity turned in an instant to bitter hatred, and he saw that she would betray him. </span>
<span sid='49483' title='49483'>He tied her up, therefore, that she might have no chance of warning Sir Henry, and he hoped, no doubt, that when the whole country-side put down the baronet's death to the curse of his family, as they certainly would do, he could win his wife back to accept an accomplished fact, and to keep silent upon what she knew. </span>
<span sid='49484' title='49484'>In this I fancy that in any case he made a miscalculation, and that, if we had not been there, his doom would none the less have been sealed. </span>
<span sid='49485' title='49485'>A woman of Spanish blood does not condone such an injury so lightly. </span>
<span sid='49486' title='49486'>And now, my dear Watson, without referring to my notes, I cannot give you a more detailed account of this curious case. </span>
<span sid='49487' title='49487'>I do not know that anything essential has been left unexplained.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49488' title='49488'>'He could not hope to frighten Sir Henry to death, as he had done the old uncle, with his bogie hound.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49489' title='49489'>'The beast was savage and half-starved. </span>
<span sid='49490' title='49490'>If its appearance did not frighten its victim to death, at least it would paralyse the resistance which might be offered.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49491' title='49491'>'No doubt. </span>
<span sid='49492' title='49492'>There only remains one difficulty. </span>
<span sid='49493' title='49493'>If Stapleton came into the succession, how could he explain the fact that he, the heir, had been living unannounced under another name so close to the property? </span>
<span sid='49494' title='49494'>How could he claim it without causing suspicion and inquiry?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='49495' title='49495'>'It is a formidable difficulty, and I fear that you ask too much when you expect me to solve it. </span>
<span sid='49496' title='49496'>The past and the present are within the field of my inquiry, but what a man may do in the future is a hard question to answer. </span>
<span sid='49497' title='49497'>Mrs Stapleton has heard her husband discuss the problem on several occasions. </span>
<span sid='49498' title='49498'>There were three possible courses. </span>
<span sid='49499' title='49499'>He might claim the property from South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>, establish his identity before the British authorities there, and so obtain the fortune without ever coming to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> at all, or he might adopt an elaborate disguise during the short time that he need be in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, or, again, he might furnish an accomplice with the proofs and papers, putting him in as heir, and retaining a claim upon some proportion of his income. </span>
<span sid='49500' title='49500'>We cannot doubt, from what we know of him, that he would have found some way out of the difficulty. </span>
<span sid='49501' title='49501'>And now, my dear Watson, we have had some weeks of severe work, and for one evening, I think, we may turn our thoughts into more pleasant channels. </span>
<span sid='49502' title='49502'>I have a box for Les Huguenots. </span>
<span sid='49503' title='49503'>Have you heard the De Reszkes? </span>
<span sid='49504' title='49504'>Might I trouble you then to be ready in half an hour, and we can stop at Marcini's for a little dinner on the way?'</span>
