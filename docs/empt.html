<p>
<span sid='43994' title='43994'>It was in the spring of the year 1894 that all <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> was interested, and the fashionable world dismayed, by the murder of the Honourable Ronald Adair, under most unusual and inexplicable circumstances. </span>
<span sid='43995' title='43995'>The public has already learned those particulars of the crime which came out in the police investigation; but a good deal was suppressed upon that occasion, since the case for the prosecution was so overwhelmingly strong that it was not necessary to bring forward all the facts. </span>
<span sid='43996' title='43996'>Only now, at the end of nearly ten years, am I allowed to supply those missing links which make up the whole of that remarkable chain. </span>
<span sid='43997' title='43997'>The crime was of interest in itself, but that interest was as nothing to me compared to the inconceivable sequel, which afforded me the greatest shock and surprise of any event in my adventurous life. </span>
<span sid='43998' title='43998'>Even now, after this long interval, I find myself thrilling as I think of it, and feeling once more that sudden flood of joy, amazement, and incredulity which utterly submerged my mind. </span>
<span sid='43999' title='43999'>Let me say to that public which has shown some interest in those glimpses which I have occasionally given them of the thoughts and actions of a very remarkable man that they are not to blame me if I have not shared my knowledge with them, for I should have considered it my first duty to have done so had I not been barred by a positive prohibition from his own lips, which was only withdrawn upon the third of last month.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44000' title='44000'>It can be imagined that my close intimacy with Sherlock Holmes had interested me deeply in crime, and that after his disappearance I never failed to read with care the various problems which came before the public, and I even attempted more than once for my own private satisfaction to employ his methods in their solution, though with indifferent success. </span>
<span sid='44001' title='44001'>There was none, however, which appealed to me like this tragedy of Ronald Adair. </span>
<span sid='44002' title='44002'>As I read the evidence at the inquest, which led up to a verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown, I realized more clearly than I had ever done the loss which the community had sustained by the death of Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='44003' title='44003'>There were points about this strange business which would, I was sure, have specially appealed to him, and the efforts of the police would have been supplemented, or more probably anticipated, by the trained observation and the alert mind of the first criminal agent in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>. </span>
<span sid='44004' title='44004'>All day as I drove upon my round I turned over the case in my mind, and found no explanation which appeared to me to be adequate. </span>
<span sid='44005' title='44005'>At the risk of telling a twice-told tale I will recapitulate the facts as they were known to the public at the conclusion of the inquest.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44006' title='44006'>The Honourable Ronald Adair was the second son of the Earl of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Maynooth&t=h'>Maynooth</a>, at that time Governor of one of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Australia&t=h'>Australia</a>n colonies. </span>
<span sid='44007' title='44007'>Adair's mother had returned from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Australia&t=h'>Australia</a> to undergo an operation for cataract, and she, her son Ronald, and her daughter Hilda were living together at 427 <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Park Lane&t=h'>Park Lane</a>. </span>
<span sid='44008' title='44008'>The youth moved in the best society, had, so far as was known, no enemies, and no particular vices. </span>
<span sid='44009' title='44009'>He had been engaged to Miss Edith Woodley, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Carstairs&t=h'>Carstairs</a>, but the engagement had been broken off by mutual consent some months before, and there was no sign that it had left any very profound feeling behind it. </span>
<span sid='44010' title='44010'>For the rest, the man's life moved in a narrow and conventional circle, for his habits were quiet and his nature unemotional. </span>
<span sid='44011' title='44011'>Yet it was upon this easy-going young aristocrat that death came in most strange and unexpected form between the hours of ten and eleven twenty on the night of March 30, 1894.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44012' title='44012'>Ronald Adair was fond of cards, playing continually, but never for such stakes as would hurt him. </span>
<span sid='44013' title='44013'>He was a member of the Baldwin, the Cavendish, and the Bagatelle Card Clubs. </span>
<span sid='44014' title='44014'>It was shown that after dinner on the day of his death he had played a rubber of whist at the latter club. </span>
<span sid='44015' title='44015'>He had also played there in the afternoon. </span>
<span sid='44016' title='44016'>The evidence of those who had played with him - Mr. Murray, Sir John Hardy, and Colonel Moran - showed that the game was whist, and that there was a fairly equal fall of the cards. </span>
<span sid='44017' title='44017'>Adair might have lost five pounds, but not more. </span>
<span sid='44018' title='44018'>His fortune was a considerable one, and such a loss could not in any way affect him. </span>
<span sid='44019' title='44019'>He had played nearly every day at one club or other, but he was a cautious player, and usually rose a winner. </span>
<span sid='44020' title='44020'>It came out in evidence that in partnership with Colonel Moran he had actually won as much as £420 in a sitting some weeks before from Godfrey Milner and Lord <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Balmoral&t=h'>Balmoral</a>. </span>
<span sid='44021' title='44021'>So much for his recent history, as it came out at the inquest.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44022' title='44022'>On the evening of the crime he returned from the club exactly at ten. </span>
<span sid='44023' title='44023'>His mother and sister were out spending the evening with a relation. </span>
<span sid='44024' title='44024'>The servant deposed that she heard him enter the front room on the second floor, generally used as his sitting-room. </span>
<span sid='44025' title='44025'>She had lit a fire there, and as it smoked she had opened the window. </span>
<span sid='44026' title='44026'>No sound was heard from the room until eleven-twenty, the hour of the return of Lady <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Maynooth&t=h'>Maynooth</a> and her daughter. </span>
<span sid='44027' title='44027'>Desiring to say good night, she had attempted to enter her son's room. </span>
<span sid='44028' title='44028'>The door was locked on the inside, and no answer could be got to their cries and knocking. </span>
<span sid='44029' title='44029'>Help was obtained, and the door forced. </span>
<span sid='44030' title='44030'>The unfortunate young man was found lying near the table. </span>
<span sid='44031' title='44031'>His head had been horribly mutilated by an expanded revolver bullet, but no weapon of any sort was to be found in the room. </span>
<span sid='44032' title='44032'>On the table lay two bank-notes for £10 each and £17 10s. </span>
<span sid='44033' title='44033'>in silver and gold, the money arranged in little piles of varying amount. </span>
<span sid='44034' title='44034'>There were some figures also upon a sheet of paper with the names of some club friends opposite to them, from which it was conjectured that before his death he was endeavouring to make out his losses or winnings at cards.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44035' title='44035'>A minute examination of the circumstances served only to make the case more complex. </span>
<span sid='44036' title='44036'>In the first place, no reason could be given why the young man should have fastened the door upon the inside. </span>
<span sid='44037' title='44037'>There was the possibility that the murderer had done this and had afterwards escaped by the window. </span>
<span sid='44038' title='44038'>The drop was at least twenty feet, however, and a bed of crocuses in full bloom lay beneath. </span>
<span sid='44039' title='44039'>Neither the flowers nor the earth showed any sign of having been disturbed, nor were there any marks upon the narrow strip of grass which separated the house from the road. </span>
<span sid='44040' title='44040'>Apparently, therefore, it was the young man himself who had fastened the door. </span>
<span sid='44041' title='44041'>But how did he come by his death? </span>
<span sid='44042' title='44042'>No one could have climbed up to the window without leaving traces. </span>
<span sid='44043' title='44043'>Suppose a man had fired through the window, it would indeed be a remarkable shot who could with a revolver inflict so deadly a wound. </span>
<span sid='44044' title='44044'>Again, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Park Lane&t=h'>Park Lane</a> is a frequented thoroughfare, and there is a cab-stand within a hundred yards of the house. </span>
<span sid='44045' title='44045'>No one had heard a shot. </span>
<span sid='44046' title='44046'>And yet there was the dead man, and there the revolver bullet, which had mushroomed out, as soft-nosed bullets will, and so inflicted a wound which must have caused instantaneous death. </span>
<span sid='44047' title='44047'>Such were the circumstances of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Park Lane&t=h'>Park Lane</a> Mystery, which were further complicated by entire absence of motive, since, as I have said, young Adair was not known to have any enemy, and no attempt had been made to remove the money or valuables in the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44048' title='44048'>All day I turned these facts over in my mind, endeavouring to hit upon some theory which could reconcile them all, and to find that line of least resistance which my poor friend had declared to be the starting-point of every investigation. </span>
<span sid='44049' title='44049'>I confess that I made little progress. </span>
<span sid='44050' title='44050'>In the evening I strolled across the Park, and found myself about six o'clock at the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Oxford Street&t=h'>Oxford Street</a> end of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Park Lane&t=h'>Park Lane</a>. </span>
<span sid='44051' title='44051'>A group of loafers upon the pavements, all staring up at a particular window, directed me to the house which I had come to see. </span>
<span sid='44052' title='44052'>A tall, thin man with coloured glasses, whom I strongly suspected of being a plain-clothes detective, was pointing out some theory of his own, while the others crowded round to listen to what he said. </span>
<span sid='44053' title='44053'>I got as near as I could, but his observations seemed to me to be absurd, so I withdrew again in some disgust. </span>
<span sid='44054' title='44054'>As I did so I struck against an elderly deformed man, who had been behind me, and I knocked down several books which he was carrying. </span>
<span sid='44055' title='44055'>I remember that as I picked them up I observed the title of one of them, The Origin of Tree Worship, and it struck me that the fellow must be some poor bibliophile who, either as a trade or as a hobby, was a collector of obscure volumes. </span>
<span sid='44056' title='44056'>I endeavoured to apologize for the accident, but it was evident that these books which I had so unfortunately maltreated were very precious objects in the eyes of their owner. </span>
<span sid='44057' title='44057'>With a snarl of contempt he turned upon his heel, and I saw his curved back and white side-whiskers disappear among the throng.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44058' title='44058'>My observations of No. 427 <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Park Lane&t=h'>Park Lane</a> did little to clear up the problem in which I was interested. </span>
<span sid='44059' title='44059'>The house was separated from the street by a low wall and railing, the whole not more than five feet high. </span>
<span sid='44060' title='44060'>It was perfectly easy, therefore, for anyone to get into the garden; but the window was entirely inaccessible, since there was no water-pipe or anything which could help the most active man to climb it. </span>
<span sid='44061' title='44061'>More puzzled than ever, I retraced my steps to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kensington&t=h'>Kensington</a>. </span>
<span sid='44062' title='44062'>I had not been in my study five minutes when the maid entered to say that a person desired to see me. </span>
<span sid='44063' title='44063'>To my astonishment, it was none other than my strange old book-collector, his sharp, wizened face peering out from a frame of white hair, and his precious volumes, a dozen of them at least, wedged under his right arm.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44064' title='44064'>'You're surprised to see me, sir,' said he, in a strange, croaking voice.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44065' title='44065'>I acknowledged that I was.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44066' title='44066'>'Well, I've a conscience, sir, and when I chanced to see you go into this house, as I came hobbling after you, I thought to myself, I'll just step in and see that kind gentleman, and tell him that if I was a bit gruff in my manner there was not any harm meant, and that I am much obliged to him for picking up my books.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44067' title='44067'>'You make too much of a trifle,' said I. </span>
<span sid='44068' title='44068'>'May I ask how you knew who I was?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44069' title='44069'>'Well, sir, if it isn't too great a liberty, I am a neighbour of yours, for you'll find my little bookshop at the corner of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Church Street&t=h'>Church Street</a>, and very happy to see you, I am sure. </span>
<span sid='44070' title='44070'>Maybe you collect yourself, sir; here's British Birds, and Catullus, and The Holy War - a bargain every one of them. </span>
<span sid='44071' title='44071'>With five volumes you could just fill that gap on that second shelf. </span>
<span sid='44072' title='44072'>It looks untidy, does it not, sir?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44073' title='44073'>I moved my head to look at the cabinet behind me. </span>
<span sid='44074' title='44074'>When I turned again Sherlock Holmes was standing smiling at me across my study table. </span>
<span sid='44075' title='44075'>I rose to my feet, stared at him for some seconds in utter amazement, and then it appears that I must have fainted for the first and the last time in my life. </span>
<span sid='44076' title='44076'>Certainly a grey mist swirled before my eyes, and when it cleared I found my collar-ends undone and the tingling after-taste of brandy upon my lips. </span>
<span sid='44077' title='44077'>Holmes was bending over my chair, his flask in his hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44078' title='44078'>'My dear Watson,' said the well-remembered voice, 'I owe you a thousand apologies. </span>
<span sid='44079' title='44079'>I had no idea that you would be so affected.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44080' title='44080'>I gripped him by the arm.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44081' title='44081'>'Holmes!' I cried. </span>
<span sid='44082' title='44082'>'Is it really you? </span>
<span sid='44083' title='44083'>Can it indeed be that you are alive? </span>
<span sid='44084' title='44084'>Is it possible that you succeeded in climbing out of that awful abyss?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44085' title='44085'>'Wait a moment!' said he. </span>
<span sid='44086' title='44086'>'Are you sure that you are really fit to discuss things? </span>
<span sid='44087' title='44087'>I have given you a serious shock by my unnecessarily dramatic appearance.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44088' title='44088'>'I am all right, but indeed, Holmes, I can hardly believe my eyes. </span>
<span sid='44089' title='44089'>Good heavens, to think that you-you of all men - should be standing in my study!' </span>
<span sid='44090' title='44090'>Again I gripped him by the sleeve and felt the thin, sinewy arm beneath it. </span>
<span sid='44091' title='44091'>'Well, you're not a spirit, anyhow,' said I. </span>
<span sid='44092' title='44092'>'My dear chap, I am overjoyed to see you. </span>
<span sid='44093' title='44093'>Sit down, and tell me how you came alive out of that dreadful chasm.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44094' title='44094'>He sat opposite to me and lit a cigarette in his old nonchalant manner. </span>
<span sid='44095' title='44095'>He was dressed in the seedy frock-coat of the book merchant, but the rest of that individual lay in a pile of white hair and old books upon the table. </span>
<span sid='44096' title='44096'>Holmes looked even thinner and keener than of old, but there was a dead-white tinge in his aquiline face which told me that his life recently had not been a healthy one.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44097' title='44097'>'I am glad to stretch myself, Watson,' said he. </span>
<span sid='44098' title='44098'>'It is no joke when a tall man has to take a foot off his stature for several hours on end. </span>
<span sid='44099' title='44099'>Now, my dear fellow, in the matter of these explanations we have, if I may ask for your co-operation, a hard and dangerous night's work in front of us. </span>
<span sid='44100' title='44100'>Perhaps it would be better if I gave you an account of the whole situation when that work is finished.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44101' title='44101'>'I am full of curiosity. </span>
<span sid='44102' title='44102'>I should much prefer to hear now.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44103' title='44103'>'You'll come with me to-night?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44104' title='44104'>'When you like and where you like.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44105' title='44105'>'This is indeed like the old days. </span>
<span sid='44106' title='44106'>We shall have time for a mouthful of dinner before we need go. </span>
<span sid='44107' title='44107'>Well, then, about that chasm. </span>
<span sid='44108' title='44108'>I had no serious difficulty in getting out of it, for the very simple reason that I never was in it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44109' title='44109'>'You never were in it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44110' title='44110'>'No, Watson, I never was in it. </span>
<span sid='44111' title='44111'>My note to you was absolutely genuine. </span>
<span sid='44112' title='44112'>I had little doubt that I had come to the end of my career when I perceived the somewhat sinister figure of the late Professor Moriarty standing upon the narrow pathway which led to safety. </span>
<span sid='44113' title='44113'>I read an inexorable purpose in his grey eyes. </span>
<span sid='44114' title='44114'>I exchanged some remarks with him, therefore, and obtained his courteous permission to write the short note which you afterwards received. </span>
<span sid='44115' title='44115'>I left it with my cigarette-box and my stick, and I walked along the pathway, Moriarty still at my heels. </span>
<span sid='44116' title='44116'>When I reached the end I stood at bay. </span>
<span sid='44117' title='44117'>He drew no weapon, but he rushed at me and threw his long arms around me. </span>
<span sid='44118' title='44118'>He knew that his own game was up, and was only anxious to revenge himself upon me. </span>
<span sid='44119' title='44119'>We tottered together upon the brink of the fall. </span>
<span sid='44120' title='44120'>I have some knowledge, however, of baritsu, or the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Japan&t=h'>Japan</a>ese system of wrestling, which has more than once been very useful to me. </span>
<span sid='44121' title='44121'>I slipped through his grip, and he with a horrible scream kicked madly for a few seconds and clawed the air with both his hands. </span>
<span sid='44122' title='44122'>But for all his efforts he could not get his balance, and over he went. </span>
<span sid='44123' title='44123'>With my face over the brink I saw him fall for a long way. </span>
<span sid='44124' title='44124'>Then he struck a rock, bounded off, and splashed into the water.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44125' title='44125'>I listened with amazement to this explanation, which Holmes delivered between the puffs of his cigarette.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44126' title='44126'>'But the tracks!' I cried. </span>
<span sid='44127' title='44127'>'I saw with my own eyes that two went down the path and none returned.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44128' title='44128'>'It came about in this way. </span>
<span sid='44129' title='44129'>The instant that the professor had disappeared it struck me what a really extraordinarily lucky chance Fate had placed in my way. </span>
<span sid='44130' title='44130'>I knew that Moriarty was not the only man who had sworn my death. </span>
<span sid='44131' title='44131'>There were at least three others whose desire for vengeance upon me would only be increased by the death of their leader. </span>
<span sid='44132' title='44132'>They were all most dangerous men. </span>
<span sid='44133' title='44133'>One or other would certainly get me. </span>
<span sid='44134' title='44134'>On the other hand, if all the world was convinced that I was dead they would take liberties, these men; they would lay themselves open, and sooner or later I could destroy them. </span>
<span sid='44135' title='44135'>Then it would be time for me to announce that I was still in the land of the living. </span>
<span sid='44136' title='44136'>So rapidly does the brain act that I believe I had thought this all out before Professor Moriarty had reached the bottom of the Reichenbach Fall.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44137' title='44137'>'I stood up and examined the rocky wall behind me. </span>
<span sid='44138' title='44138'>In your picturesque account of the matter, which I read with great interest some months later, you assert that the wall was sheer. </span>
<span sid='44139' title='44139'>This was not literally true. </span>
<span sid='44140' title='44140'>A few small footholds presented themselves, and there was some indication of a ledge. </span>
<span sid='44141' title='44141'>The cliff is so high that to climb it all was an obvious impossibility, and it was equally impossible to make my way along the wet path without leaving some tracks. </span>
<span sid='44142' title='44142'>I might, it is true, have reversed my boots, as I have done on similar occasions, but the sight of three sets of tracks in one direction would certainly have suggested a deception. </span>
<span sid='44143' title='44143'>On the whole, then, it was best that I should risk the climb. </span>
<span sid='44144' title='44144'>It was not a pleasant business, Watson. </span>
<span sid='44145' title='44145'>The fall roared beneath me. </span>
<span sid='44146' title='44146'>I am not a fanciful person, but I give you my word that I seemed to hear Moriarty's voice screaming at me out of the abyss. </span>
<span sid='44147' title='44147'>A mistake would have been fatal. </span>
<span sid='44148' title='44148'>More than once, as tufts of grass came out in my hand or my foot slipped in the wet notches of the rock, I thought that I was gone. </span>
<span sid='44149' title='44149'>But I struggled upwards, and at last I reached a ledge several feet deep and covered with soft green moss, where I could lie unseen in the most perfect comfort. </span>
<span sid='44150' title='44150'>There I was stretched when you, my dear Watson, and all your following were investigating in the most sympathetic and inefficient manner the circumstances of my death.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44151' title='44151'>'At last, when you had all formed your inevitable and totally erroneous conclusions, you departed for the hotel, and I was left alone. </span>
<span sid='44152' title='44152'>I had imagined that I had reached the end of my adventures, but a very unexpected occurrence showed me that there were surprises still in store for me. </span>
<span sid='44153' title='44153'>A huge rock, falling from above, boomed past me, struck the path, and bounded over into the chasm. </span>
<span sid='44154' title='44154'>For an instant I thought that it was an accident; but a moment later, looking up, I saw a man's head against the darkening sky, and another stone struck the very ledge upon which I was stretched, within a foot of my head. </span>
<span sid='44155' title='44155'>Of course, the meaning of this was obvious. </span>
<span sid='44156' title='44156'>Moriarty had not been alone. </span>
<span sid='44157' title='44157'>A confederate - and even that one glance had told me how dangerous a man that confederate was - had kept guard while the professor had attacked me. </span>
<span sid='44158' title='44158'>From a distance, unseen by me, he had been a witness of his friend's death and of my escape. </span>
<span sid='44159' title='44159'>He had waited, and then, making his way round to the top of the cliff, he had endeavoured to succeed where his comrade had failed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44160' title='44160'>'I did not take long to think about it, Watson. </span>
<span sid='44161' title='44161'>Again I saw that grim face look over the cliff, and I knew that it was the precursor of another stone. </span>
<span sid='44162' title='44162'>I scrambled down on to the path. </span>
<span sid='44163' title='44163'>I don't think I could have done it in cold blood. </span>
<span sid='44164' title='44164'>It was a hundred times more difficult than getting up. </span>
<span sid='44165' title='44165'>But I had no time to think of the danger, for another stone sang past me as I hung by my hands from the edge of the ledge. </span>
<span sid='44166' title='44166'>Half-way down I slipped, but by the blessing of God I landed, torn and bleeding, upon the path. </span>
<span sid='44167' title='44167'>I took to my heels, did ten miles over the mountains in the darkness, and a week later I found myself in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Florence&t=h'>Florence</a>, with the certainty that no one in the world knew what had become of me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44168' title='44168'>'I had only one confidant - my brother Mycroft. </span>
<span sid='44169' title='44169'>I owe you many apologies, my dear Watson, but it was all-important that it should be thought I was dead, and it is quite certain that you would not have written so convincing an account of my unhappy end had you not yourself thought that it was true. </span>
<span sid='44170' title='44170'>Several times during the last three years I have taken up my pen to write to you, but always I feared lest your affectionate regard for me should tempt you to some indiscretion which would betray my secret. </span>
<span sid='44171' title='44171'>For that reason I turned away from you this evening when you upset my books, for I was in danger at the time, and any show of surprise and emotion upon your part might have drawn attention to my identity and led to the most deplorable and irreparable results. </span>
<span sid='44172' title='44172'>As to Mycroft, I had to confide in him in order to obtain the money which I needed. </span>
<span sid='44173' title='44173'>The course of events in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> did not run so well as I had hoped, for the trial of the Moriarty gang left two of its most dangerous members, my own most vindictive enemies, at liberty. </span>
<span sid='44174' title='44174'>I travelled for two years in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Tibet&t=h'>Tibet</a>, therefore, and amused myself by visiting <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lhassa&t=h'>Lhassa</a> and spending some days with the head Llama. </span>
<span sid='44175' title='44175'>You may have read of the remarkable explorations of a Norwegian named Sigerson, but I am sure that it never occurred to you that you were receiving news of your friend. </span>
<span sid='44176' title='44176'>I then passed through <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Persia&t=h'>Persia</a>, looked in at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Mecca&t=h'>Mecca</a>, and paid a short but interesting visit to the Khalifa at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Khartoum&t=h'>Khartoum</a>, the results of which I have communicated to the Foreign Office. </span>
<span sid='44177' title='44177'>Returning to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>, I spent some months in a research into the coal-tar derivatives, which I conducted in a laboratory at Montpelier, in the south of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>. </span>
<span sid='44178' title='44178'>Having concluded this to my satisfaction, and learning that only one of my enemies was now left in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, I was about to return, when my movements were hastened by the news of this remarkable <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Park Lane&t=h'>Park Lane</a> Mystery, which not only appealed to me by its own merits, but which seemed to offer some most peculiar personal opportunities. </span>
<span sid='44179' title='44179'>I came over at once to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, called in my own person at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>, threw Mrs. Hudson into violent hysterics, and found that Mycroft had preserved my rooms and my papers exactly as they had always been. </span>
<span sid='44180' title='44180'>So it was, my dear Watson, that at two o'clock to-day I found myself in my old arm-chair in my own old room, and only wishing that I could have seen my old friend Watson in the other chair which he has so often adorned.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44181' title='44181'>Such was the remarkable narrative to which I listened on that April evening - a narrative which would have been utterly incredible to me had it not been confirmed by the actual sight of the tall, spare figure and the keen, eager face which I had never thought to see again. </span>
<span sid='44182' title='44182'>In some manner he had learned of my own sad bereavement, and his sympathy was shown in his manner rather than in his words. </span>
<span sid='44183' title='44183'>'Work is the best antidote to sorrow, my dear Watson,' said he, 'and I have a piece of work for us both to-night which, if we can bring it to a successful conclusion, will in itself justify a man's life on this planet.' </span>
<span sid='44184' title='44184'>In vain I begged him to tell me more. </span>
<span sid='44185' title='44185'>'You will hear and see enough before morning,' he answered. </span>
<span sid='44186' title='44186'>'We have three years of the past to discuss. </span>
<span sid='44187' title='44187'>Let that suffice until half past nine, when we start upon the notable adventure of the empty house.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44188' title='44188'>It was indeed like old times when, at that hour, I found myself seated beside him in a hansom, my revolver in my pocket and the thrill of adventure in my heart. </span>
<span sid='44189' title='44189'>Holmes was cold and stern and silent. </span>
<span sid='44190' title='44190'>As the gleam of the street-lamps flashed upon his austere features, I saw that his brows were drawn down in thought and his thin lips compressed. </span>
<span sid='44191' title='44191'>I knew not what wild beast we were about to hunt down in the dark jungle of criminal <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, but I was well assured from the bearing of this master huntsman that the adventure was a most grave one, while the sardonic smile which occasionally broke through his ascetic gloom boded little good for the object of our quest.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44192' title='44192'>I had imagined that we were bound for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>, but Holmes stopped the cab at the corner of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Cavendish Square&t=h'>Cavendish Square</a>. </span>
<span sid='44193' title='44193'>I observed that as he stepped out he gave a most searching glance to right and left, and at every subsequent street corner he took the utmost pains to assure that he was not followed. </span>
<span sid='44194' title='44194'>Our route was certainly a singular one. </span>
<span sid='44195' title='44195'>Holmes's knowledge of the by-ways of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> was extraordinary, and on this occasion he passed rapidly, and with an assured step, through a network of mews and stables the very existence of which I had never known. </span>
<span sid='44196' title='44196'>We emerged at last into a small road, lined with old, gloomy houses, which led us into <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Manchester Street&t=h'>Manchester Street</a>, and so to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Blandford Street&t=h'>Blandford Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='44197' title='44197'>Here he turned swiftly down a narrow passage, passed through a wooden gate into a deserted yard, and then opened with a key the back door of a house. </span>
<span sid='44198' title='44198'>We entered together, and he closed it behind us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44199' title='44199'>The place was pitch dark, but it was evident to me that it was an empty house. </span>
<span sid='44200' title='44200'>Our feet creaked and crackled over the bare planking, and my outstretched hand touched a wall from which the paper was hanging in ribbons. </span>
<span sid='44201' title='44201'>Holmes's cold, thin fingers closed round my wrist and led me forward down a long hall, until I dimly saw the murky fanlight over the door. </span>
<span sid='44202' title='44202'>Here Holmes turned suddenly to the right, and We found ourselves in a large, square, empty room, heavily shadowed in the corners, but faintly lit in the centre from the lights of the street beyond. </span>
<span sid='44203' title='44203'>There was no lamp near, and the window was thick with dust, so that we could only just discern each other's figures within. </span>
<span sid='44204' title='44204'>My companion put his hand upon my shoulder, and his lips close to my ear.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44205' title='44205'>'Do you know where we are?' he whispered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44206' title='44206'>'Surely that is <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>,' I answered, staring through the dim window.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44207' title='44207'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='44208' title='44208'>We are in Camden House, which stands opposite to our own old quarters.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44209' title='44209'>'But why are we here?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44210' title='44210'>'Because it commands so excellent a view of that picturesque pile. </span>
<span sid='44211' title='44211'>Might I trouble you, my dear Watson, to draw a little nearer to the window, taking every precaution not to show yourself, and then to look up at our old rooms - the starting-point of so many of our little adventures? </span>
<span sid='44212' title='44212'>We will see if my three years of absence have entirely taken away my power to surprise you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44213' title='44213'>I crept forward and looked across at the familiar window. </span>
<span sid='44214' title='44214'>As my eyes fell upon it I gave a gasp and a cry of amazement. </span>
<span sid='44215' title='44215'>The blind was down, and a strong light was burning in the room. </span>
<span sid='44216' title='44216'>The shadow of a man who was seated in a chair within was thrown in hard, black outline upon the luminous screen of the window. </span>
<span sid='44217' title='44217'>There was no mistaking the poise of the head, the squareness of the shoulders, the sharpness of the features. </span>
<span sid='44218' title='44218'>The face was turned half-round, and the effect was that of one of those black silhouettes which our grandparents loved to frame. </span>
<span sid='44219' title='44219'>It was a perfect reproduction of Holmes. </span>
<span sid='44220' title='44220'>So amazed was I that I threw out my hand to make sure that the man himself was standing beside me. </span>
<span sid='44221' title='44221'>He was quivering with silent laughter.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44222' title='44222'>'Well?' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44223' title='44223'>'Good heavens!' I cried. </span>
<span sid='44224' title='44224'>'It's marvellous!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44225' title='44225'>'I trust that age doth not wither nor custom stale my infinite variety,' said he, and I recognized in his voice the joy and pride which the artist takes in his own creation. </span>
<span sid='44226' title='44226'>'It really is rather like me, is it not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44227' title='44227'>'I should be prepared to swear that it was you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44228' title='44228'>'The credit of the execution is due to Monsieur Oscar Meunier, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Grenoble&t=h'>Grenoble</a>, who spent some days in doing the moulding. </span>
<span sid='44229' title='44229'>It is a bust in wax. </span>
<span sid='44230' title='44230'>The rest I arranged myself during my visit to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> this afternoon.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44231' title='44231'>'But why?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44232' title='44232'>'Because, my dear Watson, I had the strongest possible reason for wishing certain people to think that I was there when I was really elsewhere.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44233' title='44233'>'And you thought the rooms were watched?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44234' title='44234'>'I knew that they were watched.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44235' title='44235'>'By whom?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44236' title='44236'>'By my old enemies, Watson. </span>
<span sid='44237' title='44237'>By the charming society whose leader lies in the Reichenbach Fall. </span>
<span sid='44238' title='44238'>You must remember that they knew, and only they knew, that I was still alive. </span>
<span sid='44239' title='44239'>Sooner or later they believed that I should come back to my rooms. </span>
<span sid='44240' title='44240'>They watched them continuously, and this morning they saw me arrive.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44241' title='44241'>'How do you know?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44242' title='44242'>'Because I recognized their sentinel when I glanced out of my window. </span>
<span sid='44243' title='44243'>He is a harmless enough fellow, Parker by name, a garrotter by trade, and a remarkable performer upon the jews' harp. </span>
<span sid='44244' title='44244'>I cared nothing for him. </span>
<span sid='44245' title='44245'>But I cared a great deal for the much more formidable person who was behind him, the bosom friend of Moriarty, the man who dropped the rocks over the cliff, the most cunning and dangerous criminal in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='44246' title='44246'>That is the man who is after me tonight, Watson, and that is the man who is quite unaware that we are after him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44247' title='44247'>My friend's plans were gradually revealing themselves. </span>
<span sid='44248' title='44248'>From this convenient retreat the watchers were being watched and the trackers tracked. </span>
<span sid='44249' title='44249'>That angular shadow up yonder was the bait, and we were the hunters. </span>
<span sid='44250' title='44250'>In silence we stood together in the darkness and watched the hurrying figures who passed and repassed in front of us. </span>
<span sid='44251' title='44251'>Holmes was silent and motionless; but I could tell that he was keenly alert, and that his eyes were fixed intently upon the stream of passers-by. </span>
<span sid='44252' title='44252'>It was a bleak and boisterous night, and the wind whistled shrilly down the long street. </span>
<span sid='44253' title='44253'>Many people were moving to and fro, most of them muffled in their coats and cravats. </span>
<span sid='44254' title='44254'>Once or twice it seemed to me that I had seen the same figure before, and I especially noticed two men who appeared to be sheltering themselves from the wind in the doorway of a house some distance up the street. </span>
<span sid='44255' title='44255'>I tried to draw my companion's attention to them, but he gave a little ejaculation of impatience, and continued to stare into the street. </span>
<span sid='44256' title='44256'>More than once he fidgeted with his feet and tapped rapidly with his fingers upon the wall. </span>
<span sid='44257' title='44257'>It was evident to me that he was becoming uneasy, and that his plans were not working out altogether as he had hoped. </span>
<span sid='44258' title='44258'>At last, as midnight approached and the street gradually cleared, he paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. </span>
<span sid='44259' title='44259'>I was about to make some remark to him, when I raised my eyes to the lighted window, and again experienced almost as great a surprise as before. </span>
<span sid='44260' title='44260'>I clutched Holmes's arm and pointed upwards.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44261' title='44261'>'The shadow has moved!' I cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44262' title='44262'>It was, indeed, no longer the profile, but the back which was turned towards us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44263' title='44263'>Three years had certainly not smoothed the asperities of his temper, or his impatience with a less active intelligence than his own.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44264' title='44264'>'Of course it has moved,' said he. </span>
<span sid='44265' title='44265'>'Am I such a farcical bungler, Watson, that I should erect an obvious dummy and expect that some of the sharpest men in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a> would be deceived by it? </span>
<span sid='44266' title='44266'>We have been in this room two hours, and Mrs. Hudson has made some change in that figure eight times, or once every quarter of an hour. </span>
<span sid='44267' title='44267'>She works it from the front, so that her shadow may never be seen. </span>
<span sid='44268' title='44268'>Ah!' </span>
<span sid='44269' title='44269'>He drew in his breath with a shrill, excited intake. </span>
<span sid='44270' title='44270'>In the dim light I saw his head thrown forward, his whole attitude rigid with attention. </span>
<span sid='44271' title='44271'>Those two men might still be crouching in the doorway, but I could no longer see them. </span>
<span sid='44272' title='44272'>All was still and dark, save only that brilliant yellow screen in front of us with the black figure outlined upon its centre. </span>
<span sid='44273' title='44273'>Again in the utter silence I heard that thin, sibilant note which spoke of intense suppressed excitement. </span>
<span sid='44274' title='44274'>An instant later he pulled me back into the blackest corner of the room, and I felt his warning hand upon my lips. </span>
<span sid='44275' title='44275'>The fingers which clutched me were quivering. </span>
<span sid='44276' title='44276'>Never had I known my friend more moved, and yet the dark street still stretched lonely and motionless before us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44277' title='44277'>But suddenly I was aware of that which his keener senses had already distinguished. </span>
<span sid='44278' title='44278'>A low, stealthy sound came to my ears, not from the direction of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>, but from the back of the very house in which we lay concealed. </span>
<span sid='44279' title='44279'>A door opened and shut. </span>
<span sid='44280' title='44280'>An instant later steps crept down the passage - steps which were meant to be silent, but which reverberated harshly through the empty house. </span>
<span sid='44281' title='44281'>Holmes crouched back against the wall, and I did the same, my hand closing upon the handle of my revolver. </span>
<span sid='44282' title='44282'>Peering through the gloom, I saw the vague outline of a man a shade blacker than the blackness of the open door. </span>
<span sid='44283' title='44283'>He stood for an instant, and then he crept forward, crouching, menacing, into the room. </span>
<span sid='44284' title='44284'>He was within three yards of us, this sinister figure, and I had braced myself to meet his spring, before I realized that he had no idea of our presence. </span>
<span sid='44285' title='44285'>He passed close beside us, stole over to the window, and very softly and noiselessly raised it for half a foot. </span>
<span sid='44286' title='44286'>As he sank to the level of this opening the light of the street, no longer dimmed by the dusty glass, fell full upon his face. </span>
<span sid='44287' title='44287'>The man seemed to be beside himself with excitement. </span>
<span sid='44288' title='44288'>His two eyes shone like stars, and his features were working convulsively. </span>
<span sid='44289' title='44289'>He was an elderly man, with a thin projecting nose, a high, bald forehead, and a huge grizzled moustache. </span>
<span sid='44290' title='44290'>An opera-hat was pushed to the back of his head, and an evening dress shirt-front gleamed out through his open overcoat. </span>
<span sid='44291' title='44291'>His face was gaunt and swarthy, scored with deep, savage lines. </span>
<span sid='44292' title='44292'>In his hand he carried what appeared to be a stick, but as he laid it down upon the floor it gave a metallic clang. </span>
<span sid='44293' title='44293'>Then from the pocket of his overcoat he drew a bulky object, and he busied himself in some task which ended with a loud, sharp click, as if a spring or bolt had fallen into its place. </span>
<span sid='44294' title='44294'>Still kneeling upon the floor, he bent forward and threw all his weight and strength upon some lever, with the result that there came a long, whirling, grinding noise, ending once more in a powerful click. </span>
<span sid='44295' title='44295'>He straightened himself then, and I saw that what he held in his hand was a sort of a gun, with a curiously misshapen butt. </span>
<span sid='44296' title='44296'>He opened it at the breech, put something in, and snapped the breech-block. </span>
<span sid='44297' title='44297'>Then, crouching down, he rested the end of the barrel upon the ledge of the open window, and I saw his long moustache droop over the stock and his eye gleam as it peered along the sights. </span>
<span sid='44298' title='44298'>I heard a little sigh of satisfaction as he cuddled the butt into his shoulder, and saw that amazing target, the black man on the yellow ground, standing clear at the end of his foresight. </span>
<span sid='44299' title='44299'>For an instant he was rigid and motionless. </span>
<span sid='44300' title='44300'>Then his finger tightened on the trigger. </span>
<span sid='44301' title='44301'>There was a strange, loud whiz and a long, silvery tinkle of broken glass. </span>
<span sid='44302' title='44302'>At that instant Holmes sprang like a tiger on to the marksman's back and hurled him flat upon his face. </span>
<span sid='44303' title='44303'>He was up again at a moment, and with convulsive strength he seized Holmes by the throat; but I struck him on the head with the butt of my revolver, and he dropped again upon the floor. </span>
<span sid='44304' title='44304'>I fell upon him, and as I held him my comrade blew a shrill call upon a whistle. </span>
<span sid='44305' title='44305'>There was the clatter of running feet upon the pavement, and two policemen in uniform, with one plain-clothes detective, rushed through the front entrance and into the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44306' title='44306'>'That you, Lestrade?' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44307' title='44307'>'Yes, Mr. Holmes. </span>
<span sid='44308' title='44308'>I took the job myself. </span>
<span sid='44309' title='44309'>It's good to see you back in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44310' title='44310'>'I think you want a little unofficial help. </span>
<span sid='44311' title='44311'>Three undetected murders in one year won't do, Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='44312' title='44312'>But you handled the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Molesey&t=h'>Molesey</a> Mystery with less than your usual - that's to say, you handled it fairly well.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44313' title='44313'>We had all risen to our feet, our prisoner breathing hard, with a stalwart constable on each side of him. </span>
<span sid='44314' title='44314'>Already a few loiterers had begun to collect in the street. </span>
<span sid='44315' title='44315'>Holmes stepped up to the window, closed it, and dropped the blinds. </span>
<span sid='44316' title='44316'>Lestrade had produced two candles, and the policemen had uncovered their lanterns. </span>
<span sid='44317' title='44317'>I was able at last to have a good look at our prisoner.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44318' title='44318'>It was a tremendously virile and yet sinister face which was turned towards us. </span>
<span sid='44319' title='44319'>With the brow of a philosopher above and the jaw of a sensualist below, the man must have started with great capacities for good or for evil. </span>
<span sid='44320' title='44320'>But one could not look upon his cruel blue eyes, with their drooping, cynical lids, or upon the fierce, aggressive nose and the threatening, deeplined brow, without reading Nature's plainest danger signals. </span>
<span sid='44321' title='44321'>He took no heed of any of us, but his eyes were fixed upon Holmes's face with an expression in which hatred and amazement were equally blended. </span>
<span sid='44322' title='44322'>'You fiend!' </span>
<span sid='44323' title='44323'>he kept on muttering - 'you clever, clever fiend!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44324' title='44324'>'Ah, colonel,' said Holmes, arranging his rumpled collar, '"journeys end in lovers' meetings," as the old play says. </span>
<span sid='44325' title='44325'>I don't think I have had the pleasure of seeing you since you favoured me with those attentions as I lay on the ledge above the Reichenbach Fall.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44326' title='44326'>The colonel still stared at my friend like a man in a trance. </span>
<span sid='44327' title='44327'>'You cunning, cunning fiend!' was all that he could say.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44328' title='44328'>'I have not introduced you yet,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='44329' title='44329'>'This, gentlemen, is Colonel Sebastian Moran, once of Her Majesty's Indian Army, and the best heavy game shot that our Eastern Empire has ever produced. </span>
<span sid='44330' title='44330'>I believe I am correct, colonel, in saying that your bag of tigers still remain unrivalled?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44331' title='44331'>The fierce old man said nothing, but still glared at my companion; with his savage eyes and bristling moustache, he was wonderfully like a tiger himself.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44332' title='44332'>'I wonder that my very simple stratagem could deceive so old a shikari,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='44333' title='44333'>'It must be very familiar to you. </span>
<span sid='44334' title='44334'>Have you not tethered a young kid under a tree, lain above it with your rifle, and waited for the bait to bring up your tiger? </span>
<span sid='44335' title='44335'>This empty house is my tree, and you are my tiger. </span>
<span sid='44336' title='44336'>You have possibly had other guns in reserve in case there should be several tigers, or in the unlikely supposition of your own aim failing you. </span>
<span sid='44337' title='44337'>These,' he pointed around, 'are my other guns. </span>
<span sid='44338' title='44338'>The parallel is exact.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44339' title='44339'>Colonel Moran sprang forward with a snarl of rage, but the constables dragged him back. </span>
<span sid='44340' title='44340'>The fury upon his face was terrible to look at.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44341' title='44341'>'I confess that you had one small surprise for me,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='44342' title='44342'>'I did not anticipate that you would yourself make use of this empty house and this convenient front window. </span>
<span sid='44343' title='44343'>I had imagined you as operating from the street, where my friend Lestrade and his merry men were awaiting you. </span>
<span sid='44344' title='44344'>With that exception, all has gone as I expected.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44345' title='44345'>Colonel Moran turned to the official detective.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44346' title='44346'>'You may or may not have just cause for arresting me,' said he, 'but at least there can be no reason why I should submit to the gibes of this person. </span>
<span sid='44347' title='44347'>If I am in the hands of the law, let things be done in a legal way.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44348' title='44348'>'Well, that's reasonable enough,' said Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='44349' title='44349'>'Nothing further you have to say, Mr. Holmes, before we go?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44350' title='44350'>Holmes had picked up the powerful air-gun from the floor, and was examining its mechanism.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44351' title='44351'>'An admirable and unique weapon,' said he, 'noiseless and of tremendous power. </span>
<span sid='44352' title='44352'>I knew Von Herder, the blind German mechanic, who constructed it to the order of the late Professor Moriarty. </span>
<span sid='44353' title='44353'>For years I have been aware of its existence, though I have never before had an opportunity of handling it. </span>
<span sid='44354' title='44354'>I commend it very specially to your attention, Lestrade, and also the bullets which fit it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44355' title='44355'>'You can trust us to look after that, Mr. Holmes,' said Lestrade, as the whole party moved towards the door. </span>
<span sid='44356' title='44356'>'Anything further to say?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44357' title='44357'>'Only to ask what charge you intend to prefer?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44358' title='44358'>'What charge, sir? </span>
<span sid='44359' title='44359'>Why, of course, the attempted murder of Mr. Sherlock Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44360' title='44360'>'Not so, Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='44361' title='44361'>I do not propose to appear in the matter at all. </span>
<span sid='44362' title='44362'>To you, and to you only, belongs the credit of the remarkable arrest which you have effected. </span>
<span sid='44363' title='44363'>Yes, Lestrade, I congratulate you! </span>
<span sid='44364' title='44364'>With your usual happy mixture of cunning and audacity you have got him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44365' title='44365'>'Got him! </span>
<span sid='44366' title='44366'>Got whom, Mr. Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44367' title='44367'>'The man whom the whole Force has been seeking in vain - Colonel Sebastian Moran, who shot the Honourable Ronald Adair with an expanding bullet from an air-gun through the open window of the second-floor front of No. 427 <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Park Lane&t=h'>Park Lane</a>, upon the 30th of last month. </span>
<span sid='44368' title='44368'>That's the charge, Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='44369' title='44369'>And now, Watson, if you can endure the draught from a broken window, I think that half an hour in my study over a cigar may afford you some profitable amusement.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44370' title='44370'>Our old chambers had been left unchanged, through the supervision of Mycroft Holmes and the immediate care of Mrs. Hudson. </span>
<span sid='44371' title='44371'>As I entered I saw, it is true, an unwonted tidiness, but the old landmarks were all in their places. </span>
<span sid='44372' title='44372'>There were the chemical corner and the acid-stained deal-topped table. </span>
<span sid='44373' title='44373'>There upon a shelf was the row of formidable scrap-books and books of reference which many of our fellow-citizens would have been so glad to burn. </span>
<span sid='44374' title='44374'>The diagrams, the violin-case, and the pipe-rack - even the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Persia&t=h'>Persia</a>n slipper which contained the tobacco - all met my eye as I glanced round me. </span>
<span sid='44375' title='44375'>There were two occupants of the room-one Mrs. Hudson, who beamed upon us both as we entered; the other, the strange dummy which had played so important a part in the evening's adventures. </span>
<span sid='44376' title='44376'>It was a wax-coloured model of my friend, so admirably done that it was a perfect facsimile. </span>
<span sid='44377' title='44377'>It stood on a small pedestal table with an old dressing gown of Holmes's so draped round it that the illusion from the street was absolutely perfect.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44378' title='44378'>'I hope you preserved all precautions, Mrs. Hudson?' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44379' title='44379'>'I went to it on my knees, sir, just as you told me!</span>
<p>
<span sid='44380' title='44380'>'Excellent. </span>
<span sid='44381' title='44381'>You carried the thing out very well. </span>
<span sid='44382' title='44382'>Did you observe where the bullet went?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44383' title='44383'>'Yes, sir. </span>
<span sid='44384' title='44384'>I'm afraid it has spoilt your beautiful bust, for it passed right through the head and flattened itself on the wall. </span>
<span sid='44385' title='44385'>I picked it up from the carpet. </span>
<span sid='44386' title='44386'>Here it is!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44387' title='44387'>Holmes held it out to me. </span>
<span sid='44388' title='44388'>'A soft revolver bullet, as you perceive, Watson. </span>
<span sid='44389' title='44389'>There's genius in that - for who would expect to find such a thing fired from an air-gun? </span>
<span sid='44390' title='44390'>All right, Mrs. Hudson, I am much obliged for your assistance. </span>
<span sid='44391' title='44391'>And now, Watson, let me see you in your old seat once more, for there are several points which I should like to discuss with you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44392' title='44392'>He had thrown off the seedy frock-coat, and now he was the Holmes of old, in the mouse-coloured dressing-gown which he took from his effigy.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44393' title='44393'>'The old shikari's nerves have not lost their steadiness nor his eyes their keenness,' said he, with a laugh, as he inspected the shattered forehead of his bust.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44394' title='44394'>'Plumb in the middle of the back of the head and smack through the brain. </span>
<span sid='44395' title='44395'>He was the best shot in India, and I expect that there are few better in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='44396' title='44396'>Have you heard the name?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44397' title='44397'>'No, I have not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44398' title='44398'>'Well, well, such is fame! </span>
<span sid='44399' title='44399'>But then, if I remember aright, you had not heard the name of Professor James Moriarty, who had one of the great brains of the century. </span>
<span sid='44400' title='44400'>Just give me down my index of biographies from the shelf.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44401' title='44401'>He turned over the pages lazily, leaning back in his chair and blowing great clouds of smoke from his cigar.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44402' title='44402'>'My collection of M's is a fine one,' said he. </span>
<span sid='44403' title='44403'>'Moriarty himself is enough to make any letter illustrious, and here is Morgan the poisoner, and Merridew of abominable memory, and Mathews, who knocked out my left canine in the waiting-room at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Charing Cross&t=h'>Charing Cross</a>, and, finally, here is our friend of to-night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44404' title='44404'>He handed over the book, and I read: ' Moran, Sebastian, Colonel. </span>
<span sid='44405' title='44405'>Unemployed. </span>

<p>
<span sid='44414' title='44414'>On the margin was written in Holmes's precise hand: 'The second most dangerous man in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44415' title='44415'>'This is astonishing,' said I, as I handed back the volume. </span>
<span sid='44416' title='44416'>'The man's career is that of an honourable soldier.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44417' title='44417'>'It is true,' Holmes answered. </span>
<span sid='44418' title='44418'>'Up to a certain point he did well. </span>
<span sid='44419' title='44419'>He was always a man of iron nerve, and the story is still told in India how he crawled down a drain after a wounded man-eating tiger. </span>
<span sid='44420' title='44420'>There are some trees, Watson, which grow to a certain height and then suddenly develop some unsightly eccentricity. </span>
<span sid='44421' title='44421'>You will see it often in humans. </span>
<span sid='44422' title='44422'>I have a theory that the individual represents in his development the whole procession of his ancestors, and that such a sudden turn to good or evil stands for some strong influence which came into the line of his pedigree. </span>
<span sid='44423' title='44423'>The person becomes, as it were, the epitome of the history of his own family.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44424' title='44424'>'It is surely rather fanciful.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44425' title='44425'>'Well, I don't insist upon it. </span>
<span sid='44426' title='44426'>Whatever the cause, Colonel Moran began to go wrong. </span>
<span sid='44427' title='44427'>Without any open scandal, he still made India too hot to hold him. </span>
<span sid='44428' title='44428'>He retired, came to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, and again acquired an evil name. </span>
<span sid='44429' title='44429'>It was at this time that he was sought out by Professor Moriarty, to whom for a time he was chief of the staff. </span>
<span sid='44430' title='44430'>Moriarty supplied him liberally with money, and used him only in one or two very high class jobs which no ordinary criminal could have undertaken. </span>
<span sid='44431' title='44431'>You may have some recollection of the death of Mrs. Stewart, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lauder&t=h'>Lauder</a>, in 1887. </span>
<span sid='44432' title='44432'>Not? </span>
<span sid='44433' title='44433'>Well, I am sure Moran was at the bottom of it; but nothing could be proved. </span>
<span sid='44434' title='44434'>So cleverly was the colonel concealed that even when the Moriarty gang was broken up we could not incriminate him. </span>
<span sid='44435' title='44435'>You remember at that date, when I called upon you in your rooms, how I put up the shutters for fear of air-guns? </span>
<span sid='44436' title='44436'>No doubt you thought me fanciful. </span>
<span sid='44437' title='44437'>I knew exactly what I was doing, for I knew of the existence of this remarkable gun, and I knew also that one of the best shots in the world would be behind it. </span>
<span sid='44438' title='44438'>When we were in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Switzerland&t=h'>Switzerland</a> he followed us with Moriarty, and it was undoubtedly he who gave me that evil five minutes on the Reichenbach ledge.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44439' title='44439'>'You may think that I read the papers with some attention during my sojourn in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=France&t=h'>France</a>, on the lookout for any chance of laying him by the heels. </span>
<span sid='44440' title='44440'>So long as he was free in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> my life would really not have been worth living. </span>
<span sid='44441' title='44441'>Night and day the shadow would have been over me, and sooner or later his chance must have come. </span>
<span sid='44442' title='44442'>What could I do? </span>
<span sid='44443' title='44443'>I could not shoot him at sight, or I should myself be in the dock. </span>
<span sid='44444' title='44444'>There was no use appealing to a magistrate. </span>
<span sid='44445' title='44445'>They cannot interfere on the strength of what would appear to them to be a wild suspicion. </span>
<span sid='44446' title='44446'>So I could do nothing. </span>
<span sid='44447' title='44447'>But I watched the criminal news, knowing that sooner or later I should get him. </span>
<span sid='44448' title='44448'>Then came the death of this Ronald Adair. </span>
<span sid='44449' title='44449'>My chance had come at last! </span>
<span sid='44450' title='44450'>Knowing what I did, was it not certain that Colonel Moran had done it? </span>
<span sid='44451' title='44451'>He had played cards with the lad; he had followed him home from the club; he had shot him through the open window. </span>
<span sid='44452' title='44452'>There was not a doubt of it. </span>
<span sid='44453' title='44453'>The bullets alone are enough to put his head in a noose. </span>
<span sid='44454' title='44454'>I came over at once. </span>
<span sid='44455' title='44455'>I was seen by the sentinel, who would, I knew, direct the colonel's attention to my presence. </span>
<span sid='44456' title='44456'>He could not fail to connect my sudden return with his crime, and to be terribly alarmed. </span>
<span sid='44457' title='44457'>I was sure that he would make an attempt to get me out of the way at once, and would bring round his murderous weapon for that purpose. </span>
<span sid='44458' title='44458'>I left him an excellent mark in the window, and, having warned the police that they might be needed - by the way, Watson, you spotted their presence in that doorway with unerring accuracy - I took up what seemed to me to be a judicious post for observation, never dreaming that he would choose the same spot for his attack. </span>
<span sid='44459' title='44459'>Now, my dear Watson, does anything remain for me to explain?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44460' title='44460'>'Yes,' said I. </span>
<span sid='44461' title='44461'>'You have not made it clear what was Colonel Moran's motive in murdering the Honourable Ronald Adair.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44462' title='44462'>'Ah! my dear Watson, there we come into those realms of conjecture where the most logical mind may be at fault. </span>
<span sid='44463' title='44463'>Each may form his own hypothesis upon the present evidence, and yours is as likely to be correct as mine.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44464' title='44464'>'You have formed one, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44465' title='44465'>'I think that it is not difficult to explain the facts. </span>
<span sid='44466' title='44466'>It came out in evidence that Colonel Moran and young Adair had between them won a considerable amount of money. </span>
<span sid='44467' title='44467'>Now, Moran undoubtedly played foul - of that I have long been aware. </span>
<span sid='44468' title='44468'>I believe that on the day of the murder, Adair had discovered that Moran was cheating. </span>
<span sid='44469' title='44469'>Very likely he had spoken to him privately, and had threatened to expose him unless he voluntarily resigned his membership of the club and promised not to play cards again. </span>
<span sid='44470' title='44470'>It is unlikely that a youngster like Adair would at once make a hideous scandal by exposing a well-known man so much older than himself. </span>
<span sid='44471' title='44471'>Probably he acted as I suggest. </span>
<span sid='44472' title='44472'>The exclusion from his clubs would mean ruin to Moran, who lived by his ill-gotten card gains. </span>
<span sid='44473' title='44473'>He therefore murdered Adair, who at the time was endeavouring to work out how much money he should himself return, since he could not profit by his partner's foul play. </span>
<span sid='44474' title='44474'>He locked the door, lest the ladies should surprise him and insist upon knowing what he was doing with these names and coins. </span>
<span sid='44475' title='44475'>Will it pass?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44476' title='44476'>'I have no doubt that you have hit upon the truth.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44477' title='44477'>'It will be verified or disproved at the trial. </span>
<span sid='44478' title='44478'>Meanwhile, come what may, Colonel Moran will trouble us no more, the famous air-gun of Von Herder will embellish the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a> Museum, and once again Mr. Sherlock Holmes is free to devote his life to examining those interesting little problems which the complex life of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> so plentifully presents.'</span>
