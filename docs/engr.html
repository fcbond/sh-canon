<p class="subtitle">Arthur Conan Doyle<label for="sn-meta-engr" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-meta-engr" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><!--googleoff: all--><b>Story Number</b>: 11<br><b>Published in</b>: The Strand Magazine in March 1892<br><b>Collected in</b>: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes<!--googleon: all--></span></p>
<p>
<span sid='52892' title='52892'>Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend Mr Sherlock Holmes for solution during the years of our intimacy, there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his notice, that of Mr Hatherley's thumb and that of Colonel Warburton's madness. </span>
<span sid='52893' title='52893'>Of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details, that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. </span>
<span sid='52894' title='52894'>The story has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth. </span>
<span sid='52895' title='52895'>At the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52896' title='52896'>It was in the summer of '89, not long after my marriage, that the events occurred which I am now about to summarize. </span>
<span sid='52897' title='52897'>I had returned to civil practice, and had finally abandoned Holmes in his <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> rooms, although I continually visited him, and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bohemia&t=h'>Bohemia</a>n habits so far as to come and visit us. </span>
<span sid='52898' title='52898'>My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at no very great distance from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Paddington Station&t=h'>Paddington Station</a>, I got a few patients from among the officials. </span>
<span sid='52899' title='52899'>One of these whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease was never weary of advertising my virtues, and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52900' title='52900'>One morning, at a little before seven o'clock, I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door, to announce that two men had come from Paddington, and were waiting in the consulting-room. </span>
<span sid='52901' title='52901'>I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. </span>
<span sid='52902' title='52902'>As I descended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room, and closed the door tightly behind him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52903' title='52903'>'I've got him here,' he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder; 'he's all right.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52904' title='52904'>'What is it, then?' I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52905' title='52905'>'It's a new patient,' he whispered. </span>
<span sid='52906' title='52906'>'I thought I'd bring him round myself; then he couldn't slip away. </span>
<span sid='52907' title='52907'>There he is, all safe and sound. </span>
<span sid='52908' title='52908'>I must go now, Doctor, I have my dooties, just the same as you.' </span>
<span sid='52909' title='52909'>And off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52910' title='52910'>I entered my consulting-room, and found a gentleman seated by the table. </span>
<span sid='52911' title='52911'>He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed, with a soft cloth cap, which he had laid down upon my books. </span>
<span sid='52912' title='52912'>Round one of his hands he had a handkerchief' wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. </span>
<span sid='52913' title='52913'>He was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale, and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52914' title='52914'>'I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,' said he. </span>
<span sid='52915' title='52915'>'But I have had a very serious accident during the night. </span>
<span sid='52916' title='52916'>I came in by train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. </span>
<span sid='52917' title='52917'>I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon the side table.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52918' title='52918'>I took it up and glanced at it. </span>
<span sid='52919' title='52919'>'Mr Victor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer, 16a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Victoria&t=h'>Victoria</a> Street (3rd floor).' </span>
<span sid='52920' title='52920'>That was the name, style, and abode of my morning visitor. </span>
<span sid='52921' title='52921'>'I regret that I have kept you waiting,' said I, sitting down in my library chair. </span>
<span sid='52922' title='52922'>'You are fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous occupation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52923' title='52923'>'Oh, my night could not be called monotonous,' said he, and laughed. </span>
<span sid='52924' title='52924'>He laughed very heartily, with a high ringing note, leaning back in his chair, and shaking his sides. </span>
<span sid='52925' title='52925'>All my medical instincts rose up against that laugh.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52926' title='52926'>'Stop it!' I cried. </span>
<span sid='52927' title='52927'>'Pull yourself together!' </span>
<span sid='52928' title='52928'>And I poured some water from a carafe.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52929' title='52929'>It was useless, however. </span>
<span sid='52930' title='52930'>He was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone. </span>
<span sid='52931' title='52931'>Presently he came to himself once more, very weary and blushing hotly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52932' title='52932'>'I have been making a fool of myself,' he gasped.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52933' title='52933'>'Not at all. </span>
<span sid='52934' title='52934'>Drink this!' </span>
<span sid='52935' title='52935'>I dashed some brandy into the water, and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52936' title='52936'>'That's better!' said he. </span>
<span sid='52937' title='52937'>'And now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52938' title='52938'>He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. </span>
<span sid='52939' title='52939'>It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. </span>
<span sid='52940' title='52940'>There were four protruding fingers and a horrid red spongy surface where the thumb should have been. </span>
<span sid='52941' title='52941'>It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52942' title='52942'>'Good heavens!' I cried, 'this is a terrible injury. </span>
<span sid='52943' title='52943'>It must have bled considerably.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52944' title='52944'>'Yes, it did. </span>
<span sid='52945' title='52945'>I fainted when it was done; and I think that I must have been senseless for a long time. </span>
<span sid='52946' title='52946'>When I came to, I found that it was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist, and braced it up with a twig.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52947' title='52947'>'Excellent! </span>
<span sid='52948' title='52948'>You should have been a surgeon.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52949' title='52949'>'It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own province.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52950' title='52950'>'This has been done,' said I, examining the wound, 'by a very heavy and sharp instrument.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52951' title='52951'>'A thing like a cleaver,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52952' title='52952'>'An accident, I presume?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52953' title='52953'>'By no means.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52954' title='52954'>'What, a murderous attack!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52955' title='52955'>'Very murderous indeed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52956' title='52956'>'You horrify me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52957' title='52957'>I sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it; and, finally, covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolized bandages. </span>
<span sid='52958' title='52958'>He lay back without wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52959' title='52959'>'How is that?' I asked, when I had finished.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52960' title='52960'>'Capital! </span>
<span sid='52961' title='52961'>Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man. </span>
<span sid='52962' title='52962'>I was very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52963' title='52963'>'Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. </span>
<span sid='52964' title='52964'>It is evidently trying to your nerves.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52965' title='52965'>'Oh, no; not now. </span>
<span sid='52966' title='52966'>I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement, for it is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up. </span>
<span sid='52967' title='52967'>And, even if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52968' title='52968'>'Ha!' cried I, 'if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my friend Mr Sherlock Holmes before you go to the official police.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52969' title='52969'>'Oh, I have heard of that fellow,' answered my visitor, 'and I should be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must use the official police as well. </span>
<span sid='52970' title='52970'>Would you give me an introduction to him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52971' title='52971'>'I'll do better. </span>
<span sid='52972' title='52972'>I'll take you round to him myself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52973' title='52973'>'I should be immensely obliged to you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52974' title='52974'>'We'll call a cab and go together. </span>
<span sid='52975' title='52975'>We shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him. </span>
<span sid='52976' title='52976'>Do you feel equal to it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52977' title='52977'>'Yes. </span>
<span sid='52978' title='52978'>I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52979' title='52979'>'Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an instant.' </span>
<span sid='52980' title='52980'>I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new acquaintance to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52981' title='52981'>Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of The Times, and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece. </span>
<span sid='52982' title='52982'>He received us in his quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal. </span>
<span sid='52983' title='52983'>When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52984' title='52984'>'It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr Hatherley,' said he. </span>
<span sid='52985' title='52985'>'Pray lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home. </span>
<span sid='52986' title='52986'>Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired, and keep up your strength with a little stimulant.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52987' title='52987'>'Thank you,' said my patient, 'but I have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me, and I 'think that your breakfast has completed the cure. </span>
<span sid='52988' title='52988'>I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='52989' title='52989'>Holmes sat in his big armchair, with the weary, heavy- lidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52990' title='52990'>'You must know,' said he, 'that I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing alone in lodgings in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='52991' title='52991'>By profession I am a hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Greenwich&t=h'>Greenwich</a>. </span>
<span sid='52992' title='52992'>Two years ago, having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father's death, I determined to start in business for myself, and took professional chambers in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Victoria&t=h'>Victoria</a> Street.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52993' title='52993'>'I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience. </span>
<span sid='52994' title='52994'>To me it has been exceptionally so. </span>
<span sid='52995' title='52995'>During two years I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me. </span>
<span sid='52996' title='52996'>My gross takings amount to twenty-seven pounds ten. </span>
<span sid='52997' title='52997'>Every day, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at all.</span>
<p>
<span sid='52998' title='52998'>'Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business. </span>
<span sid='52999' title='52999'>He brought up a card, too, with the name of "Colonel Lysander Stark" engraved upon it. </span>
<span sid='53000' title='53000'>Close at his heels came the Colonel himself, a man rather over the middle size but of an exceeding thinness. </span>
<span sid='53001' title='53001'>I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man. </span>
<span sid='53002' title='53002'>His whole face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. </span>
<span sid='53003' title='53003'>Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. </span>
<span sid='53004' title='53004'>He was plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than thirty.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53005' title='53005'>'"Mr Hatherley?" said he, with something of a German accent. </span>
<span sid='53006' title='53006'>"You have been recommended to me, Mr Hatherley, as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession, but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53007' title='53007'>'I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address. </span>
<span sid='53008' title='53008'>"May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?" I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53009' title='53009'>'"Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you just at this moment. </span>
<span sid='53010' title='53010'>I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor, and are residing alone in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53011' title='53011'>'"That is quite correct," I answered, "but you will excuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications. </span>
<span sid='53012' title='53012'>I understood that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='53013' title='53013'>'"Undoubtedly so. </span>
<span sid='53014' title='53014'>But you will find that all I say is really to the point. </span>
<span sid='53015' title='53015'>I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy is quite essential - absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53016' title='53016'>'"If I promise to keep a secret," said I, "you may absolutely depend upon my doing so."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53017' title='53017'>'He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye. </span>
<span sid='53018' title='53018'>"You do promise, then?" said he at last.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53019' title='53019'>'"Yes, I promise."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53020' title='53020'>'"Absolute and complete silence, before, during, and after? </span>
<span sid='53021' title='53021'>No reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?" </span>
<span sid='53022' title='53022'>"I have already given you my word."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53023' title='53023'>'"Very good." </span>
<span sid='53024' title='53024'>He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door. </span>
<span sid='53025' title='53025'>The passage outside was empty.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53026' title='53026'>'"That's all right," said he, coming back. </span>
<span sid='53027' title='53027'>"I know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their masters' affairs. </span>
<span sid='53028' title='53028'>Now we can talk in safety." </span>
<span sid='53029' title='53029'>He drew up his chair very close to mine, and began to stare at me again with the same questioning, and thoughtful look.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53030' title='53030'>'A feeling of repulsion and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. </span>
<span sid='53031' title='53031'>Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53032' title='53032'>'"I beg that you will state your business, sir," said I; "my time is of value." </span>
<span sid='53033' title='53033'>Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to my lips.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53034' title='53034'>'"How would fifty guineas for a night's work suit you?" he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53035' title='53035'>'"Most admirably."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53036' title='53036'>'"I say a night's work, but an hour's would be nearer the mark. </span>
<span sid='53037' title='53037'>I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear. </span>
<span sid='53038' title='53038'>If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves. </span>
<span sid='53039' title='53039'>What do you think of such a commission as that?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='53040' title='53040'>'"The work appears to be light, and the pay munificent." </span>
<span sid='53041' title='53041'>"Precisely so. </span>
<span sid='53042' title='53042'>We shall want you to come tonight by the last train."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53043' title='53043'>'"Where to?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='53044' title='53044'>'"To Eyford, in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Berkshire&t=h'>Berkshire</a>. </span>
<span sid='53045' title='53045'>It is a little place near the borders of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Oxfordshire&t=h'>Oxfordshire</a>, and within seven miles of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Reading&t=h'>Reading</a>. </span>
<span sid='53046' title='53046'>There is a train from Paddington which would bring you in there at about 11.15."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53047' title='53047'>'"Very good."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53048' title='53048'>'"I shall come down in a carriage to meet you." </span>
<span sid='53049' title='53049'>"There is a drive, then?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='53050' title='53050'>'"Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. </span>
<span sid='53051' title='53051'>It is a good seven miles from Eyford station."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53052' title='53052'>'Then we can hardly get there before midnight. </span>
<span sid='53053' title='53053'>I suppose there would be no chance of a train back. </span>
<span sid='53054' title='53054'>I should be compelled to stop the night."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53055' title='53055'>'"Yes, we could easily give you a shakedown."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53056' title='53056'>'"That is very awkward. </span>
<span sid='53057' title='53057'>Could I not come at some more convenient hour?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='53058' title='53058'>'"We have judged it best that you should come late. </span>
<span sid='53059' title='53059'>It is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying you, a young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession. </span>
<span sid='53060' title='53060'>Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do so."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53061' title='53061'>'I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be to me. </span>
<span sid='53062' title='53062'>"Not at all," said I; "I shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes. </span>
<span sid='53063' title='53063'>I should like, however, to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53064' title='53064'>'"Quite so. </span>
<span sid='53065' title='53065'>It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. </span>
<span sid='53066' title='53066'>I have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. </span>
<span sid='53067' title='53067'>I suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='53068' title='53068'>'"Entirely."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53069' title='53069'>'"Then the matter stands thus. </span>
<span sid='53070' title='53070'>You are probably aware that fuller's earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one or two places in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='53071' title='53071'>'"I have heard so."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53072' title='53072'>'"Some little time ago I bought a small place - a very small place - within ten miles of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Reading&t=h'>Reading</a>. </span>
<span sid='53073' title='53073'>I was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fuller's earth in one of my fields. </span>
<span sid='53074' title='53074'>On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and the left - both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours. </span>
<span sid='53075' title='53075'>These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold mine. </span>
<span sid='53076' title='53076'>Naturally, it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value; but, unfortunately, I had no capital by which I could do this. </span>
<span sid='53077' title='53077'>I took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit, and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields. </span>
<span sid='53078' title='53078'>This we have now been doing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. </span>
<span sid='53079' title='53079'>This press, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the subject. </span>
<span sid='53080' title='53080'>We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans. </span>
<span sid='53081' title='53081'>That is why I have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford to-night. </span>
<span sid='53082' title='53082'>I hope that I make it all plain?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='53083' title='53083'>'"I quite follow you," said I. </span>
<span sid='53084' title='53084'>"The only point which I could not quite understand, was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fuller's earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like gravel from a pit."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53085' title='53085'>'"Ah!" said he carelessly, "we have our own process. </span>
<span sid='53086' title='53086'>We compress the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they are. </span>
<span sid='53087' title='53087'>But that is a mere detail. </span>
<span sid='53088' title='53088'>I have taken you fully into my confidence now, Mr Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you." </span>
<span sid='53089' title='53089'>He rose as he spoke. </span>
<span sid='53090' title='53090'>"I shall expect you, then, at Eyford, at 11.15."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53091' title='53091'>'"I shall certainly be there."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53092' title='53092'>'"And not a word to a soul." </span>
<span sid='53093' title='53093'>He looked at me with a last long, questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he hurried from the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53094' title='53094'>'Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had been entrusted to me. </span>
<span sid='53095' title='53095'>On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price upon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones. </span>
<span sid='53096' title='53096'>On the other hand, the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that his explanation of the fuller's earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell anyone of my errand. </span>
<span sid='53097' title='53097'>However, I threw all my fears to the winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off, having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53098' title='53098'>'At <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Reading&t=h'>Reading</a> I had to change not only my carriage but my station. </span>
<span sid='53099' title='53099'>However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o'clock. </span>
<span sid='53100' title='53100'>I was the only passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern. </span>
<span sid='53101' title='53101'>As I passed out through the wicket-gate, however, I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. </span>
<span sid='53102' title='53102'>Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door of which was standing open. </span>
<span sid='53103' title='53103'>He drew up the windows on either side, tapped on the woodwork, and away we went as hard as the horse could go.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53104' title='53104'>'One horse?' interjected Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53105' title='53105'>'Yes, only one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53106' title='53106'>'Did you observe the colour?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53107' title='53107'>'Yes, I saw it by the sidelights when I was stepping into the carriage. </span>
<span sid='53108' title='53108'>It was a chestnut.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53109' title='53109'>'Tired-looking or fresh?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53110' title='53110'>'Oh, fresh and glossy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53111' title='53111'>'Thank you. </span>
<span sid='53112' title='53112'>I am sorry to have interrupted you. </span>
<span sid='53113' title='53113'>Pray continue your most interesting statement.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53114' title='53114'>'Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. </span>
<span sid='53115' title='53115'>Colonel Lysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and the time we took, that it must have been nearer twelve. </span>
<span sid='53116' title='53116'>He sat at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me with great intensity. </span>
<span sid='53117' title='53117'>The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. </span>
<span sid='53118' title='53118'>I tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out nothing save an occasional blur of a passing light. </span>
<span sid='53119' title='53119'>Now and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but the Colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon flagged. </span>
<span sid='53120' title='53120'>At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel drive and the carriage came to a stand. </span>
<span sid='53121' title='53121'>Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. </span>
<span sid='53122' title='53122'>We stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. </span>
<span sid='53123' title='53123'>The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53124' title='53124'>'It was pitch dark inside the house, and the Colonel  fumbled about looking for matches, and muttering under his breath. </span>
<span sid='53125' title='53125'>Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction. </span>
<span sid='53126' title='53126'>It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us. </span>
<span sid='53127' title='53127'>I could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material. </span>
<span sid='53128' title='53128'>She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand. </span>
<span sid='53129' title='53129'>Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53130' title='53130'>'"Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes," said he, throwing open another door. </span>
<span sid='53131' title='53131'>It was a quiet little plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which several German books were scattered. </span>
<span sid='53132' title='53132'>Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door. </span>
<span sid='53133' title='53133'>"I shall not keep you waiting an instant," said he, and vanished into the darkness.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53134' title='53134'>'I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the others being volumes of poetry. </span>
<span sid='53135' title='53135'>Then I walked across to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. </span>
<span sid='53136' title='53136'>It was a wonderfully silent house. </span>
<span sid='53137' title='53137'>There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. </span>
<span sid='53138' title='53138'>A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me. </span>
<span sid='53139' title='53139'>Who were these German people, and what were they doing, living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? </span>
<span sid='53140' title='53140'>And where was the place? </span>
<span sid='53141' title='53141'>I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west, I had no idea. </span>
<span sid='53142' title='53142'>For that matter, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Reading&t=h'>Reading</a>, and possibly other large towns, were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded after all. </span>
<span sid='53143' title='53143'>Yet it was quite certain from the absolute stillness that we were in the country. </span>
<span sid='53144' title='53144'>I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits, and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my fifty- guinea fee.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53145' title='53145'>'Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. </span>
<span sid='53146' title='53146'>The woman was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. </span>
<span sid='53147' title='53147'>I could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. </span>
<span sid='53148' title='53148'>She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53149' title='53149'>'"I would go," said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak calmly; "I would go. </span>
<span sid='53150' title='53150'>I should not stay here. </span>
<span sid='53151' title='53151'>There is no good for you to do."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53152' title='53152'>'"But, madam," said I, "I have not yet done what I came for. </span>
<span sid='53153' title='53153'>I cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53154' title='53154'>'"It is not worth your while to wait," she went on. </span>
<span sid='53155' title='53155'>"You can pass through the door; no one hinders." </span>
<span sid='53156' title='53156'>And then, seeing that I smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint, and made a step forward, with her hands wrung together. </span>
<span sid='53157' title='53157'>"For the love of Heaven!" she whispered, "get away from here before it is too late!"</span>
<p>
<span sid='53158' title='53158'>'But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. </span>
<span sid='53159' title='53159'>I thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. </span>
<span sid='53160' title='53160'>Was it all to go for nothing? </span>
<span sid='53161' title='53161'>Why should I slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? </span>
<span sid='53162' title='53162'>This woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. </span>
<span sid='53163' title='53163'>With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head, and declared my intention of remaining where I was. </span>
<span sid='53164' title='53164'>She was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs. </span>
<span sid='53165' title='53165'>She listened for an instant, threw up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and noiselessly as she had come.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53166' title='53166'>'The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark, and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was introduced to me as Mr Ferguson.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53167' title='53167'>"This is my secretary and manager," said the Colonel. </span>
<span sid='53168' title='53168'>"By the way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just now. </span>
<span sid='53169' title='53169'>I fear that you have felt the draught."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53170' title='53170'>'"On the contrary," said I, "I opened the door myself, because I felt the room to be a little close."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53171' title='53171'>'He shot one of his suspicious glances at me. </span>
<span sid='53172' title='53172'>"Perhaps we had better proceed to business, then," said he. </span>
<span sid='53173' title='53173'>"Mr Ferguson and I will take you up to see the machine."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53174' title='53174'>'"I had better put my hat on, I suppose."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53175' title='53175'>'"Oh no, it is in the house."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53176' title='53176'>'"What, do you dig fuller's earth in the house?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='53177' title='53177'>'"No, no. </span>
<span sid='53178' title='53178'>This is only where we compress it. </span>
<span sid='53179' title='53179'>But never mind that! </span>
<span sid='53180' title='53180'>All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53181' title='53181'>'We went upstairs together, the Colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager and I behind him. </span>
<span sid='53182' title='53182'>It was a labyrinth of an old house, with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them. </span>
<span sid='53183' title='53183'>There were no carpets, and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. </span>
<span sid='53184' title='53184'>I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions. </span>
<span sid='53185' title='53185'>Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53186' title='53186'>'Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he unlocked. </span>
<span sid='53187' title='53187'>Within was a small square room, in which the three of us could hardly get at one time. </span>
<span sid='53188' title='53188'>Ferguson remained outside, and the Colonel ushered me in.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53189' title='53189'>'"We are now," said he, "actually within the hydraulic press, and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on. </span>
<span sid='53190' title='53190'>The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor. </span>
<span sid='53191' title='53191'>There are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. </span>
<span sid='53192' title='53192'>The machine goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working of it and it has lost a little of its force. </span>
<span sid='53193' title='53193'>Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over, and to show us how we can set it right."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53194' title='53194'>'I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly. </span>
<span sid='53195' title='53195'>It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous pressure. </span>
<span sid='53196' title='53196'>When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight  leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. </span>
<span sid='53197' title='53197'>An examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving- rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. </span>
<span sid='53198' title='53198'>This was clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who followed my remarks very carefully, and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. </span>
<span sid='53199' title='53199'>When I had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the machine, and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. </span>
<span sid='53200' title='53200'>It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller's earth was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. </span>
<span sid='53201' title='53201'>The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. </span>
<span sid='53202' title='53202'>I had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was, when I heard a muttered exclamation in German, and saw the cadaverous face of the Colonel looking down at me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53203' title='53203'>'"What are you doing there?" he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53204' title='53204'>'I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me. </span>
<span sid='53205' title='53205'>"I was admiring your fuller's earth," said I; "I think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53206' title='53206'>'The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my speech. </span>
<span sid='53207' title='53207'>His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53208' title='53208'>'Very well," said he, "you shall know all about the machine." </span>
<span sid='53209' title='53209'>He took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the lock. </span>
<span sid='53210' title='53210'>I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. </span>
<span sid='53211' title='53211'>"Hallo!" I yelled. </span>
<span sid='53212' title='53212'>"Hallo! </span>
<span sid='53213' title='53213'>Colonel! </span>
<span sid='53214' title='53214'>Let me out!"</span>
<p>
<span sid='53215' title='53215'>'And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth. </span>
<span sid='53216' title='53216'>It was the clank of the levers, and the swish of the leaking cylinder. </span>
<span sid='53217' title='53217'>He had set the engine at work. </span>
<span sid='53218' title='53218'>The lamp still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. </span>
<span sid='53219' title='53219'>By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. </span>
<span sid='53220' title='53220'>I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. </span>
<span sid='53221' title='53221'>I implored the Colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries. </span>
<span sid='53222' title='53222'>The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. </span>
<span sid='53223' title='53223'>Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I met it. </span>
<span sid='53224' title='53224'>If I lay on my face the weight would come upon spine, and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap. </span>
<span sid='53225' title='53225'>Easier the other way, perhaps, and yet had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me? </span>
<span sid='53226' title='53226'>Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53227' title='53227'>'I have said that though floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls were of wood. </span>
<span sid='53228' title='53228'>As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backwards. </span>
<span sid='53229' title='53229'>For an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death. </span>
<span sid='53230' title='53230'>The next I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. </span>
<span sid='53231' title='53231'>The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had been my escape.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53232' title='53232'>'I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held a candle in her right. </span>
<span sid='53233' title='53233'>It was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53234' title='53234'>'"Come! </span>
<span sid='53235' title='53235'>Come!" she cried, breathlessly. </span>
<span sid='53236' title='53236'>"They will be here in a moment. </span>
<span sid='53237' title='53237'>They will see that you are not there. </span>
<span sid='53238' title='53238'>Oh, do not waste the so precious time, but come!"</span>
<p>
<span sid='53239' title='53239'>'This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. </span>
<span sid='53240' title='53240'>I staggered to my feet, and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. </span>
<span sid='53241' title='53241'>The latter led to another broad passage, and, just as we reached it, we heard the sound of running feet, and the shouting of two voices - one answering the other - from the floor on which we were, and from the one beneath. </span>
<span sid='53242' title='53242'>My guide stopped, and looked about her like one who is at her wits' end. </span>
<span sid='53243' title='53243'>Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon was shining brightly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53244' title='53244'>'"It is your only chance," said she. </span>
<span sid='53245' title='53245'>"It is high, but it may be that you can jump it."</span>
<p>
<span sid='53246' title='53246'>'As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand, and a weapon like a butcher's cleaver in the other. </span>
<span sid='53247' title='53247'>I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out. </span>
<span sid='53248' title='53248'>How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet down. </span>
<span sid='53249' title='53249'>I clambered out upon the sill, but hesitated to jump, until I should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me. </span>
<span sid='53250' title='53250'>If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance. </span>
<span sid='53251' title='53251'>The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round him, and tried to hold him back.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53252' title='53252'>'"Fritz! </span>
<span sid='53253' title='53253'>Fritz!" she cried in English, "remember your promise after the last time. </span>
<span sid='53254' title='53254'>You said it should not be again. </span>
<span sid='53255' title='53255'>He will be silent! </span>
<span sid='53256' title='53256'>Oh, he will be silent!"</span>
<p>
<span sid='53257' title='53257'>'"You are mad, Elise!" he shouted, struggling to break away from her. </span>
<span sid='53258' title='53258'>"You will be the ruin of us. </span>
<span sid='53259' title='53259'>He has seen too much. </span>
<span sid='53260' title='53260'>Let me pass, I say!" </span>
<span sid='53261' title='53261'>He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with his heavy weapon. </span>
<span sid='53262' title='53262'>I had let myself go, and was hanging with my fingers in the window slot and my hands across the sill, when his blow fell. </span>
<span sid='53263' title='53263'>I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the garden below.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53264' title='53264'>'I was shaken, but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood that I was far from being out of danger yet. </span>
<span sid='53265' title='53265'>Suddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. </span>
<span sid='53266' title='53266'>I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off, and that the blood was pouring from my wound. </span>
<span sid='53267' title='53267'>I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53268' title='53268'>'How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. </span>
<span sid='53269' title='53269'>It must have been a very long time, for the moon had sunk and a bright morning was breaking when I came to myself My clothes were all sodden with dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. </span>
<span sid='53270' title='53270'>The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night's adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. </span>
<span sid='53271' title='53271'>But, to my astonishment, when I came to look round me neither house nor garden were to be seen. </span>
<span sid='53272' title='53272'>I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad, and just a little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night. </span>
<span sid='53273' title='53273'>Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53274' title='53274'>'Half dazed, I went into the station, and asked about the morning train. </span>
<span sid='53275' title='53275'>There would be one to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Reading&t=h'>Reading</a> in less than an hour. </span>
<span sid='53276' title='53276'>The same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. </span>
<span sid='53277' title='53277'>I inquired from him whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. </span>
<span sid='53278' title='53278'>The name was strange to him. </span>
<span sid='53279' title='53279'>Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me? </span>
<span sid='53280' title='53280'>No, he had not. </span>
<span sid='53281' title='53281'>Was there a police station anywhere near? </span>
<span sid='53282' title='53282'>There was one about three miles off.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53283' title='53283'>It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. </span>
<span sid='53284' title='53284'>I determined to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police. </span>
<span sid='53285' title='53285'>It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. </span>
<span sid='53286' title='53286'>I put the case into your hands, and shall do exactly what you advise.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53287' title='53287'>We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative. </span>
<span sid='53288' title='53288'>Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53289' title='53289'>'Here is an advertisement which will interest you,' said he. </span>
<span sid='53290' title='53290'>'It appeared in all the papers about a year ago. </span>
<span sid='53291' title='53291'>Listen to this - "Lost on the 9th inst., Mr Jeremiah Hayling, aged 26, a hydraulic engineer. </span>
<span sid='53292' title='53292'>Left his lodgings at ten o'clock at night, and has riot been heard of since. </span>
<span sid='53293' title='53293'>Was dressed in," etc. etc. </span>
<span sid='53294' title='53294'>Ha! </span>
<span sid='53295' title='53295'>That represents the last time that the Colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53296' title='53296'>'Good heavens!' cried my patient. </span>
<span sid='53297' title='53297'>'Then that explains what the girl said.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53298' title='53298'>'Undoubtedly. </span>
<span sid='53299' title='53299'>It is quite clear that the Colonel was a cool and desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship. </span>
<span sid='53300' title='53300'>Well, every moment now is precious, so, if you feel equal to it, we shall go down to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a> at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53301' title='53301'>Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together, bound from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Reading&t=h'>Reading</a> to the little <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Berkshire&t=h'>Berkshire</a> village. </span>
<span sid='53302' title='53302'>There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>, a plain-clothes man, and myself. </span>
<span sid='53303' title='53303'>Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat, and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53304' title='53304'>'There you are,' said he. </span>
<span sid='53305' title='53305'>'That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village. </span>
<span sid='53306' title='53306'>The place we want must be somewhere near that line. </span>
<span sid='53307' title='53307'>You said ten miles, I think, sir?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53308' title='53308'>'It was an hour's good drive.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53309' title='53309'>'And you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53310' title='53310'>'They must have done so. </span>
<span sid='53311' title='53311'>I have a confused memory, too, of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53312' title='53312'>'What I cannot understand,' said I, 'is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden. </span>
<span sid='53313' title='53313'>Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman's entreaties.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53314' title='53314'>'I hardly think that likely. </span>
<span sid='53315' title='53315'>I never saw a more inexorable face in my life.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53316' title='53316'>'Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,' said Bradstreet. </span>
<span sid='53317' title='53317'>'Well, I have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53318' title='53318'>'I think I could lay my finger on it,' said Holmes quietly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53319' title='53319'>'Really, now!' cried the inspector, 'you have formed your opinion! </span>
<span sid='53320' title='53320'>Come now, we shall see who agrees with you. </span>
<span sid='53321' title='53321'>I say south, for the country is more deserted there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53322' title='53322'>'And I say east,' said my patient.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53323' title='53323'>'I am for west,' remarked the plain-clothes man. </span>
<span sid='53324' title='53324'>'There are several quiet little villages up there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53325' title='53325'>'And I am for north,' said I; 'because there are no hills there, and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53326' title='53326'>'Come,' said the inspector, laughing; 'it's a very pretty diversity of opinion. </span>
<span sid='53327' title='53327'>We have boxed the compass among us. </span>
<span sid='53328' title='53328'>Who do you give your casting vote to?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53329' title='53329'>'You are all wrong.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53330' title='53330'>'But we can't all be.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53331' title='53331'>'Oh, yes, you can. </span>
<span sid='53332' title='53332'>This is my point,' he placed his finger on the centre of the circle. </span>
<span sid='53333' title='53333'>'This is where we shall find them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53334' title='53334'>'But the twelve-mile drive?' gasped Hatherley.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53335' title='53335'>'Six out and six back. </span>
<span sid='53336' title='53336'>Nothing simpler. </span>
<span sid='53337' title='53337'>You say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. </span>
<span sid='53338' title='53338'>How could it be that, if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53339' title='53339'>'Indeed it is a likely ruse enough,' observed Bradstreet thoughtfully. </span>
<span sid='53340' title='53340'>'Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53341' title='53341'>'None at all,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='53342' title='53342'>'They are coiners on a large scale, and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver:</span>
<p>
<span sid='53343' title='53343'>'We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,' said the inspector. </span>
<span sid='53344' title='53344'>'They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. </span>
<span sid='53345' title='53345'>We even traced them as far as <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Reading&t=h'>Reading</a>, but could get no further; for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands. </span>
<span sid='53346' title='53346'>But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53347' title='53347'>But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice. </span>
<span sid='53348' title='53348'>As we rolled into Eyford station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood, and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53349' title='53349'>'A house on fire?' asked Bradstreet, as the train steamed off again on its way.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53350' title='53350'>'Yes, sir,' said the station-master.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53351' title='53351'>'When did it break out?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53352' title='53352'>'I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and the whole place is in a blaze.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53353' title='53353'>'Whose house is it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53354' title='53354'>'Dr Becher's.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53355' title='53355'>'Tell me,' broke in the engineer, 'is Dr Becher a German, very thin, with a long sharp nose?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53356' title='53356'>The station-master laughed heartily. </span>
<span sid='53357' title='53357'>'No, sir, Dr Becher is an Englishman, and there isn't a man in the parish who has a better-lined waistcoat. </span>
<span sid='53358' title='53358'>But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Berkshire&t=h'>Berkshire</a> beef would do him no harm.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53359' title='53359'>The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire. </span>
<span sid='53360' title='53360'>The road topped a low hill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53361' title='53361'>'That's it!' cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. </span>
<span sid='53362' title='53362'>'There is the gravel drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. </span>
<span sid='53363' title='53363'>That second window is the one that I jumped from.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53364' title='53364'>'Well, at least,' said Holmes, 'you have had your revenge upon them. </span>
<span sid='53365' title='53365'>There can be no question that it was your oil lamp which, when it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no ,doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time. </span>
<span sid='53366' title='53366'>Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night, though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53367' title='53367'>And Holmes's fears came to be realized, for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or the morose Englishman. </span>
<span sid='53368' title='53368'>Early that morning a peasant had met a cart, containing several people and some very bulky boxes, driving rapidly in the direction of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Reading&t=h'>Reading</a>, but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes's ingenuity failed to discover the least clue to their whereabouts.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53369' title='53369'>The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a windowsill of the second floor. </span>
<span sid='53370' title='53370'>About sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. </span>
<span sid='53371' title='53371'>Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an outhouse, but no coins were to be found, which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53372' title='53372'>How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained for ever a mystery were it not for the soft mould which told us a very plain tale. </span>
<span sid='53373' title='53373'>He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet, and the other unusually large ones. </span>
<span sid='53374' title='53374'>On the whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger.</span>
<p>
<span sid='53375' title='53375'>'Well,' said our engineer ruefully, as we took our seats to return to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, 'it has been a pretty business for me! </span>
<span sid='53376' title='53376'>I have lost my thumb, and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='53377' title='53377'>'Experience,' said Holmes, laughing. </span>
<span sid='53378' title='53378'>'Indirectly it may be of value, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence.'</span>
