<h1><span sid='44528' title='44528'>The Adventure of the Three Students</span></h1>
<p class="subtitle">Arthur Conan Doyle<label for="sn-meta-3stu" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-meta-3stu" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><!--googleoff: all--><b>Story Number</b>: 36<br><b>Published in</b>: The Strand Magazine in June 1904<br><b>Collected in</b>: The Return of Sherlock Holmes<!--googleon: all--></span></p>
<p>
<span sid='44529' title='44529'>It was in the year '95 that a combination of events, into which I need not enter, caused Mr Sherlock Holmes and myself to spend some weeks in one of our great University towns, and it was during this time that the small but instructive adventure which I am about to relate befell us. </span>
<span sid='44530' title='44530'>It will be obvious that any details which would help the reader to exactly identify the college or the criminal would be injudicious and offensive. </span>
<span sid='44531' title='44531'>So painful a scandal may well be allowed to die out. </span>
<span sid='44532' title='44532'>With due discretion the incident itself may, however, be described, since it serves to illustrate some of those qualities for which my friend was remarkable. </span>
<span sid='44533' title='44533'>I will endeavour in my statement to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place, or give a clue as to the people concerned.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44534' title='44534'>We were residing at the time in furnished lodgings close to a library where Sherlock Holmes was pursuing some laborious researches in early English charters - researches which led to results so striking that they may be the subject of one of my future narratives. </span>
<span sid='44535' title='44535'>Here it was that one evening we received a visit from an acquaintance, Mr Hilton Soames, tutor and lecturer at the College of St Luke's. </span>
<span sid='44536' title='44536'>Mr Soames was a tall, spare man, of a nervous and excitable temperament. </span>
<span sid='44537' title='44537'>I had always known him to be restless in his manner, but on this particular occasion he was in such a state of uncontrollable agitation that it was clear something very unusual had occurred.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44538' title='44538'>'I trust, Mr Holmes, that you can spare me a few hours of your valuable time. </span>
<span sid='44539' title='44539'>We have had a very painful incident at St Luke's, and really, but for the happy chance of your being in the town, I should have been at a loss what to do.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44540' title='44540'>'I am very busy just now, and I desire no distractions,' my friend answered. </span>
<span sid='44541' title='44541'>'I should much prefer that you called in the aid of the police.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44542' title='44542'>'No, no, my dear sir; such a course is utterly impossible. </span>
<span sid='44543' title='44543'>When once the law is evoked it cannot be stayed again, and this is just one of those cases where, for the credit of the college, it is most essential to avoid scandal. </span>
<span sid='44544' title='44544'>Your discretion is as well known as your powers, and you are the one man in the world who can help me. </span>
<span sid='44545' title='44545'>I beg you, Mr Holmes, to do what you can.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44546' title='44546'>My friend's temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='44547' title='44547'>Without his scrap-books, his chemicals, and his homely untidiness, he was an uncomfortable man. </span>
<span sid='44548' title='44548'>He shrugged his shoulders in ungracious acquiescence, while our visitor in hurried words and with much excitable gesticulation poured forth his story.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44549' title='44549'>'I must explain to you, Mr Holmes, that to-morrow is the first day of the examination for the Fortescue Scholarship. </span>
<span sid='44550' title='44550'>I am one of the examiners. </span>
<span sid='44551' title='44551'>My subject is Greek, and the first of the papers consists of a large passage of Greek translation which the candidate has not seen. </span>
<span sid='44552' title='44552'>This passage is printed on the examination paper, and it would naturally be an immense advantage if the candidate could prepare it in advance. </span>
<span sid='44553' title='44553'>For this reason great care is taken to keep the paper secret.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44554' title='44554'>'To-day about three o'clock the proofs of this paper arrived from the printers. </span>
<span sid='44555' title='44555'>The exercise consists of half a chapter of Thucydides. </span>
<span sid='44556' title='44556'>I had to read it over carefully, as the text must be absolutely correct. </span>
<span sid='44557' title='44557'>At four-thirty my task was not yet completed. </span>
<span sid='44558' title='44558'>I had, however, promised to take tea in a friend's rooms, so I left the proof upon my desk. </span>
<span sid='44559' title='44559'>I was absent rather more than an hour. </span>
<span sid='44560' title='44560'>You are aware, Mr Holmes, that our college doors are double - a green baize one within and a heavy oak one without. </span>
<span sid='44561' title='44561'>As I approached my outer door I was amazed to see a key in it. </span>
<span sid='44562' title='44562'>For an instant I imagined that I had left my own there, but on feeling in my pocket I found that it was all right. </span>
<span sid='44563' title='44563'>The only duplicate which existed, so far as I knew, was that which belonged to my servant, Bannister, a man who has looked after my room for ten years, and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion. </span>
<span sid='44564' title='44564'>I found that the key was indeed his, that he had entered my room to know if I wanted tea, and that he had very carelessly left the key in the door when he came out. </span>
<span sid='44565' title='44565'>His visit to my room must have been within a very few minutes of my leaving it. </span>
<span sid='44566' title='44566'>His forgetfulness about the key would have mattered little upon any other occasion, but on this one day it has produced the most deplorable consequences.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44567' title='44567'>'The moment I looked at my table I was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers. </span>
<span sid='44568' title='44568'>The proof was in three long slips. </span>
<span sid='44569' title='44569'>I had left them all together. </span>
<span sid='44570' title='44570'>Now I found that one of them was lying on the floor, one was on the side-table near the window, and the third was where I had left it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44571' title='44571'>Holmes stirred for the first time.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44572' title='44572'>'The first page on the floor, the second in the window, and the third where you left it,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44573' title='44573'>'Exactly, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='44574' title='44574'>You amaze me. </span>
<span sid='44575' title='44575'>How could you possibly know that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44576' title='44576'>'Pray continue your very interesting statement.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44577' title='44577'>'For an instant I imagined that Bannister had taken the unpardonable liberty of examining my papers. </span>
<span sid='44578' title='44578'>He denied it, however, with the utmost earnestness, and I am convinced that he was speaking the truth. </span>
<span sid='44579' title='44579'>The alternative was that someone passing had observed the key in the door, had known that I was out, and had entered to look at the papers. </span>
<span sid='44580' title='44580'>A large sum of money is at stake, for the scholarship is a very valuable one, and an unscrupulous man might very well run a risk in order to gain advantage over his fellows.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44581' title='44581'>'Bannister was very much upset by the incident. </span>
<span sid='44582' title='44582'>He had nearly fainted when we found that the papers had undoubtedly been tampered with. </span>
<span sid='44583' title='44583'>I gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair while I made a most careful examination of the room. </span>
<span sid='44584' title='44584'>I soon saw that the intruder had left other traces of his presence besides the rumpled papers. </span>
<span sid='44585' title='44585'>On the table in the window were several shreds from a pencil which had been sharpened. </span>
<span sid='44586' title='44586'>A broken tip of lead was lying there also. </span>
<span sid='44587' title='44587'>Evidently the rascal had copied the paper in a great hurry, had broken his pencil, and had been compelled to put a fresh point to it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44588' title='44588'>'Excellent!' said Holmes, who was recovering his good humour as his attention became more engrossed by the case. </span>
<span sid='44589' title='44589'>'Fortune has been your friend.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44590' title='44590'>'This was not all I have a new writing-table with a fine surface of red leather. </span>
<span sid='44591' title='44591'>I am prepared to swear, and so is Bannister, that it was smooth and unstained. </span>
<span sid='44592' title='44592'>Now I found a clean cut in it about three inches long - not a mere scratch, but a positive cut. </span>
<span sid='44593' title='44593'>Not only this, but on the table I found a small ball of black dough, or clay, with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it. </span>
<span sid='44594' title='44594'>I am convinced that these marks were left by the man who rifled the papers. </span>
<span sid='44595' title='44595'>There were no footmarks and no other evidence as to his identity. </span>
<span sid='44596' title='44596'>I was at my wits' end, when suddenly the happy thought occurred to me that you were in the town, and I came straight round to put the matter into your hands. </span>
<span sid='44597' title='44597'>Do help me, Mr Holmes! </span>
<span sid='44598' title='44598'>You see my dilemma. </span>
<span sid='44599' title='44599'>Either I must find the man, or else the examination must be postponed until fresh papers are prepared, and since this cannot be done without explanation, there will ensue a hideous scandal, which will throw a cloud not only on the college but on the University. </span>
<span sid='44600' title='44600'>Above all things, I desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44601' title='44601'>'I shall be happy to look into it and to give you such advice as I can,' said Holmes, rising and putting on his overcoat. </span>
<span sid='44602' title='44602'>'This case is not entirely devoid of interest. </span>
<span sid='44603' title='44603'>Has anyone visited you in your room after the papers came to you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44604' title='44604'>'Yes, young Daulat Ras, an Indian student who lives on the same stair, came in to ask me some particulars about the examination.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44605' title='44605'>'For which he was entered?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44606' title='44606'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44607' title='44607'>'And the papers were on your table?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44608' title='44608'>'To the best of my belief they were rolled up.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44609' title='44609'>'But might be recognized as proofs?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44610' title='44610'>'Possibly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44611' title='44611'>'No one else in your room?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44612' title='44612'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44613' title='44613'>'Did anyone know that these proofs would be there?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44614' title='44614'>'No one save the printer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44615' title='44615'>'Did this man Bannister know?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44616' title='44616'>'No, certainly not. </span>
<span sid='44617' title='44617'>No one knew.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44618' title='44618'>'Where is Bannister now?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44619' title='44619'>'He was very ill, poor fellow! </span>
<span sid='44620' title='44620'>I left him collapsed in the chair. </span>
<span sid='44621' title='44621'>I was in such a hurry to come to you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44622' title='44622'>'You left your door open?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44623' title='44623'>'I locked the papers up first.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44624' title='44624'>'Then it amounts to this, Mr Soames, that unless the Indian student recognized the roll as being proofs, the man who tampered with them came upon them accidentally without knowing that they were there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44625' title='44625'>'So it seems to me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44626' title='44626'>Holmes gave an enigmatic smile.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44627' title='44627'>'Well,' said he, let us go round. </span>
<span sid='44628' title='44628'>Not one of your cases, Watson - mental, not physical. </span>
<span sid='44629' title='44629'>All right; come if you want to. </span>
<span sid='44630' title='44630'>Now, Mr Soames - at your disposal!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44631' title='44631'>The sitting-room of our client opened by a long, low, latticed window on to the ancient lichen-tinted court of the old college. </span>
<span sid='44632' title='44632'>A Gothic arched door led to a worn stone staircase. </span>
<span sid='44633' title='44633'>On the ground floor was the tutor's room. </span>
<span sid='44634' title='44634'>Above were three students, one on each storey. </span>
<span sid='44635' title='44635'>It was already twilight when we reached the scene of our problem. </span>
<span sid='44636' title='44636'>Holmes halted and looked earnestly at the window. </span>
<span sid='44637' title='44637'>Then he approached it, and, standing on tiptoe, with his neck craned, he looked into the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44638' title='44638'>'He must have entered through the door. </span>
<span sid='44639' title='44639'>There is no opening except the one pane,' said our learned guide.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44640' title='44640'>'Dear me!' said Holmes, and he smiled in a singular way as he glanced at our companion. </span>
<span sid='44641' title='44641'>'Well, if there is nothing to be learned here we had best go inside.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44642' title='44642'>The lecturer unlocked the outer door and ushered us into his room. </span>
<span sid='44643' title='44643'>We stood at the entrance while Holmes made an examination of the carpet.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44644' title='44644'>'I am afraid there are no signs here,' said he. </span>
<span sid='44645' title='44645'>'One could hardly hope for any upon so dry a day. </span>
<span sid='44646' title='44646'>Your servant seems to have quite recovered. </span>
<span sid='44647' title='44647'>You left him in a chair, you say; which chair?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44648' title='44648'>'By the window there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44649' title='44649'>'I see. </span>
<span sid='44650' title='44650'>Near this little table. </span>
<span sid='44651' title='44651'>You can come in now. </span>
<span sid='44652' title='44652'>I have finished with the carpet. </span>
<span sid='44653' title='44653'>Let us take the little table first. </span>
<span sid='44654' title='44654'>Of course, what has happened is very clear. </span>
<span sid='44655' title='44655'>The man entered and took the papers, sheet by sheet, from the central table. </span>
<span sid='44656' title='44656'>He carried them over to the window table, because from there he could see if you came across the courtyard, and so could effect an escape.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44657' title='44657'>'As a matter of fact, he could not,' said Soames, 'for I entered by the side-door.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44658' title='44658'>'Ah, that's good! </span>
<span sid='44659' title='44659'>Well, anyhow, that was in his mind. </span>
<span sid='44660' title='44660'>Let me see the three strips. </span>
<span sid='44661' title='44661'>No finger impressions - no! </span>
<span sid='44662' title='44662'>Well, he carried over this one first and he copied it. </span>
<span sid='44663' title='44663'>How long would it take him to do that, using every possible contraction? </span>
<span sid='44664' title='44664'>A quarter of an hour, not less. </span>
<span sid='44665' title='44665'>Then he tossed it down and seized the next. </span>
<span sid='44666' title='44666'>He was in the midst of that when your return caused him to make a very hurried retreat - very hurried, since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there. </span>
<span sid='44667' title='44667'>You were not aware of any hurrying feet on the stair as you entered the outer door?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44668' title='44668'>'No, I can't say I was.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44669' title='44669'>'Well, he wrote so furiously that he broke his pencil, and had, as you observe, to sharpen it again. </span>
<span sid='44670' title='44670'>This is of interest, Watson. </span>
<span sid='44671' title='44671'>The pencil was not an ordinary one. </span>
<span sid='44672' title='44672'>It was above the usual size with a soft lead; the outer colour was dark blue, the maker's name was printed in silver lettering, and the piece remaining is only about an inch and a half long. </span>
<span sid='44673' title='44673'>Look for such a pencil, Mr Soames, and you have got your man. </span>
<span sid='44674' title='44674'>When I add that he possesses a large and very blunt knife, you have an additional aid.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44675' title='44675'>Mr Soames was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information. </span>
<span sid='44676' title='44676'>'I can follow the other points,' said he, 'but really in this matter of the length - '</span>
<p>
<span sid='44677' title='44677'>Holmes held out a small chip with the letters NN and a space of clear wood after them.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44678' title='44678'>'You see?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44679' title='44679'>'No, I fear that even now-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44680' title='44680'>'Watson, I have always done you an injustice. </span>
<span sid='44681' title='44681'>There are others. </span>
<span sid='44682' title='44682'>What could this NN be? </span>
<span sid='44683' title='44683'>It is at the end of a word. </span>
<span sid='44684' title='44684'>You are aware that Johann Faber is the most common maker's name. </span>
<span sid='44685' title='44685'>Is it not clear that there is just as much of the pencil left as usually follows the Johann?' </span>
<span sid='44686' title='44686'>He held the small table sideways to the electric light. </span>
<span sid='44687' title='44687'>'I was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface. </span>
<span sid='44688' title='44688'>No, I see nothing. </span>
<span sid='44689' title='44689'>I don't think there is anything more to be learned here. </span>
<span sid='44690' title='44690'>Now for the central table. </span>
<span sid='44691' title='44691'>This small pellet is, I presume, the black doughy mass you spoke of. </span>
<span sid='44692' title='44692'>Roughly pyramidal in shape and hollowed out, I perceive. </span>
<span sid='44693' title='44693'>As you say, there appear to be grains of sawdust in it. </span>
<span sid='44694' title='44694'>Dear me, this is very interesting. </span>
<span sid='44695' title='44695'>And the cut - a positive tear, I see. </span>
<span sid='44696' title='44696'>It began with a thin scratch and ended in a jagged hole. </span>
<span sid='44697' title='44697'>I am much indebted to you for directing my attention to this case, Mr Soames. </span>
<span sid='44698' title='44698'>Where does that door lead to?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44699' title='44699'>'To my bedroom.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44700' title='44700'>'Have you been in it since your adventure?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44701' title='44701'>'No; I came straight away for you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44702' title='44702'>'I should like to have a glance round. </span>
<span sid='44703' title='44703'>What a charming, old-fashioned room! </span>
<span sid='44704' title='44704'>Perhaps you will kindly wait a minute until I have examined the floor. </span>
<span sid='44705' title='44705'>No, I see nothing. </span>
<span sid='44706' title='44706'>What about this curtain? </span>
<span sid='44707' title='44707'>You hang your clothes behind it. </span>
<span sid='44708' title='44708'>If anyone were forced to conceal himself in this room he must do it there, since the bed is too low and the wardrobe too shallow. </span>
<span sid='44709' title='44709'>No one there, I suppose?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44710' title='44710'>As Holmes drew the curtain I was aware, from some little rigidity and alertness of his attitude, that he was prepared for an emergency. </span>
<span sid='44711' title='44711'>As a matter of fact the drawn curtain disclosed nothing but three or four suits of clothes hanging from a line of pegs. </span>
<span sid='44712' title='44712'>Holmes turned away, and stooped suddenly to the floor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44713' title='44713'>'Hullo! </span>
<span sid='44714' title='44714'>What's this?' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44715' title='44715'>It was a small pyramid of black, putty-like stuff, exactly like the one upon the table of the study. </span>
<span sid='44716' title='44716'>Holmes held it out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44717' title='44717'>'Your visitor seems to have left traces in your bedroom as well as in your sitting-room, Mr Soames.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44718' title='44718'>'What could he have wanted there?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44719' title='44719'>'I think it is clear enough. </span>
<span sid='44720' title='44720'>You came back by an unexpected way, and so he had no warning until you were at the very door. </span>
<span sid='44721' title='44721'>What could he do? </span>
<span sid='44722' title='44722'>He caught up everything which would betray him, and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44723' title='44723'>'Good gracious, Mr Holmes, do you mean to tell me that all the time I was talking to Bannister in this room we had the man prisoner if we had only known it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44724' title='44724'>'So I read it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44725' title='44725'>'Surely there is another alternative, Mr Holmes? </span>
<span sid='44726' title='44726'>I don't know whether you observed my bedroom window.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44727' title='44727'>'Lattice-paned, lead framework, three separate windows, one swinging on a hinge and large enough to admit a man.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44728' title='44728'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='44729' title='44729'>And it looks out on an angle of the courtyard so as to be partly invisible. </span>
<span sid='44730' title='44730'>The man might have effected his entrance there, left traces as he passed through the bedroom, and, finally, finding the door open, have escaped that way.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44731' title='44731'>Holmes shook his head impatiently.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44732' title='44732'>'Let us be practical,' said he. </span>
<span sid='44733' title='44733'>'I understand you to say that there are three students who use this stair and are in the habit of passing your door?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44734' title='44734'>'Yes, there are.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44735' title='44735'>'And they are all in this examination?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44736' title='44736'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44737' title='44737'>'Have you any reason to suspect any one of them more than the others?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44738' title='44738'>Soames hesitated.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44739' title='44739'>'It is a very delicate question,' said he. </span>
<span sid='44740' title='44740'>'One hardly likes to throw suspicion where there are no proofs.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44741' title='44741'>'Let us hear the suspicions. </span>
<span sid='44742' title='44742'>I will look after the proofs.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44743' title='44743'>'I will tell you, then, in a few words, the character of the three men who inhabit these rooms. </span>
<span sid='44744' title='44744'>The lower of the three is Gilchrist, a fine scholar and athlete; plays in the Rugby team and the cricket team for the college, and got his Blue for the hurdles and the long jump. </span>
<span sid='44745' title='44745'>He is a fine, manly fellow. </span>
<span sid='44746' title='44746'>His father was the notorious Sir Jabez Gilchrist, who ruined himself on the Turf. </span>
<span sid='44747' title='44747'>My scholar has been left very poor, but he is hard-working and industrious. </span>
<span sid='44748' title='44748'>He will do well.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44749' title='44749'>'The second floor is inhabited by Daulat Ras, the Indian. </span>
<span sid='44750' title='44750'>He is a quiet, inscrutable fellow, as most of those Indians are. </span>
<span sid='44751' title='44751'>He is well up in his work, though his Greek is his weak subject. </span>
<span sid='44752' title='44752'>He is steady and methodical.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44753' title='44753'>'The top floor belongs to Miles McLaren. </span>
<span sid='44754' title='44754'>He is a brilliant fellow when he chooses to work - one of the brightest intellects of the University, but he is wayward, dissipated, and unprincipled. </span>
<span sid='44755' title='44755'>He was nearly expelled over a card scandal in his first year. </span>
<span sid='44756' title='44756'>He has been idling all this term, and he must look forward with dread to the examination.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44757' title='44757'>'Then it is he whom you suspect?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44758' title='44758'>'I dare not go so far as that. </span>
<span sid='44759' title='44759'>But of the three he is perhaps the least unlikely.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44760' title='44760'>'Exactly. </span>
<span sid='44761' title='44761'>Now, Mr Soames, let us have a look at your servant, Bannister.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44762' title='44762'>He was a little, white-faced, clean-shaven, grizzly-haired fellow of fifty. </span>
<span sid='44763' title='44763'>He was still suffering from this sudden disturbance of the quiet routine of his life. </span>
<span sid='44764' title='44764'>His plump face was twitching with his nervousness, and his fingers could not keep still.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44765' title='44765'>'We are investigating this unhappy business, Bannister,' said his master.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44766' title='44766'>'Yes, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44767' title='44767'>'I understand,' said Holmes, 'that you left your key in the door?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44768' title='44768'>'Yes, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44769' title='44769'>'Was it not very extraordinary that you should do this on the very day when there were these papers inside?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44770' title='44770'>'It was most unfortunate, sir. </span>
<span sid='44771' title='44771'>But I have occasionally done the same thing at other times.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44772' title='44772'>'When did you enter the room?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44773' title='44773'>'It was about half-past four. </span>
<span sid='44774' title='44774'>That is Mr Soames's teatime.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44775' title='44775'>'How long did you stay?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44776' title='44776'>'When I saw that he was absent I withdrew at once.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44777' title='44777'>'Did you look at these papers on the table?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44778' title='44778'>'No, sir; certainly not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44779' title='44779'>'How came you to leave the key in the door?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44780' title='44780'>'I had the tea-tray in my hand. </span>
<span sid='44781' title='44781'>I thought I would come back for the key. </span>
<span sid='44782' title='44782'>Then I forgot.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44783' title='44783'>'Has the outer door a spring lock?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44784' title='44784'>'No, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44785' title='44785'>'Then it was open all the time?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44786' title='44786'>'Yes, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44787' title='44787'>'Anyone in the room could get out?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44788' title='44788'>'Yes, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44789' title='44789'>'When Mr Soames returned and called for you, you were very much disturbed?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44790' title='44790'>'Yes, sir. </span>
<span sid='44791' title='44791'>Such a thing has never happened during the many years that I have been here. </span>
<span sid='44792' title='44792'>I nearly fainted, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44793' title='44793'>'So I understand. </span>
<span sid='44794' title='44794'>Where were you when you began to feel bad?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44795' title='44795'>'Where was I, sir? </span>
<span sid='44796' title='44796'>Why, here, near the door.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44797' title='44797'>'That is singular, because you sat down in that chair over yonder near the corner. </span>
<span sid='44798' title='44798'>Why did you pass these other chairs?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44799' title='44799'>'I don't know, sir. </span>
<span sid='44800' title='44800'>It didn't matter to me where I sat.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44801' title='44801'>'I really don't think he knew much about it, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='44802' title='44802'>He was looking very bad - quite ghastly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44803' title='44803'>'You stayed here when your master left?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44804' title='44804'>'Only for a minute or so. </span>
<span sid='44805' title='44805'>Then I locked the door and went to my room.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44806' title='44806'>'Whom do you suspect?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44807' title='44807'>'Oh, I would not venture to say, sir. </span>
<span sid='44808' title='44808'>I don't believe there is any gentleman in this University who is capable of profiting by such an action. </span>
<span sid='44809' title='44809'>No, sir, I'll not believe it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44810' title='44810'>'Thank you; that will do,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='44811' title='44811'>'Oh, one more word. </span>
<span sid='44812' title='44812'>You have not mentioned to any of the three gentlemen whom you attend that anything is amiss?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44813' title='44813'>'No, sir; not a word.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44814' title='44814'>'You haven't seen any of them?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44815' title='44815'>'No, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44816' title='44816'>'Very good. </span>
<span sid='44817' title='44817'>Now, Mr Soames, we will take a walk in the quadrangle, if you please.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44818' title='44818'>Three yellow squares of light shone above us in the gathering gloom.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44819' title='44819'>'Your three birds are all in their nests,' said Holmes, looking up. </span>
<span sid='44820' title='44820'>'Hullo! </span>
<span sid='44821' title='44821'>What's that? </span>
<span sid='44822' title='44822'>One of them seems restless enough.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44823' title='44823'>It was the Indian, whose dark silhouette appeared suddenly upon the blind. </span>
<span sid='44824' title='44824'>He was pacing swiftly up and down his room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44825' title='44825'>'I should like to have a peep at each of them,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='44826' title='44826'>'Is it possible?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44827' title='44827'>'No difficulty in the world,' Soames answered. </span>
<span sid='44828' title='44828'>'This set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college, and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them. </span>
<span sid='44829' title='44829'>Come along, and I will personally conduct you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44830' title='44830'>'No names, please!' said Holmes, as we knocked at Gilchrist's door. </span>
<span sid='44831' title='44831'>A tall, flaxen-haired, slim young fellow opened it, and made us welcome when he understood our errand. </span>
<span sid='44832' title='44832'>There were some really curious pieces of medieval domestic architecture within. </span>
<span sid='44833' title='44833'>Holmes was so charmed with one of them that he insisted on drawing it on his notebook, broke his pencil, had to borrow one from our host, and finally borrowed a knife to sharpen his own. </span>
<span sid='44834' title='44834'>The same curious accident happened to him in the rooms of the Indian - a silent, little, hook-nosed fellow, who eyed us askance and was obviously glad when Holmes's architectural studies had come to an end. </span>
<span sid='44835' title='44835'>I could not see that in either case Holmes had come upon the clue for which he was searching. </span>
<span sid='44836' title='44836'>Only at the third did our visit prove abortive. </span>
<span sid='44837' title='44837'>The outer door would not open to our knock, and nothing more substantial than a torrent of bad language came from behind it. </span>
<span sid='44838' title='44838'>'I don't care who you are. </span>
<span sid='44839' title='44839'>You can go to blazes!' roared the angry voice. </span>
<span sid='44840' title='44840'>To-morrow's the exam, and I won't be drawn by anyone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44841' title='44841'>'A rude fellow,' said our guide, flushing with anger as we withdrew down the stair. </span>
<span sid='44842' title='44842'>'Of course, he did not realize that it was I who was knocking, but none the less his conduct was very uncourteous, and, indeed, under the circumstances, rather suspicious.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44843' title='44843'>Holmes's response was a curious one.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44844' title='44844'>'Can you tell me his exact height?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44845' title='44845'>'Really, Mr Holmes, I cannot undertake to say. </span>
<span sid='44846' title='44846'>He is taller than the Indian, not so tall as Gilchrist. </span>
<span sid='44847' title='44847'>I suppose five foot six would be about it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44848' title='44848'>'That is very important,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='44849' title='44849'>'And now, Mr Soames, I wish you good-night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44850' title='44850'>Our guide cried aloud in his astonishment and dismay. </span>
<span sid='44851' title='44851'>'Good gracious, Mr Holmes, you are surely not going to leave me in this abrupt fashion! </span>
<span sid='44852' title='44852'>You don't seem to realize the position. </span>
<span sid='44853' title='44853'>To-morrow is the examination. </span>
<span sid='44854' title='44854'>I must take some definite action tonight. </span>
<span sid='44855' title='44855'>I cannot allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with. </span>
<span sid='44856' title='44856'>The situation must be faced.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44857' title='44857'>'You must leave it as it is. </span>
<span sid='44858' title='44858'>I shall drop round early to-morrow morning and chat the matter over. </span>
<span sid='44859' title='44859'>It is possible that I may be in a position then to indicate some course of action. </span>
<span sid='44860' title='44860'>Meanwhile you change nothing - nothing at all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44861' title='44861'>'Very good, Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44862' title='44862'>'You can be perfectly easy in your mind. </span>
<span sid='44863' title='44863'>We shall certainly find some way out of your difficulties. </span>
<span sid='44864' title='44864'>I will take the black clay with me, also the pencil cuttings. </span>
<span sid='44865' title='44865'>Good-bye.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44866' title='44866'>When we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle we again looked up at the windows. </span>
<span sid='44867' title='44867'>The Indian still paced his room. </span>
<span sid='44868' title='44868'>The others were invisible.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44869' title='44869'>'Well, Watson, what do you think of it?' Holmes asked as we came out into the main street. </span>
<span sid='44870' title='44870'>'Quite a little parlour game - sort of three-card trick, is it not? </span>
<span sid='44871' title='44871'>There are your three men. </span>
<span sid='44872' title='44872'>It must be one of them. </span>
<span sid='44873' title='44873'>You take your choice. </span>
<span sid='44874' title='44874'>Which is yours?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44875' title='44875'>'The foul-mouthed fellow at the top. </span>
<span sid='44876' title='44876'>He is the one with the worst record. </span>
<span sid='44877' title='44877'>And yet that Indian was a sly fellow also. </span>
<span sid='44878' title='44878'>Why should he be pacing his room all the time?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44879' title='44879'>'There is nothing in that. </span>
<span sid='44880' title='44880'>Many men do it when they are trying to learn anything by heart.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44881' title='44881'>'He looked at us in a queer way.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44882' title='44882'>'So would you if a flock of strangers came in on you when you were preparing for an examination next day, and every moment was of value. </span>
<span sid='44883' title='44883'>No, I see nothing in that. </span>
<span sid='44884' title='44884'>Pencils, too, and knives - all was satisfactory. </span>
<span sid='44885' title='44885'>But that fellow does puzzle me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44886' title='44886'>'Who?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44887' title='44887'>'Why, Bannister, the servant. </span>
<span sid='44888' title='44888'>What's his game in the matter?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44889' title='44889'>'He impressed me as being a perfectly honest man.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44890' title='44890'>'So he did me. </span>
<span sid='44891' title='44891'>That's the puzzling part. </span>
<span sid='44892' title='44892'>Why should a perfectly honest man - well, well, here's a large stationer's. </span>
<span sid='44893' title='44893'>We shall begin our researches here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44894' title='44894'>There were only four stationers of any consequence in the town, and at each Holmes produced his pencil chips and bid high for a duplicate. </span>
<span sid='44895' title='44895'>All were agreed that one could be ordered, but that it was not a usual size of pencil, and that It was seldom kept in stock. </span>
<span sid='44896' title='44896'>My friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure, but shrugged his shoulders in half-humorous resignation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44897' title='44897'>'No good, my dear Watson. </span>
<span sid='44898' title='44898'>This, the best and only final clue, has run to nothing. </span>
<span sid='44899' title='44899'>But, indeed, I have little doubt that we can build up a sufficient case without it. </span>
<span sid='44900' title='44900'>By Jove! my dear fellow, it is nearly nine, and the landlady babbled of green peas at seven-thirty. </span>
<span sid='44901' title='44901'>What with your eternal tobacco, Watson, and your irregularity at meals, I expect that you will get notice to quit, and that I shall share your downfall - not, however, before we have solved the problem of the nervous tutor, the careless servant, and the three enterprising students.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44902' title='44902'>Holmes made no further allusion to the matter that day, though he sat lost in thought for a long time after our belated dinner. </span>
<span sid='44903' title='44903'>At eight in the morning he came into my room just as I finished my toilet.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44904' title='44904'>'Well, Watson,' said he, 'it is time we went down to St Luke's. </span>
<span sid='44905' title='44905'>Can you do without breakfast?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44906' title='44906'>'Certainly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44907' title='44907'>'Soames will be in a dreadful fidget until we are able to tell him something positive.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44908' title='44908'>'Have you anything positive to tell him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44909' title='44909'>'I think so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44910' title='44910'>'You have formed a conclusion?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44911' title='44911'>'Yes, my dear Watson; I have solved the mystery.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44912' title='44912'>'But what fresh evidence could you have got?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44913' title='44913'>'Aha! </span>
<span sid='44914' title='44914'>It is not for nothing that I have turned myself out of bed at the untimely hour of six. </span>
<span sid='44915' title='44915'>I have put in two hours' hard work and covered at least five miles, with something to show for it. </span>
<span sid='44916' title='44916'>Look at that!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44917' title='44917'>He held out his hand. </span>
<span sid='44918' title='44918'>On the palm were three little pyramids of black, doughy clay.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44919' title='44919'>'Why, Holmes, you had only two yesterday!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44920' title='44920'>'And one more this morning. </span>
<span sid='44921' title='44921'>It is a fair argument, that wherever No. 3 came from is also the source of Nos. 1 and 2. </span>
<span sid='44922' title='44922'>Eh, Watson? </span>
<span sid='44923' title='44923'>Well, come along and put friend Soames out of his pain.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44924' title='44924'>The unfortunate tutor was certainly in a state of pitiable agitation when we found him in his chambers. </span>
<span sid='44925' title='44925'>In a few hours the examinations would commence and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts public and allowing the culprit to compete for the valuable scholarship. </span>
<span sid='44926' title='44926'>He could hardly stand still, so great was his mental agitation, and he ran towards Holmes with two eager hands outstretched.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44927' title='44927'>'Thank God that you have come! </span>
<span sid='44928' title='44928'>I feared that you had given it up in despair. </span>
<span sid='44929' title='44929'>What am I to do? </span>
<span sid='44930' title='44930'>Shall the examination proceed?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44931' title='44931'>'Yes; let it proceed by all means.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44932' title='44932'>'But this rascal-?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44933' title='44933'>'He shall not compete.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44934' title='44934'>'You know him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44935' title='44935'>'I think so. </span>
<span sid='44936' title='44936'>If this matter is not to become public we must give ourselves certain powers, and resolve ourselves into a small private court-martial. </span>
<span sid='44937' title='44937'>You there, if you please, Soames! </span>
<span sid='44938' title='44938'>Watson, you here! </span>
<span sid='44939' title='44939'>I'll take the arm-chair in the middle. </span>
<span sid='44940' title='44940'>I think that we are now sufficiently imposing to strike terror into a guilty breast. </span>
<span sid='44941' title='44941'>Kindly ring the bell!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44942' title='44942'>Bannister entered, and shrank back in evident surprise and fear at our judicial appearance.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44943' title='44943'>'You will kindly close the door,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='44944' title='44944'>'Now, Bannister, will you please tell us the truth about yesterday's incident?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44945' title='44945'>The man turned white to the roots of his hair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44946' title='44946'>'I have told you everything, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44947' title='44947'>'Nothing to add?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44948' title='44948'>'Nothing at all, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44949' title='44949'>'Well, then, I must make some suggestions to you. </span>
<span sid='44950' title='44950'>When you sat down on that chair yesterday, did you do so in order to conceal some object which would have shown who had been in the room?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44951' title='44951'>Bannister's face was ghastly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44952' title='44952'>'No, sir; certainly not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44953' title='44953'>'It is only a suggestion,' said Holmes, suavely. </span>
<span sid='44954' title='44954'>'I frankly admit that I am unable to prove it. </span>
<span sid='44955' title='44955'>But it seems probable enough, since the moment that Mr Soames's back was turned you released the man who was hiding in that bedroom.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44956' title='44956'>Bannister licked his dry lips.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44957' title='44957'>'There was no man, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44958' title='44958'>'Ah, that's a pity, Bannister. </span>
<span sid='44959' title='44959'>Up to now you may have spoken the truth, but now I know that you have lied.' </span>
<span sid='44960' title='44960'>The man's face set in sullen defiance.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44961' title='44961'>'There was no man, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44962' title='44962'>'Come, come, Bannister.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44963' title='44963'>'No, sir; there was no one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44964' title='44964'>'In that case you can give us no further information. </span>
<span sid='44965' title='44965'>Would you please remain in the room? </span>
<span sid='44966' title='44966'>Stand over there near the bedroom door. </span>
<span sid='44967' title='44967'>Now, Soames, I am going to ask you to have the great kindness to go up to the room of young Gilchrist, and to ask him to step down into yours.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44968' title='44968'>An instant later the tutor returned, bringing with him the student. </span>
<span sid='44969' title='44969'>He was a fine figure of a man, tall, lithe, and agile, with a springy step and a pleasant, open face. </span>
<span sid='44970' title='44970'>His troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us, and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon Bannister in the farther corner.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44971' title='44971'>'Just close the door,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='44972' title='44972'>'Now, Mr Gilchrist, we are all quite alone here, and no one need ever know one word of what passes between us. </span>
<span sid='44973' title='44973'>We can be perfectly frank with each other. </span>
<span sid='44974' title='44974'>We want to know, Mr Gilchrist, how you, an honourable man, ever came to commit such an action as that of yesterday?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44975' title='44975'>The unfortunate young man staggered back, and cast a look full of horror and reproach at Bannister.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44976' title='44976'>'No, no, Mr Gilchrist, sir; I never said a word - never one word!' cried the servant.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44977' title='44977'>'No, but you have now,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='44978' title='44978'>'Now, sir, you must see that after Bannister's words your position is hopeless, and that your only chance lies in a frank confession.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='44979' title='44979'>For a moment Gilchrist, with upraised hand, tried to control his writhing features. </span>
<span sid='44980' title='44980'>The next he had thrown himself on his knees beside the table, and, burying his face in his hands, he burst into a storm of passionate sobbing.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44981' title='44981'>'Come, come,' said Holmes kindly; 'it is human to err, and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal. </span>
<span sid='44982' title='44982'>Perhaps it would be easier for you if I were to tell Mr Soames what occurred, and you can check me where I am wrong. </span>
<span sid='44983' title='44983'>Shall I do so? </span>
<span sid='44984' title='44984'>Well, well, don't trouble to answer. </span>
<span sid='44985' title='44985'>Listen, and see that I do you no injustice.</span>
<p>
<span sid='44986' title='44986'>'From the moment, Mr Soames, that you said to me that no one, not even Bannister, could have told that the papers were in your room, the case began to take a definite shape in my mind. </span>
<span sid='44987' title='44987'>The printer one could, of course, dismiss. </span>
<span sid='44988' title='44988'>He could examine the papers in his own office. </span>
<span sid='44989' title='44989'>The Indian I also thought nothing of. </span>
<span sid='44990' title='44990'>If the proofs were in the roll he could not possibly know what they were. </span>
<span sid='44991' title='44991'>On the other hand, it seemed an unthinkable coincidence that a man should dare to enter the room, and that by chance on that very day the papers were on the table. </span>
<span sid='44992' title='44992'>I dismissed that. </span>
<span sid='44993' title='44993'>The man who entered knew that the papers were there. </span>
<span sid='44994' title='44994'>How did he know?</span>
<p>
<span sid='44995' title='44995'>'When I approached your room I examined the window. </span>
<span sid='44996' title='44996'>You amused me by supposing that I was contemplating the possibility of someone having in broad daylight, under the eyes of all these opposite rooms, forced himself through it. </span>
<span sid='44997' title='44997'>Such an idea was absurd. </span>
<span sid='44998' title='44998'>I was measuring how tall a man would need to be in order to see as he passed what papers were on the central table. </span>
<span sid='44999' title='44999'>I am six feet high, and I could do it with an effort. </span>
<span sid='45000' title='45000'>No one less than that would have a chance. </span>
<span sid='45001' title='45001'>Already, you see, I had reason to think that if one of your three students was a man of unusual height he was the most worth watching of the three.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45002' title='45002'>'I entered, and I took you into my confidence as to the suggestions of the side-table. </span>
<span sid='45003' title='45003'>Of the centre table I could make nothing, until in your description of Gilchrist you mentioned that he was a long-distance jumper. </span>
<span sid='45004' title='45004'>Then the whole thing came to me in an instant, and I only needed certain corroborative proofs, which I speedily obtained.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45005' title='45005'>'What happened was this. </span>
<span sid='45006' title='45006'>This young fellow had employed his afternoon at the athletic grounds, where he had been practising the jump. </span>
<span sid='45007' title='45007'>He returned carrying his jumping- shoes, which are provided, as you are aware, with several spikes. </span>
<span sid='45008' title='45008'>As he passed your window he saw, by means of his great height, these proofs upon your table, and conjectured what they were. </span>
<span sid='45009' title='45009'>No harm would have been done had it not been that as he passed your door he perceived the key which had been left by the carelessness of your servant. </span>
<span sid='45010' title='45010'>A sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if they were indeed the proofs. </span>
<span sid='45011' title='45011'>It was not a dangerous exploit, for he could always pretend that he had simply looked in to ask a question.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45012' title='45012'>'Well, when he saw that they were indeed the proofs, it was then that he yielded to temptation. </span>
<span sid='45013' title='45013'>He put his shoes on the table. </span>
<span sid='45014' title='45014'>What was it you put on that chair near the window?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45015' title='45015'>'Gloves,' said the young man.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45016' title='45016'>Holmes looked triumphantly at Bannister.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45017' title='45017'>'He put his gloves on the chair, and he took the proofs, sheet by sheet, to copy them. </span>
<span sid='45018' title='45018'>He thought the tutor must return by the main gate, and that he would see him. </span>
<span sid='45019' title='45019'>As we know, he came back by the side gate. </span>
<span sid='45020' title='45020'>Suddenly he heard him at the very door. </span>
<span sid='45021' title='45021'>There was no possible escape. </span>
<span sid='45022' title='45022'>He forgot his gloves, but he caught up his shoes and darted into the bedroom. </span>
<span sid='45023' title='45023'>You observe that the scratch on that table is slight at one side, but deepens in the direction of the bedroom door. </span>
<span sid='45024' title='45024'>That in itself is enough to show us that the shoes had been drawn in that direction, and that the culprit had taken refuge there. </span>
<span sid='45025' title='45025'>The earth round the spike had been left on the table, and a second sample was loosened and fell in the bedroom. </span>
<span sid='45026' title='45026'>I may add that I walked out to the athletic grounds this morning, saw that tenacious black clay is used in the jumping-pit, and carried away a specimen of it, together with some of the fine tan or sawdust which is strewn over it to prevent the athlete from slipping. </span>
<span sid='45027' title='45027'>Have I told the truth, Mr Gilchrist?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45028' title='45028'>The student had drawn himself erect.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45029' title='45029'>'Yes, sir, it is true,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45030' title='45030'>'Good God, have you nothing to add?' cried Soames.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45031' title='45031'>'Yes, sir, I have, but the shock of this disgraceful exposure has bewildered me. </span>
<span sid='45032' title='45032'>I have a letter here, Mr Soames, which I wrote to you early this morning in the middle of a restless night. </span>
<span sid='45033' title='45033'>It was before I knew that my sin had found me out. </span>
<span sid='45034' title='45034'>Here it is, sir. </span>
<span sid='45035' title='45035'>You will see that I have said, "I have determined not to go in for the examination. </span>
<span sid='45036' title='45036'>I have been offered a commission in the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Rhodesia&t=h'>Rhodesia</a>n Police, and I am going out to South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a> at once."'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45037' title='45037'>'I am indeed pleased to hear that you did not intend to profit by your unfair advantage,' said Soames. </span>
<span sid='45038' title='45038'>'But why did you change your purpose?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45039' title='45039'>Gilchrist pointed to Bannister.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45040' title='45040'>'There is the man who sent me in the right path,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='45041' title='45041'>'Come now, Bannister,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='45042' title='45042'>'It will be clear to you from what I have said that only you could have let this young man out, since you were left in the room and must have locked the door when you went out. </span>
<span sid='45043' title='45043'>As to his escaping by that window, it was incredible. </span>
<span sid='45044' title='45044'>Can you not clear up the last point in this mystery, and tell us the reason for your action?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45045' title='45045'>'It was simple enough, sir, if you had only known; but with all your cleverness it was impossible that you could know. </span>
<span sid='45046' title='45046'>Time was, sir, when I was butler to old Sir Jabez Gilchrist, this young gentleman's father. </span>
<span sid='45047' title='45047'>When he was ruined I came to the college as servant, but I never forgot my old employer because he was down in the world. </span>
<span sid='45048' title='45048'>I watched his son all I could for the sake of the old days. </span>
<span sid='45049' title='45049'>Well, sir, when I came into this room yesterday when the alarm was given, the first thing I saw was Mr Gilchrist's tan gloves a-lying in that chair. </span>
<span sid='45050' title='45050'>I knew those gloves well, and I understood their message. </span>
<span sid='45051' title='45051'>If Mr Soames saw them the game was up. </span>
<span sid='45052' title='45052'>I flopped down into that chair, and nothing would budge me until Mr Soames he went for you. </span>
<span sid='45053' title='45053'>Then out came my poor young master, whom I had dandled on my knee, and confessed it all to me. </span>
<span sid='45054' title='45054'>Wasn't it natural, sir, that I should save him, and wasn't it natural also that I should try to speak to him as his dead father would have done, and make him understand that he could not profit by such a deed? </span>
<span sid='45055' title='45055'>Could you blame me, sir?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='45056' title='45056'>'No, indeed!' said Holmes heartily, springing to his feet. </span>
<span sid='45057' title='45057'>'Well, Soames, I think we have cleared your little problem up, and our breakfast awaits us at home. </span>
<span sid='45058' title='45058'>Come, Watson! </span>
<span sid='45059' title='45059'>As to you, sir, I trust that a bright future awaits you in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Rhodesia&t=h'>Rhodesia</a>. </span>
<span sid='45060' title='45060'>For once you have fallen low. </span>
<span sid='45061' title='45061'>Let us see in the Future how high you can rise.'</span>
