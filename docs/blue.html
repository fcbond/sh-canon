<p>
<span sid='12001' title='12001'>I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season. </span>
<span sid='12002' title='12002'>He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. </span>
<span sid='12003' title='12003'>Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. </span>
<span sid='12004' title='12004'>A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12005' title='12005'>'You are engaged,' said I; 'perhaps I interrupt you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12006' title='12006'>'Not at all. </span>
<span sid='12007' title='12007'>I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results. </span>
<span sid='12008' title='12008'>The matter is a perfectly trivial one' (he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat), 'but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest, and even of instruction.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12009' title='12009'>I seated myself in his arm-chair, and warmed my hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice crystals. </span>
<span sid='12010' title='12010'>'I suppose,' I remarked, 'that, homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it - that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery, and the punishment of some crime.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12011' title='12011'>'No, no. </span>
<span sid='12012' title='12012'>No crime,' said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. </span>
<span sid='12013' title='12013'>'Only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles. </span>
<span sid='12014' title='12014'>Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal. </span>
<span sid='12015' title='12015'>We have already had experience of such.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12016' title='12016'>'So much so,' I remarked, 'that, of the last six cases which I have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12017' title='12017'>'Precisely. </span>
<span sid='12018' title='12018'>You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip. </span>
<span sid='12019' title='12019'>Well, I have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category. </span>
<span sid='12020' title='12020'>You know Peterson, the commissionaire?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12021' title='12021'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12022' title='12022'>'It is to him that this trophy belongs!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12023' title='12023'>'It is his hat.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12024' title='12024'>'No, no, he found it. </span>
<span sid='12025' title='12025'>Its owner is unknown. </span>
<span sid='12026' title='12026'>I beg that you will look upon it, not as a battered billycock, but as an intellectual problem. </span>
<span sid='12027' title='12027'>And, first as to how it came here. </span>
<span sid='12028' title='12028'>It arrived upon Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson's fire. </span>
<span sid='12029' title='12029'>The facts are these. </span>
<span sid='12030' title='12030'>About four o'clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification, and was making his way homewards down <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Tottenham Court Road&t=h'>Tottenham Court Road</a>. </span>
<span sid='12031' title='12031'>In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. </span>
<span sid='12032' title='12032'>As he reached the corner of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Goodge Street&t=h'>Goodge Street</a> a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs. </span>
<span sid='12033' title='12033'>One of the latter knocked off the man's hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself, and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him. </span>
<span sid='12034' title='12034'>Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants, but the man, shocked at having broken the window and seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Tottenham Court Road&t=h'>Tottenham Court Road</a>. </span>
<span sid='12035' title='12035'>The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12036' title='12036'>'Which surely he restored to their owner?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12037' title='12037'>'My dear fellow, there lies the problem. </span>
<span sid='12038' title='12038'>It is true that "For Mrs Henry Baker" was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird's left leg, and it is also true that the initials "H.B." are legible upon the lining of this hat; but, as there are some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12039' title='12039'>'What, then, did Peterson do?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12040' title='12040'>'He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning, knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. </span>
<span sid='12041' title='12041'>The goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay. </span>
<span sid='12042' title='12042'>Its finder has carried it off therefore to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12043' title='12043'>'Did he not advertise?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12044' title='12044'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12045' title='12045'>'Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12046' title='12046'>'Only as much as we can deduce.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12047' title='12047'>'From his hat?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12048' title='12048'>'Precisely.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12049' title='12049'>'But you are joking. </span>
<span sid='12050' title='12050'>What can you gather from this old battered felt?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12051' title='12051'>'Here is my lens. </span>
<span sid='12052' title='12052'>You know my methods. </span>
<span sid='12053' title='12053'>What can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12054' title='12054'>I took the tattered object in my hands, and turned it over rather ruefully. </span>
<span sid='12055' title='12055'>It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the worse for wear. </span>
<span sid='12056' title='12056'>The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured. </span>
<span sid='12057' title='12057'>There was no maker's name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials 'H. B.' were scrawled upon one side. </span>
<span sid='12058' title='12058'>It was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. </span>
<span sid='12059' title='12059'>For the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12060' title='12060'>'I can see nothing,' said I, handing it back to my friend.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12061' title='12061'>'On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. </span>
<span sid='12062' title='12062'>You fail, however, to reason from what you see. </span>
<span sid='12063' title='12063'>You are too timid in drawing your inferences.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12064' title='12064'>'Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12065' title='12065'>He picked it up, and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him. </span>
<span sid='12066' title='12066'>'It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been,' he remarked, 'and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability. </span>
<span sid='12067' title='12067'>That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. </span>
<span sid='12068' title='12068'>He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at work upon him. </span>
<span sid='12069' title='12069'>This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12070' title='12070'>'My dear Holmes!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12071' title='12071'>'He has, however, retained some degree of selfrespect,' he continued, disregarding my remonstrance. </span>
<span sid='12072' title='12072'>'He is a man who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. </span>
<span sid='12073' title='12073'>These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. </span>
<span sid='12074' title='12074'>Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12075' title='12075'>'You are certainly joking, Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12076' title='12076'>'Not in the least. </span>
<span sid='12077' title='12077'>Is it possible that even now when I give you these results you are unable to see how they are attained?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12078' title='12078'>'I have no doubt that I am very stupid; but I must confess that I am unable to follow you. </span>
<span sid='12079' title='12079'>For example, how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12080' title='12080'>For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. </span>
<span sid='12081' title='12081'>It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. </span>
<span sid='12082' title='12082'>'It is a question of cubic capacity,' said he: 'a man with so large a brain must have something in it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12083' title='12083'>'The decline of his fortunes, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12084' title='12084'>'This hat is three years old. </span>
<span sid='12085' title='12085'>These flat brims curled at the edge came in then. </span>
<span sid='12086' title='12086'>It is a hat of the very best quality. </span>
<span sid='12087' title='12087'>Look at the band of ribbed silk, and the excellent lining. </span>
<span sid='12088' title='12088'>If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12089' title='12089'>'Well, that is dear enough, certainly. </span>
<span sid='12090' title='12090'>But how about the foresight, and the moral retrogression?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12091' title='12091'>Sherlock Holmes laughed. </span>
<span sid='12092' title='12092'>'Here is the foresight,' said he, putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. </span>
<span sid='12093' title='12093'>'They are never sold upon hats. </span>
<span sid='12094' title='12094'>If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind. </span>
<span sid='12095' title='12095'>But since we see that he has broken the elastic, and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. </span>
<span sid='12096' title='12096'>On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12097' title='12097'>'Your reasoning is certainly plausible.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12098' title='12098'>'The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. </span>
<span sid='12099' title='12099'>The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. </span>
<span sid='12100' title='12100'>They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream. </span>
<span sid='12101' title='12101'>This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street, but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time; while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could, therefore, hardly be in the best of training.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12102' title='12102'>'But his wife - you said that she had ceased to love him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12103' title='12103'>'This hat has not been brushed for weeks. </span>
<span sid='12104' title='12104'>When I see you, my dear Watson, with a week's accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife's affection.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12105' title='12105'>'But he might be a bachelor.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12106' title='12106'>'Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peaceoffering to his wife. </span>
<span sid='12107' title='12107'>Remember the card upon the bird's leg.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12108' title='12108'>'You have an answer to everything. </span>
<span sid='12109' title='12109'>But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in the house?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12110' title='12110'>'One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but, when I see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow - walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other. </span>
<span sid='12111' title='12111'>Anyhow, he never got tallow stains from a gas jet. </span>
<span sid='12112' title='12112'>Are you satisfied?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12113' title='12113'>'Well, it is very ingenious,' said I, laughing; 'but since, as you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12114' title='12114'>Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and Peterson the commissionaire rushed into the compartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12115' title='12115'>'The goose, Mr. Holmes! </span>
<span sid='12116' title='12116'>The goose, sir!' he gasped.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12117' title='12117'>'Eh! </span>
<span sid='12118' title='12118'>What of it, then? </span>
<span sid='12119' title='12119'>Has it returned to life, and flapped off through the kitchen window?' </span>
<span sid='12120' title='12120'>Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man's excited face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12121' title='12121'>'See here, sir! </span>
<span sid='12122' title='12122'>See what my wife found in its crop!' </span>
<span sid='12123' title='12123'>He held out his hand, and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12124' title='12124'>Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. </span>
<span sid='12125' title='12125'>'By Jove, Peterson,' said he, 'this is treasure-trove indeed! </span>
<span sid='12126' title='12126'>I suppose you know what you have got?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12127' title='12127'>'A diamond, sir! </span>
<span sid='12128' title='12128'>A precious stone! </span>
<span sid='12129' title='12129'>It cuts into glass as though it were putty.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12130' title='12130'>'It's more than a precious stone. </span>
<span sid='12131' title='12131'>It's the precious stone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12132' title='12132'>'Not the Countess of Morcar's blue carbuncle?' I ejaculated.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12133' title='12133'>'Precisely so. </span>
<span sid='12134' title='12134'>I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day lately. </span>
<span sid='12135' title='12135'>It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the reward offered of a thousand pounds is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12136' title='12136'>'A thousand pounds! </span>
<span sid='12137' title='12137'>Great Lord of mercy!' </span>
<span sid='12138' title='12138'>The commissionaire plumped down into a chair, and stared from one to the other of us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12139' title='12139'>'That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the Countess to part with half of her fortune if she could but recover the gem.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12140' title='12140'>'It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan,' I remarked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12141' title='12141'>'Precisely so, on the twenty-second of December, just five days ago. </span>
<span sid='12142' title='12142'>John Horner, a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady's jewelcase. </span>
<span sid='12143' title='12143'>The evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the Assizes. </span>
<span sid='12144' title='12144'>I have some account of the matter here, I believe.' </span>
<span sid='12145' title='12145'>He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:</span>
<p>
<span sid='12146' title='12146'>'Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. </span>
<span sid='12147' title='12147'>John Horner, 26, plumber, was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted from the jewelcase of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle. </span>
<span sid='12148' title='12148'>James Ryder, upperattendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery, in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. </span>
<span sid='12149' title='12149'>He had remained with Horner some little time but had finally been called away. </span>
<span sid='12150' title='12150'>On returning he found that Horner had disappeared, that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressingtable. </span>
<span sid='12151' title='12151'>Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. </span>
<span sid='12152' title='12152'>Catherine Cusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder's cry of dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room, where she found matters were as described by the last witness. </span>
<span sid='12153' title='12153'>Inspector Bradstreet, B Division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest terms. </span>
<span sid='12154' title='12154'>Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to the Assizes. </span>
<span sid='12155' title='12155'>Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion, and was carried out of court.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12156' title='12156'>'Hum! </span>
<span sid='12157' title='12157'>So much for the police-court,' said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing aside his paper. </span>
<span sid='12158' title='12158'>'The question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a goose in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Tottenham Court Road&t=h'>Tottenham Court Road</a> at the other. </span>
<span sid='12159' title='12159'>You see, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect. </span>
<span sid='12160' title='12160'>Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which I have bored you. </span>
<span sid='12161' title='12161'>So now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman, and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. </span>
<span sid='12162' title='12162'>To do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. </span>
<span sid='12163' title='12163'>If this fail, I shall have recourse to other methods.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12164' title='12164'>'What will you say?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12165' title='12165'>'Give me a pencil, and that slip of paper. </span>
<span sid='12166' title='12166'>Now, then: </span>
<span sid='12167' title='12167'>"Found at the corner of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Goodge Street&t=h'>Goodge Street</a>, a goose and a black felt hat. </span>
<span sid='12168' title='12168'>Mr. Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6.30 this evening at 221B <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>.' </span>
<span sid='12169' title='12169'>That is clear and concise.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12170' title='12170'>'Very. </span>
<span sid='12171' title='12171'>But will he see it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12172' title='12172'>'Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one. </span>
<span sid='12173' title='12173'>He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window, and by the approach of Peterson, that he thought of nothing but flight; but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird. </span>
<span sid='12174' title='12174'>Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for every one who knows him will direct his attention to it. </span>
<span sid='12175' title='12175'>Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency, and have this put in the evening papers.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12176' title='12176'>'In which, sir?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12177' title='12177'>'Oh, in the Globe, Star, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Pall Mall&t=h'>Pall Mall</a>, St. James's Gazette, Evening News, Standard, Echo, and any others that occur to you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12178' title='12178'>'Very well, sir. </span>
<span sid='12179' title='12179'>And this stone?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12180' title='12180'>'Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. </span>
<span sid='12181' title='12181'>Thank you. </span>
<span sid='12182' title='12182'>And, I say, Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back, and leave it here with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12183' title='12183'>When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it against the light. </span>
<span sid='12184' title='12184'>'It's a bonny thing,' said he. </span>
<span sid='12185' title='12185'>'Just see how it glints and sparkles. </span>
<span sid='12186' title='12186'>Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. </span>
<span sid='12187' title='12187'>Every good stone is. </span>
<span sid='12188' title='12188'>They are the devil's pet baits. </span>
<span sid='12189' title='12189'>In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. </span>
<span sid='12190' title='12190'>This stone is not yet twenty years old. </span>
<span sid='12191' title='12191'>It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in Southern <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=China&t=h'>China</a>, and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade, instead of ruby red. </span>
<span sid='12192' title='12192'>In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history. </span>
<span sid='12193' title='12193'>There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallized charcoal. </span>
<span sid='12194' title='12194'>Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison? </span>
<span sid='12195' title='12195'>I'll lock it up in my strong-box now, and drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it!</span>
<p>
<span sid='12196' title='12196'>'Do you think this man Horner is innocent?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12197' title='12197'>'I cannot tell.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12198' title='12198'>'Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had anything to do with the matter?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12199' title='12199'>'It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. </span>
<span sid='12200' title='12200'>That, however, I shall determine by a very simple test, if we have an answer to our advertisement.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12201' title='12201'>'And you can do nothing until then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12202' title='12202'>'Nothing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12203' title='12203'>'In that case I shall continue my professional round. </span>
<span sid='12204' title='12204'>But I shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like to see the solution of so tangled a business.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12205' title='12205'>'Very glad to see you. </span>
<span sid='12206' title='12206'>I dine at seven. </span>
<span sid='12207' title='12207'>There is a woodcock, I believe. </span>
<span sid='12208' title='12208'>By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12209' title='12209'>I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six when I found myself in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> once more. </span>
<span sid='12210' title='12210'>As I approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet, with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin, waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. </span>
<span sid='12211' title='12211'>Just as I arrived, the door was opened, and we were shown up together to Holmes's room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12212' title='12212'>'Mr. Henry Baker, I believe,' said he, rising from his arm-chair, and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume. </span>
<span sid='12213' title='12213'>'Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. </span>
<span sid='12214' title='12214'>It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter. </span>
<span sid='12215' title='12215'>Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right time. </span>
<span sid='12216' title='12216'>Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12217' title='12217'>'Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.' </span>
<span sid='12218' title='12218'>He was a large man, with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. </span>
<span sid='12219' title='12219'>A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes's surmise as to his habits. </span>
<span sid='12220' title='12220'>His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. </span>
<span sid='12221' title='12221'>He spoke in a low staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12222' title='12222'>'We have retained these things for some days,' said Holmes, 'because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. </span>
<span sid='12223' title='12223'>I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12224' title='12224'>Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. </span>
<span sid='12225' title='12225'>'Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were,' he remarked. </span>
<span sid='12226' title='12226'>'I had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird. </span>
<span sid='12227' title='12227'>I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12228' title='12228'>'Very naturally. </span>
<span sid='12229' title='12229'>By the way, about the bird - we were compelled to eat it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12230' title='12230'>'To eat it!' </span>
<span sid='12231' title='12231'>Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12232' title='12232'>'Yes; it would have been no use to anyone had we not done so. </span>
<span sid='12233' title='12233'>But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12234' title='12234'>'Oh, certainly, certainly!' answered Mr. Baker, with a sigh of relief.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12235' title='12235'>'Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own bird, if you so wish-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12236' title='12236'>The man burst into a hearty laugh. </span>
<span sid='12237' title='12237'>'They might be useful to me as relics of my adventure,' said he, 'but beyond that I can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me. </span>
<span sid='12238' title='12238'>No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12239' title='12239'>Sherlock Holmes glanced across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12240' title='12240'>'There is your hat, then, and there your bird,' said he. </span>
<span sid='12241' title='12241'>'By the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? </span>
<span sid='12242' title='12242'>I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a bettergrown goose.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12243' title='12243'>'Certainly, sir,' said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm. </span>
<span sid='12244' title='12244'>'There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn near the Museum - we are to be found in the Museum itself during the day, you understand. </span>
<span sid='12245' title='12245'>This year our good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose-club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were to receive a bird at Christmas. </span>
<span sid='12246' title='12246'>My pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. </span>
<span sid='12247' title='12247'>I am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.' </span>
<span sid='12248' title='12248'>With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us, and strode off upon his way.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12249' title='12249'>'So much for Mr. Henry Baker,' said Holmes, when he had closed the door behind him. </span>
<span sid='12250' title='12250'>'It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter. </span>
<span sid='12251' title='12251'>Are you hungry, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12252' title='12252'>'Not particularly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12253' title='12253'>'Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper, and follow up this due while it is still hot.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12254' title='12254'>'By all means.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12255' title='12255'>It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats. </span>
<span sid='12256' title='12256'>Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots. </span>
<span sid='12257' title='12257'>Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors' quarter, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Wimpole Street&t=h'>Wimpole Street</a>, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Harley Street&t=h'>Harley Street</a>, and so through <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Wigmore Street&t=h'>Wigmore Street</a> into <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Oxford Street&t=h'>Oxford Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='12258' title='12258'>In a quarter of an hour we were in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bloomsbury&t=h'>Bloomsbury</a> at the Alpha Inn, which is a small publichouse at the corner of one of the streets which run down into <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Holborn&t=h'>Holborn</a>. </span>
<span sid='12259' title='12259'>Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar, and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12260' title='12260'>'Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,' he said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12261' title='12261'>'My geese!' </span>
<span sid='12262' title='12262'>The man seemed surprised.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12263' title='12263'>'Yes. </span>
<span sid='12264' title='12264'>I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was a member of your goose-club.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12265' title='12265'>'Ah! yes, I see. </span>
<span sid='12266' title='12266'>But you see, sir, them's not our geese.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12267' title='12267'>'Indeed! </span>
<span sid='12268' title='12268'>Whose, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12269' title='12269'>'Well, I get the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12270' title='12270'>'Indeed! </span>
<span sid='12271' title='12271'>I know some of them. </span>
<span sid='12272' title='12272'>Which was it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12273' title='12273'>'Breckinridge is his name.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12274' title='12274'>'Ah! </span>
<span sid='12275' title='12275'>I don't know him. </span>
<span sid='12276' title='12276'>Well, here's your good health, landlord, and prosperity to your house. </span>
<span sid='12277' title='12277'>Good night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12278' title='12278'>'Now for Mr. Breckinridge', he continued, buttoning up his coat, as we came out into the frosty air. </span>
<span sid='12279' title='12279'>'Remember, Watson, that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years' penal servitude, unless we can establish his innocence. </span>
<span sid='12280' title='12280'>It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. </span>
<span sid='12281' title='12281'>Let us follow it out to the bitter end. </span>
<span sid='12282' title='12282'>Faces to the south, then, and quick march!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12283' title='12283'>We passed across <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Holborn&t=h'>Holborn</a>, down <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Endell Street&t=h'>Endell Street</a>, and so through a zigzag of slums to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Covent Garden Market&t=h'>Covent Garden Market</a>. </span>
<span sid='12284' title='12284'>One of the largest stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor, a horsy-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers, was helping a boy to put up the shutters.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12285' title='12285'>'Good evening. </span>
<span sid='12286' title='12286'>It's a cold night,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12287' title='12287'>The salesman nodded, and shot a questioning glance at my companion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12288' title='12288'>'Sold out of geese, I see,' continued Holmes, pointing at the bare slabs of marble.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12289' title='12289'>'Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12290' title='12290'>'That's no good.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12291' title='12291'>'Well, there are some on the stall with the gas flare.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12292' title='12292'>'Ah, but I was recommended to you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12293' title='12293'>'Who by?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12294' title='12294'>'The landlord of the "Alpha".'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12295' title='12295'>'Ah, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12296' title='12296'>'Fine birds they were, too. </span>
<span sid='12297' title='12297'>Now where did you get them from?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12298' title='12298'>To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12299' title='12299'>'Now then, mister,' said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo, 'what are you driving at? </span>
<span sid='12300' title='12300'>Let's have it straight, now.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12301' title='12301'>'It is straight enough. </span>
<span sid='12302' title='12302'>I should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the "Alpha".'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12303' title='12303'>'Well, then, I shan't tell you. </span>
<span sid='12304' title='12304'>So now!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12305' title='12305'>'Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don't know why you should be so warm over such a trifle.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12306' title='12306'>'Warm! </span>
<span sid='12307' title='12307'>You'd be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. </span>
<span sid='12308' title='12308'>When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end to the business; but it's "Where are the geese?" and "Who did you sell the geese to?" and "What will you take for the geese?".</span>
<p>
<span sid='12309' title='12309'>One would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over them.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12310' title='12310'>'Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries,' said Holmes carelessly. </span>
<span sid='12311' title='12311'>'If you won't tell us the bet is off, that is all. </span>
<span sid='12312' title='12312'>But I'm always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12313' title='12313'>'Well, then, you've lost your fiver, for it's town bred,' snapped the salesman.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12314' title='12314'>'It's nothing of the kind.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12315' title='12315'>'I say it is.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12316' title='12316'>'I don't believe you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12317' title='12317'>'D'you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them ever since I was a nipper? </span>
<span sid='12318' title='12318'>I tell you, all those birds that went to the "Alpha" were town bred.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12319' title='12319'>'You'll never persuade me to believe that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12320' title='12320'>'Will you bet, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12321' title='12321'>'It's merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. </span>
<span sid='12322' title='12322'>But I'll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12323' title='12323'>The salesman chuckled grimly. </span>
<span sid='12324' title='12324'>'Bring me the books, Bill,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12325' title='12325'>The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12326' title='12326'>'Now then, Mr. Cocksure,' said the salesman, 'I thought that I was out of geese, but before I finish you'll find that there is still one left in my shop. </span>
<span sid='12327' title='12327'>You see this little book?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12328' title='12328'>'Well?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12329' title='12329'>'That's the list of the folk from whom I buy. </span>
<span sid='12330' title='12330'>D'you see? </span>
<span sid='12331' title='12331'>Well, then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger. </span>
<span sid='12332' title='12332'>Now, then! </span>
<span sid='12333' title='12333'>You see this other page in red ink? </span>
<span sid='12334' title='12334'>Well, that is a list of my town suppliers. </span>
<span sid='12335' title='12335'>Now, look at that third name. </span>
<span sid='12336' title='12336'>Just read it out to me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12337' title='12337'>'Mrs. Oakshott, 117 <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a> Road - 249,' read Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12338' title='12338'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='12339' title='12339'>Now turn that up in the ledger.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12340' title='12340'>Holmes turned to the page indicated. </span>
<span sid='12341' title='12341'>'Here you are, "Mrs. Oakshott, 117 <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a> Road, egg and poultry supplier."'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12342' title='12342'>'Now, then, what's the last entry?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12343' title='12343'>'"December 22. </span>
<span sid='12344' title='12344'>Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d."'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12345' title='12345'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='12346' title='12346'>There you are. </span>
<span sid='12347' title='12347'>And underneath?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12348' title='12348'>'"Sold to Mr. Windigate of the 'Alpha' at 12s."'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12349' title='12349'>'What have you to say now?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12350' title='12350'>Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. </span>
<span sid='12351' title='12351'>He drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. </span>
<span sid='12352' title='12352'>A few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post, and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12353' title='12353'>'When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the "Pink 'Un" protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,' said he. </span>
<span sid='12354' title='12354'>'I dare say that if I had put a hundred pounds down in front of him that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. </span>
<span sid='12355' title='12355'>Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. </span>
<span sid='12356' title='12356'>It is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12357' title='12357'>His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left. </span>
<span sid='12358' title='12358'>Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12359' title='12359'>'I've had enough of you and your geese,' he shouted. </span>
<span sid='12360' title='12360'>'I wish you were all at the devil together. </span>
<span sid='12361' title='12361'>If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk I'll set the dog at you. </span>
<span sid='12362' title='12362'>You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and I'll answer her, but what have you to do with it? </span>
<span sid='12363' title='12363'>Did I buy the geese off you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12364' title='12364'>'No: but one of them was mine all the same,' whined the little man.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12365' title='12365'>'Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12366' title='12366'>'She told me to ask you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12367' title='12367'>'Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. </span>
<span sid='12368' title='12368'>I've had enough of it. </span>
<span sid='12369' title='12369'>Get out of this!' </span>
<span sid='12370' title='12370'>He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12371' title='12371'>'Ha, this may save us a visit to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a> Road,' whispered Holmes. </span>
<span sid='12372' title='12372'>'Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.' </span>
<span sid='12373' title='12373'>Striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder. </span>
<span sid='12374' title='12374'>He sprang round, and I could see in the gaslight that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12375' title='12375'>'Who are you, then? </span>
<span sid='12376' title='12376'>What do you want?' he asked in a quavering voice.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12377' title='12377'>'You will excuse me,' said Holmes blandly, 'but I could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. </span>
<span sid='12378' title='12378'>I think that I could be of assistance to you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12379' title='12379'>'You? </span>
<span sid='12380' title='12380'>Who are you? </span>
<span sid='12381' title='12381'>How could you know anything of the matter?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12382' title='12382'>'My name is Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='12383' title='12383'>It is my business to know what other people don't know.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12384' title='12384'>'But you can know nothing of this?' </span>
<span sid='12385' title='12385'>'Excuse me, I know everything of it. </span>
<span sid='12386' title='12386'>You are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a> Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the "Alpha," and by him to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12387' title='12387'>'Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,' cried the little fellow, with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. </span>
<span sid='12388' title='12388'>'I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12389' title='12389'>Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. </span>
<span sid='12390' title='12390'>'In that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept market-place,' said he. </span>
<span sid='12391' title='12391'>'But pray tell me, before we go further, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12392' title='12392'>The man hesitated for an instant. </span>
<span sid='12393' title='12393'>'My name is John Robinson,' he answered, with a sidelong glance.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12394' title='12394'>'No, no; the real name,' said Holmes sweetly. </span>
<span sid='12395' title='12395'>'It is always awkward doing business with an alias.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12396' title='12396'>A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. </span>
<span sid='12397' title='12397'>'Well, then,' said he, 'my real name is James Ryder.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12398' title='12398'>'Precisely so. </span>
<span sid='12399' title='12399'>Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. </span>
<span sid='12400' title='12400'>Pray step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12401' title='12401'>The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. </span>
<span sid='12402' title='12402'>Then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='12403' title='12403'>Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin breathings of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12404' title='12404'>'Here we are!' said Holmes cheerily, as we filed into the room. </span>
<span sid='12405' title='12405'>'The fire looks very seasonable in this weather. </span>
<span sid='12406' title='12406'>You look cold, Mr. Ryder. </span>
<span sid='12407' title='12407'>Pray take the basket chair. </span>
<span sid='12408' title='12408'>I will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours. </span>
<span sid='12409' title='12409'>Now, then! </span>
<span sid='12410' title='12410'>You want to know what became of those geese?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12411' title='12411'>'Yes, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12412' title='12412'>'Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. </span>
<span sid='12413' title='12413'>It was one bird, I imagine, in which you were interested - white, with a black bar across the tail.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12414' title='12414'>Ryder quivered with emotion. </span>
<span sid='12415' title='12415'>'Oh, sir,' he cried, 'can you tell me where it went to?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12416' title='12416'>'It came here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12417' title='12417'>'Here?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12418' title='12418'>'Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. </span>
<span sid='12419' title='12419'>I don't wonder that you should take an interest in it. </span>
<span sid='12420' title='12420'>It laid an egg after it was dead - the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. </span>
<span sid='12421' title='12421'>I have it here in my museum.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12422' title='12422'>Our visitor staggered to his feet, and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand. </span>
<span sid='12423' title='12423'>Holmes unlocked his strong-box, and held up the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, manypointed radiance. </span>
<span sid='12424' title='12424'>Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12425' title='12425'>'The game's up, Ryder,' said Holmes quietly. </span>
<span sid='12426' title='12426'>'Hold up, man, or you'll be into the fire. </span>
<span sid='12427' title='12427'>Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. </span>
<span sid='12428' title='12428'>He's not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. </span>
<span sid='12429' title='12429'>Give him a dash of brandy. </span>
<span sid='12430' title='12430'>So! </span>
<span sid='12431' title='12431'>Now he looks a littte more human. </span>
<span sid='12432' title='12432'>What a shrimp it is, to be sure!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12433' title='12433'>For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12434' title='12434'>'I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. </span>
<span sid='12435' title='12435'>Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. </span>
<span sid='12436' title='12436'>You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar's?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12437' title='12437'>'It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,' said he, in a crackling voice.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12438' title='12438'>'I see. </span>
<span sid='12439' title='12439'>Her ladyship's waiting-maid. </span>
<span sid='12440' title='12440'>Well, the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used. </span>
<span sid='12441' title='12441'>It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you. </span>
<span sid='12442' title='12442'>You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him. </span>
<span sid='12443' title='12443'>What did you do, then? </span>
<span sid='12444' title='12444'>You made some small job in my lady's room-you and your confederate Cusack - and you managed that he should be the man sent for. </span>
<span sid='12445' title='12445'>Then, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested. </span>
<span sid='12446' title='12446'>You then-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12447' title='12447'>Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug, and clutched at my companion's knees. </span>
<span sid='12448' title='12448'>'For God's sake, have mercy!' he shrieked. </span>
<span sid='12449' title='12449'>'Think of my father! </span>
<span sid='12450' title='12450'>Of my mother! </span>
<span sid='12451' title='12451'>It would break their hearts. </span>
<span sid='12452' title='12452'>I never went wrong before! </span>
<span sid='12453' title='12453'>I never will again. </span>
<span sid='12454' title='12454'>I swear it. </span>
<span sid='12455' title='12455'>I'll swear it on a Bible. </span>
<span sid='12456' title='12456'>Oh, don't bring it into court! </span>
<span sid='12457' title='12457'>For Christ's sake, don't!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12458' title='12458'>'Get back into your chair!' said Holmes sternly. </span>
<span sid='12459' title='12459'>'It is very well to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12460' title='12460'>'I will fly, Mr. Holmes. </span>
<span sid='12461' title='12461'>I will leave the country, sir. </span>
<span sid='12462' title='12462'>Then the charge against him will break down.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12463' title='12463'>'Hum! </span>
<span sid='12464' title='12464'>We will talk about that. </span>
<span sid='12465' title='12465'>And now let us hear a true account of the next act. </span>
<span sid='12466' title='12466'>How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the open market? </span>
<span sid='12467' title='12467'>Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12468' title='12468'>Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. </span>
<span sid='12469' title='12469'>'I will tell you it just as it happened, sir,' said he. </span>
<span sid='12470' title='12470'>'When Horner had been arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room. </span>
<span sid='12471' title='12471'>There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe. </span>
<span sid='12472' title='12472'>I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister's house. </span>
<span sid='12473' title='12473'>She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a> Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. </span>
<span sid='12474' title='12474'>All the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective, and for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down my face before I came to the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a> Road. </span>
<span sid='12475' title='12475'>My sister asked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. </span>
<span sid='12476' title='12476'>Then I went into the back-yard, and smoked a pipe, and wondered what it would be best to do.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12477' title='12477'>'I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just been serving his time in Pentonville. </span>
<span sid='12478' title='12478'>One day he had met me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves and how they could get rid of what they stole. </span>
<span sid='12479' title='12479'>I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things about him, so I made up my mind to go right on to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kilburn&t=h'>Kilburn</a>, where he lived, and take him into my confidence. </span>
<span sid='12480' title='12480'>He would show me how to turn the stone into money. </span>
<span sid='12481' title='12481'>But how to get to him in safety? </span>
<span sid='12482' title='12482'>I thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. </span>
<span sid='12483' title='12483'>I might at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket. </span>
<span sid='12484' title='12484'>I was leaning against the wall at the time, and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12485' title='12485'>'My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as good as her word. </span>
<span sid='12486' title='12486'>I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my stone to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kilburn&t=h'>Kilburn</a>. </span>
<span sid='12487' title='12487'>There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds, a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. </span>
<span sid='12488' title='12488'>I caught it and, prising its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach. </span>
<span sid='12489' title='12489'>The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. </span>
<span sid='12490' title='12490'>But the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the matter. </span>
<span sid='12491' title='12491'>As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose, and fluttered off among the others.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12492' title='12492'>'"Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?" says she.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12493' title='12493'>'"Well," said I, "you said you'd give me one for Christmas, and I was feeling which was the fattest."</span>
<p>
<span sid='12494' title='12494'>'"Oh," says she, "we've set yours aside for you. </span>
<span sid='12495' title='12495'>Jem's bird, we call it. </span>
<span sid='12496' title='12496'>It's the big, white one over yonder. </span>
<span sid='12497' title='12497'>There's twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market."</span>
<p>
<span sid='12498' title='12498'>'"Thank you, Maggie," says I; "but if it is all the same to you I'd rather have that one I was handling just now."</span>
<p>
<span sid='12499' title='12499'>'"The other is a good three pound heavier," she said, "and we fattened it expressly for you."</span>
<p>
<span sid='12500' title='12500'>'"Never mind. </span>
<span sid='12501' title='12501'>I'll have the other, and I'll take it now," said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12502' title='12502'>'"Oh, just as you like," said she, a little huffed. </span>
<span sid='12503' title='12503'>"Which is it you want, then?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='12504' title='12504'>'"That white one, with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock."</span>
<p>
<span sid='12505' title='12505'>'"Oh, very well. </span>
<span sid='12506' title='12506'>Kill it and take it with you."</span>
<p>
<span sid='12507' title='12507'>'Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the way to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kilburn&t=h'>Kilburn</a>. </span>
<span sid='12508' title='12508'>I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. </span>
<span sid='12509' title='12509'>He laughed until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. </span>
<span sid='12510' title='12510'>My heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. </span>
<span sid='12511' title='12511'>I left the bird, rushed back to my sister's, and hurried into the back-yard. </span>
<span sid='12512' title='12512'>There was not a bird to be seen there.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12513' title='12513'>'"Where are they all, Maggie?" I cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12514' title='12514'>'"Gone to the dealer's."</span>
<p>
<span sid='12515' title='12515'>'"Which dealer's?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='12516' title='12516'>'"Breckinridge, of Covent Garden."</span>
<p>
<span sid='12517' title='12517'>'"But was there another with a barred tail?" I asked, "the same as the one I chose?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='12518' title='12518'>'"Yes, Jem, there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell them apart."</span>
<p>
<span sid='12519' title='12519'>'Well, then, of course, I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. </span>
<span sid='12520' title='12520'>You heard him yourselves to-night. </span>
<span sid='12521' title='12521'>Well, he has always answered me like that. </span>
<span sid='12522' title='12522'>My sister thinks that I am going mad. </span>
<span sid='12523' title='12523'>Sometimes I think that I am myself. </span>
<span sid='12524' title='12524'>And now - and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which I sold my character. </span>
<span sid='12525' title='12525'>God help me! </span>
<span sid='12526' title='12526'>God help me!' </span>
<span sid='12527' title='12527'>He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12528' title='12528'>There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing, and by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes's finger-tips upon the edge of the table. </span>
<span sid='12529' title='12529'>Then my friend rose, and threw open the door.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12530' title='12530'>'Get out!' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='12531' title='12531'>'What, sir! </span>
<span sid='12532' title='12532'>Oh, Heaven bless you!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12533' title='12533'>'No more words. </span>
<span sid='12534' title='12534'>Get out!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='12535' title='12535'>And no more words were needed. </span>
<span sid='12536' title='12536'>There was a rush, a clatter upon the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street. </span>
<span sid='12537' title='12537'>'After all, Watson,' said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay pipe, 'I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. </span>
<span sid='12538' title='12538'>If Horner were in danger it would be another thing, but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must collapse. </span>
<span sid='12539' title='12539'>I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul. </span>
<span sid='12540' title='12540'>This fellow will not go wrong again. </span>
<span sid='12541' title='12541'>He is too terribly frightened. </span>
