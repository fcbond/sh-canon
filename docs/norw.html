<p>
<span sid='14507' title='14507'>'From the point of view of the criminal expert,' said Mr Sherlock Holmes, '<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> has become a singularly uninteresting city since the death of the late lamented Professor Moriarty:</span>
<p>
<span sid='14508' title='14508'>'I can hardly think that you would find many decent citizens to agree with you,' I answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14509' title='14509'>'Well, well, I must not be selfish,' said he, with a smile, as he pushed back his chair from the breakfast-table. </span>
<span sid='14510' title='14510'>'The community is certainly the gainer, and no one the loser, save the poor out-of-work specialist, whose occupation has gone. </span>
<span sid='14511' title='14511'>With that man in the field one's morning paper presented infinite possibilities. </span>
<span sid='14512' title='14512'>Often it was only the smallest trace, Watson, the faintest indication, and yet it was enough to tell me that the great malignant brain was there, as the gentlest tremors of the edges of the web remind one of the foul spider which lurks in the centre. </span>
<span sid='14513' title='14513'>Petty thefts, wanton assaults, purposeless outrage - to the man who held the clue all could be worked into one connected whole. </span>
<span sid='14514' title='14514'>To the scientific student of the higher criminal world no capital in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a> offered the advantages which <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> then possessed. </span>
<span sid='14515' title='14515'>But now-' </span>
<span sid='14516' title='14516'>He shrugged his shoulders in humorous deprecation of the state of things which he had himself done so much to produce.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14517' title='14517'>At the time of which I speak, Holmes had been back for some months, and I, at his request, had sold my practice and returned to share the old quarters in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='14518' title='14518'>A young doctor, named Verner, had purchased my small <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kensington&t=h'>Kensington</a> practice, and given with astonishingly little demur the highest price that I ventured to ask - an incident which only explained itself some years later, when I found that Verner was a distant relation of Holmes's, and that it was my friend who had really found the money.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14519' title='14519'>Our months of partnership had not been so uneventful as he had stated, for I find, on looking over my notes, that this period includes the case of the papers of ex-President Murillo, and also the shocking affair of the Dutch steamship Friesland, which so nearly cost us both our lives. </span>
<span sid='14520' title='14520'>His cold and proud nature was always averse, however, to anything in the shape of public applause, and he bound me in the most stringent terms to say no further word of himself, his methods, or his successes	a prohibition which, as I have explained, has only now been removed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14521' title='14521'>Mr Sherlock Holmes was leaning back in his chair after his whimsical protest, and was unfolding his morning paper in a leisurely fashion, when our attention was arrested by a tremendous ring at the bell, followed immediately by a hollow drumming sound, as if someone were beating on the outer door with his fist. </span>
<span sid='14522' title='14522'>As it opened there came a tumultuous rush into the hall, rapid feet clattered up the stair, and an instant later a wild-eyed and frantic young man, pale, dishevelled, and palpitating, burst into the room. </span>
<span sid='14523' title='14523'>He looked from one to the other of us, and under our gaze of inquiry he became conscious that some apology was needed for this unceremonious entry.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14524' title='14524'>'I'm sorry, Mr Holmes,' he cried. </span>
<span sid='14525' title='14525'>'You mustn't blame me. </span>
<span sid='14526' title='14526'>I am nearly mad. </span>
<span sid='14527' title='14527'>Mr Holmes, I am the unhappy John Hector McFarlane.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14528' title='14528'>He made the announcement as if the name alone would explain both his visit and its manner, but I could see by my companion's unresponsive face that it meant no more to him than to me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14529' title='14529'>'Have a cigarette, Mr McFarlane,' said he, pushing his case across. </span>
<span sid='14530' title='14530'>'I am sure that with your symptoms my friend Dr Watson here would prescribe a sedative. </span>
<span sid='14531' title='14531'>The weather has been so very warm these last few days. </span>
<span sid='14532' title='14532'>Now, if you feel a little more composed, I should be glad if you would sit down in that chair and tell us very slowly and quietly who you are and what it is that you want. </span>
<span sid='14533' title='14533'>You mentioned your name as if I should recognize it, but I assure you that, beyond obvious facts that you are a bachelor, a solicitor, a Freemason, and an asthmatic, I know nothing whatever about you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14534' title='14534'>Familiar as I was with my friend's methods, it was not difficult for me to follow his deductions, and to observe the untidiness of attire, the sheaf of legal papers, the watch- charm, and the breathing which had prompted them. </span>
<span sid='14535' title='14535'>Our client, however, stared in amazement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14536' title='14536'>'Yes, I am all that, Mr Holmes, and in addition I am the most unfortunate man at this moment in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='14537' title='14537'>For God's sake don't abandon me, Mr Holmes! </span>
<span sid='14538' title='14538'>If they come to arrest me before I have finished my story, make them give me time, so that I may tell you the whole truth. </span>
<span sid='14539' title='14539'>I could go to gaol happy if I knew that you were working for me outside.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14540' title='14540'>'Arrest you!' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='14541' title='14541'>'This is really most grati - most interesting. </span>
<span sid='14542' title='14542'>On what charge do you expect to be arrested?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14543' title='14543'>'Upon the charge of murdering Mr Jonas Oldacre, of Lower <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a>?</span>
<p>
<span sid='14544' title='14544'>My companion's expressive face showed a sympathy which was not, I am afraid, entirely unmixed with satisfaction.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14545' title='14545'>'Dear me!' said he; 'it was only this moment at breakfast that I was saying to my friend, Dr Watson, that sensational cases had disappeared out of our papers.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14546' title='14546'>Our visitor stretched forward a quivering hand and picked up the Daily Telegraph, which still lay upon Holmes's knee.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14547' title='14547'>'If you had looked at it, sir, you would have seen at a glance what the errand is on which I have come to you this morning. </span>
<span sid='14548' title='14548'>I feel as if my name and my misfortune must be in every man's mouth.' </span>
<span sid='14549' title='14549'>He turned it over to expose the central page. </span>
<span sid='14550' title='14550'>'Here it is, and with your permission I will read it to you. </span>
<span sid='14551' title='14551'>Listen to this, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='14552' title='14552'>The headlines are: </span>
<span sid='14553' title='14553'>MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT LOWER NORWOOD. </span>
<span sid='14554' title='14554'>DISAPPEARANCE OF A WELL-KNOWN BUILDER. </span>
<span sid='14555' title='14555'>SUSPICION OF MURDER AND ARSON. </span>
<span sid='14556' title='14556'>A CLUE TO THE CRIMINAL. </span>
<span sid='14557' title='14557'>That is the clue which they are already following, Mr Holmes, and I know that it leads infallibly to me. </span>
<span sid='14558' title='14558'>I have been followed from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> Bridge Station, and I am sure that they are only waiting for the warrant to arrest me. </span>
<span sid='14559' title='14559'>It will break my mother's heart - it will break her heart!' </span>
<span sid='14560' title='14560'>He wrung his hands in an agony of apprehension, and swayed backwards and forwards in his chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14561' title='14561'>I looked with interest upon this man, who was accused of being the perpetrator of a crime of violence. </span>
<span sid='14562' title='14562'>He was flaxen-haired and handsome in a washed-out, negative fashion, with frightened blue eyes and a clean-shaven face, with a weak, sensitive mouth. </span>
<span sid='14563' title='14563'>His age may have been about twenty-seven; his dress and bearing, that of a gentleman. </span>
<span sid='14564' title='14564'>From the pocket of his light summer overcoat protruded the bundle of endorsed papers which proclaimed his profession.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14565' title='14565'>'We must use what time we have,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='14566' title='14566'>'Watson, would you have the kindness to take the paper and to read me the paragraph in question?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14567' title='14567'>Underneath the vigorous headlines which our client had quoted I read the following suggestive narrative:</span>
<p>
<span sid='14568' title='14568'>'Late last night, or early this morning, an incident occurred at Lower <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a> which points, it is feared, to a serious crime. </span>
<span sid='14569' title='14569'>Mr Jonas Oldacre is a well-known resident of that suburb, where he has carried on his business as a builder for many years. </span>
<span sid='14570' title='14570'>Mr Oldacre is a bachelor, fifty-two years of age, and lives in Deep Dene House, at the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sydenham&t=h'>Sydenham</a> end of the road of that name. </span>
<span sid='14571' title='14571'>He has had the reputation of being a man of eccentric habits, secretive and retiring. </span>
<span sid='14572' title='14572'>For some years he has practically withdrawn from the business, in which he is said to have amassed considerable wealth. </span>
<span sid='14573' title='14573'>A small timber-yard still exists, however, at the back of the house, and last night, about twelve o'clock, an alarm was given that one of the stacks was on fire. </span>
<span sid='14574' title='14574'>The engines were soon upon the spot, but the dry wood burned with great fury, and it was impossible to arrest the conflagration until the stack had been entirely consumed. </span>
<span sid='14575' title='14575'>Up to this point the incident bore the appearance of an ordinary accident, but fresh indications seem to point to serious crime. </span>
<span sid='14576' title='14576'>Surprise was expressed at the absence of the master of the establishment from the scene of the fire, and an inquiry followed, which showed that he had disappeared from the house. </span>
<span sid='14577' title='14577'>An examination of his room revealed that the bed had not been slept in, that a safe which stood in it was open, that a number of important papers were scattered about the room, and, finally, that there were signs of a murderous struggle, slight traces of blood being found within the room, and an oaken walking-stick which also showed stains of blood upon the handle. </span>
<span sid='14578' title='14578'>It is known that Mr Jonas Oldacre had received a late visitor in his bedroom upon that night, and the stick found has been identified as the property of this person, who is a young <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> solicitor named John Hector McFarlane, junior partner of Graham & McFarlane, of 426 <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Gresham Buildings&t=h'>Gresham Buildings</a>, EC. </span>
<span sid='14579' title='14579'>The police believe that they have evidence in their possession which supplies a very convincing motive for the crime, and altogether it cannot be doubted that sensational developments will follow.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14580' title='14580'>'LATER - It is rumoured as we go to press that Mr John Hector McFarlane has actually been arrested on the charge of the murder of Mr Jonas Oldacre. </span>
<span sid='14581' title='14581'>It is at least certain that a warrant has been issued. </span>
<span sid='14582' title='14582'>There have been further and sinister developments in the investigation at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a>. </span>
<span sid='14583' title='14583'>Besides the signs of a struggle in the room of the unfortunate builder, it is now known that the French windows of his bedroom (which is on the ground floor) were found to be open, that there were marks as if some bulky object had been dragged across to the wood-pile, and, finally, it is asserted that charred remains have been found among the charcoal ashes of the fire. </span>
<span sid='14584' title='14584'>The police theory is that a most sensational crime has been committed, that the victim was clubbed to death in his own bedroom, his papers rifled, and his dead body dragged across to the wood-stack, which was then ignited so as to hide all traces of the crime. </span>
<span sid='14585' title='14585'>The conduct of the criminal investigation has been left in the experienced hands of Inspector Lestrade, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>, who is following up the clues with his accustomed energy and sagacity.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14586' title='14586'>Sherlock Holmes listened with closed eyes and finger-tips together to this remarkable account.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14587' title='14587'>'The case has certainly some points of interest,' said he, in his languid fashion. </span>
<span sid='14588' title='14588'>'May I ask, in the first place, Mr McFarlane, how it is that you are still at liberty, since there appears to be enough evidence to justify your arrest?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14589' title='14589'>'I live at Torrington Lodge, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Blackheath&t=h'>Blackheath</a>, with my parents, Mr Holmes; but last night, having to do business very late with Mr Jonas Oldacre, I stayed at an hotel in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a>, and came to my business from there. </span>
<span sid='14590' title='14590'>I knew nothing of this affair until I was in the train, when I read what you have just heard. </span>
<span sid='14591' title='14591'>I at once saw the horrible danger of my position, and I hurried to put the case into your hands. </span>
<span sid='14592' title='14592'>I have no doubt that I should have been arrested either at my City office or at my home. </span>
<span sid='14593' title='14593'>A man followed me from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> Bridge Station, and I have no doubt - Great heaven, what is that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14594' title='14594'>It was a clang of the bell, followed instantly by heavy steps upon the stair. </span>
<span sid='14595' title='14595'>A moment later our old friend Lestrade appeared in the doorway. </span>
<span sid='14596' title='14596'>Over his shoulder I caught a glimpse of one or two uniformed policemen outside.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14597' title='14597'>'Mr John Hector McFarlane,' said Lestrade.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14598' title='14598'>Our unfortunate client rose with a ghastly face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14599' title='14599'>'I arrest you for the wilful murder of Mr Jonas Oldacre of Lower <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14600' title='14600'>McFarlane turned to us with a gesture of despair, and sank into his chair once more like one who is crushed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14601' title='14601'>'One moment, Lestrade,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='14602' title='14602'>'Half an hour more or less can make no difference to you, and the gentleman was about to give us an account of this very interesting affair, which might aid us in clearing it up.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14603' title='14603'>'I think there will be no difficulty in clearing it up,' said Lestrade grimly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14604' title='14604'>'None the less, with your permission, I should be much interested to hear his account.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14605' title='14605'>'Well, Mr Holmes, it is difficult for me to refuse you anything, for you have been of use to the Force once or twice in the past, and we owe you a good turn at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>,' said Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='14606' title='14606'>'At the same time, I must remain with my prisoner, and I am bound to warn him that anything he may say will appear in evidence against him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14607' title='14607'>'I wish nothing better,' said our client. </span>
<span sid='14608' title='14608'>'All I ask is that you should hear and recognize the absolute truth.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14609' title='14609'>Lestrade looked at his watch. </span>
<span sid='14610' title='14610'>'I'll give you half an hour,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14611' title='14611'>'I must explain first,' said McFarlane, 'that I knew nothing of Mr Jonas Oldacre. </span>
<span sid='14612' title='14612'>His name was familiar to me; for many years ago my parents were acquainted with him, but they drifted apart. </span>
<span sid='14613' title='14613'>I was very much surprised, therefore, when yesterday, about three o'clock in the afternoon, he walked into my office in the City. </span>
<span sid='14614' title='14614'>But I was still more astonished when he told me the object of his visit. </span>
<span sid='14615' title='14615'>He had in his hand several sheets of a note-book, covered with scribbled writing - here they are - and he laid them on my table.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14616' title='14616'>'"Here is my will," said he. </span>
<span sid='14617' title='14617'>"I want you, Mr McFarlane, to cast it into proper legal shape. </span>
<span sid='14618' title='14618'>I will sit here while you do so."</span>
<p>
<span sid='14619' title='14619'>'I set myself to copy it, and you can imagine my astonishment when I found that, with some reservations, he had left all his property to me. </span>
<span sid='14620' title='14620'>He was a strange, little, ferret-like man, with white eyelashes, and when I looked up at him I found his keen grey eyes fixed upon me with an amused expression. </span>
<span sid='14621' title='14621'>I could hardly believe my own senses as I read the terms of the will; but he explained that he was a bachelor with hardly any living relation, that he had known my parents in his youth, and that he had always heard of me as a very deserving young man, and was assured that his money would be in worthy hands. </span>
<span sid='14622' title='14622'>Of course, I could only stammer out my thanks. </span>
<span sid='14623' title='14623'>The will was duly finished, signed, and witnessed by my clerk. </span>
<span sid='14624' title='14624'>This is it on the blue paper, and these slips, as I have explained, are the rough draft. </span>
<span sid='14625' title='14625'>Mr Jonas Oldacre then informed me that there were a number of documents - building leases, title - deeds, mortgages, scrip, and so forth - which it was necessary that I should see and understand. </span>
<span sid='14626' title='14626'>He said that his mind would not be easy until the whole thing was settled, and he begged me to come out to his house at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a> that night, bringing the will with me, and to arrange matters. </span>
<span sid='14627' title='14627'>"Remember, my boy, not one word to your parents about the affair until everything is settled. </span>
<span sid='14628' title='14628'>We will keep it as a little surprise for them." </span>
<span sid='14629' title='14629'>He was very insistent upon this point, and made me promise it faithfully.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14630' title='14630'>'You can imagine, Mr Holmes, that I was not in a humour to refuse him anything that he might ask. </span>
<span sid='14631' title='14631'>He was my benefactor, and all my desire was to carry out his wishes in every particular. </span>
<span sid='14632' title='14632'>I sent a telegram home, therefore, to say that I had important business on hand, and that it was impossible for me to say how late I might be. </span>
<span sid='14633' title='14633'>Mr Oldacre had told me that he would like me to have supper with him at nine, as he might not be home before that hour. </span>
<span sid='14634' title='14634'>I had some difficulty in finding his house, however, and it was nearly half-past before I reached it. </span>
<span sid='14635' title='14635'>I found him-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14636' title='14636'>'One moment!' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='14637' title='14637'>'Who opened the door?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14638' title='14638'>'A middle-aged woman, who was, I suppose, his housekeeper.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14639' title='14639'>'And it was she, I presume, who mentioned your name?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14640' title='14640'>'Exactly,' said McFarlane.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14641' title='14641'>'Pray proceed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14642' title='14642'>Mr McFarlane wiped his damp brow, and then continued his narrative:</span>
<p>
<span sid='14643' title='14643'>'I was shown by this woman into a sitting-room, where a frugal supper was laid out. </span>
<span sid='14644' title='14644'>Afterwards Mr Jonas Oldacre led me into his bedroom, in which there stood a heavy safe. </span>
<span sid='14645' title='14645'>This he opened and took out a mass of documents, which we went over together. </span>
<span sid='14646' title='14646'>It was between eleven and twelve when we finished. </span>
<span sid='14647' title='14647'>He remarked that we must not disturb the housekeeper. </span>
<span sid='14648' title='14648'>He showed me out through his own French window, which had been open all this time.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14649' title='14649'>'Was the blind down?' asked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14650' title='14650'>'I will not be sure, but I believe that it was only half down. </span>
<span sid='14651' title='14651'>Yes, I remember how he pulled it up in order to swing open the window. </span>
<span sid='14652' title='14652'>I could not find my stick, and he said, "Never mind, my boy; I shall see a good deal of you now, I hope, and I will keep your stick until you come back to claim it." </span>
<span sid='14653' title='14653'>I left him there, the safe open, and the papers made up in packets upon the table. </span>
<span sid='14654' title='14654'>It was so late that I could not get back to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Blackheath&t=h'>Blackheath</a>, so I spent the night at the Anerley Arms, and I knew nothing more until I read of this horrible affair in the morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14655' title='14655'>'Anything more that you would like to ask, Mr Holmes?' said Lestrade, whose eyebrows had gone up once or twice during this remarkable explanation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14656' title='14656'>'Not until I have been to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Blackheath&t=h'>Blackheath</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14657' title='14657'>'You mean to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a>,' said Lestrade.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14658' title='14658'>'Oh, yes; no doubt that is what I must have meant,' said Holmes, with his enigmatical smile. </span>
<span sid='14659' title='14659'>Lestrade had learned by more experiences than he would care to acknowledge that that razor-like brain could cut through that which was impenetrable to him. </span>
<span sid='14660' title='14660'>I saw him look curiously at my companion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14661' title='14661'>'I think I should like to have a word with you presently, Mr Sherlock Holmes,' said he. </span>
<span sid='14662' title='14662'>'Now, Mr McFarlane, two of my constables are at the door, and there is a four-wheeler waiting.' </span>
<span sid='14663' title='14663'>The wretched young man arose, and with a last beseeching glance at us he walked from the room. </span>
<span sid='14664' title='14664'>The officers conducted him to the cab, but Lestrade remained.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14665' title='14665'>Holmes had picked up the pages which formed the rough draft of the will, and was looking at them with the keenest interest upon his face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14666' title='14666'>'There are some points about that document, Lestrade, are there not?' said he, pushing them over.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14667' title='14667'>The official looked at them with a puzzled expression.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14668' title='14668'>'I can read the first few lines, and these in the middle of the second page, and one or two at the end. </span>
<span sid='14669' title='14669'>Those are as clear as print,' said he; 'but the writing in between is very bad, and there are three places where I cannot read it at all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14670' title='14670'>'What do you make of that?' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14671' title='14671'>'Well, what do you make of it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14672' title='14672'>'That it was written in a train; the good writing represents stations, the bad writing, movement, and the very bad writing, passing over points. </span>
<span sid='14673' title='14673'>A scientific expert would pronounce at once that this was drawn up on a suburban line, since nowhere save in the immediate vicinity of a great city could there be so quick a succession of points. </span>
<span sid='14674' title='14674'>Granting that his whole journey was occupied in drawing up the will, then the train was an express, only stopping once between <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a> and <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> Bridge.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14675' title='14675'>Lestrade began to laugh.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14676' title='14676'>'You are too many for me when you begin to get on your theories, Mr Holmes,' said he. </span>
<span sid='14677' title='14677'>'How does this bear on the case?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14678' title='14678'>'Well, it corroborates the young man's story to the extent that the will was drawn up by Jonas Oldacre in his journey yesterday. </span>
<span sid='14679' title='14679'>It is curious - is it not? - that a man should draw up so important a document in so haphazard a fashion. </span>
<span sid='14680' title='14680'>It suggests that he did not think it was going to be of much practical importance. </span>
<span sid='14681' title='14681'>If a man drew up a will which he did not intend ever to be effective he might do it so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14682' title='14682'>'Well, he drew up his own death-warrant at the same time,' said Lestrade.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14683' title='14683'>'Oh, you think so?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14684' title='14684'>'Don't you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14685' title='14685'>'Well, it is quite possible; but the case is not clear to me yet.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14686' title='14686'>'Not clear? </span>
<span sid='14687' title='14687'>Well, if that isn't clear, what could be clearer? </span>
<span sid='14688' title='14688'>Here is a young man who learns suddenly that if a certain older man dies he will succeed to a fortune. </span>
<span sid='14689' title='14689'>What does he do? </span>
<span sid='14690' title='14690'>He says nothing to anyone, but he arranges that he shall go out on some pretext to see his client that night; he waits until the only other person in the house is in bed, and then in the solitude of the man's room he murders him, burns his body in the wood-pile, and departs to a neighbouring hotel. </span>
<span sid='14691' title='14691'>The blood-stains in the room and also on the stick are very slight. </span>
<span sid='14692' title='14692'>It is probable that he imagined his crime to be a bloodless one, and hoped that if the body were consumed it would hide all traces of the method of his death - traces which for some reason must have pointed to him. </span>
<span sid='14693' title='14693'>Is all this not obvious?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14694' title='14694'>'It strikes me, my good Lestrade, as being just a trifle too obvious,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='14695' title='14695'>'You do not add imagination to your other great qualities; but if you could for one moment put yourself in the place of this young man, would you choose the very night after the will had been made to commit your crime? </span>
<span sid='14696' title='14696'>Would it not seem dangerous to you to make so very close a relation between the two incidents? </span>
<span sid='14697' title='14697'>Again, would you choose an occasion when you are known to be in the house, when a servant has let you in? </span>
<span sid='14698' title='14698'>And, finally, would you take the great pains to conceal the body and yet leave your own stick as a sign that you were the criminal? </span>
<span sid='14699' title='14699'>Confess, Lestrade, that all this is very unlikely.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14700' title='14700'>'As to the stick, Mr Holmes, you know as well as I do that a criminal is often flurried and does things which a cool man would avoid. </span>
<span sid='14701' title='14701'>He was very likely afraid to go back to the room. </span>
<span sid='14702' title='14702'>Give me another theory that would fit the facts.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14703' title='14703'>'I could very easily give you half a dozen,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='14704' title='14704'>'Here, for example, is a very possible and even probable one. </span>
<span sid='14705' title='14705'>I make you a free present of it. </span>
<span sid='14706' title='14706'>The older man is showing documents which are of evident value. </span>
<span sid='14707' title='14707'>A passing tramp sees them through the window, the blind of which is only half down. </span>
<span sid='14708' title='14708'>Exit the solicitor. </span>
<span sid='14709' title='14709'>Enter the tramp! </span>
<span sid='14710' title='14710'>He seizes a stick, which he observes there, kills Oldacre, and departs after burning the body.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14711' title='14711'>'Why should the tramp burn the body?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14712' title='14712'>'For the matter of that, why should McFarlane?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14713' title='14713'>'To hide some evidence.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14714' title='14714'>'Possibly the tramp wanted to hide that any murder at all had been committed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14715' title='14715'>'And why did the tramp take nothing?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14716' title='14716'>'Because they were papers that he could not negotiate.' </span>
<span sid='14717' title='14717'>Lestrade shook his head, though it seemed to me that his manner was less absolutely assured than before.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14718' title='14718'>'Well, Mr Sherlock Holmes, you may look for your tramp, and while you are finding him we will hold on to our man. </span>
<span sid='14719' title='14719'>The future will show which is right. </span>
<span sid='14720' title='14720'>Just notice this point, Mr Holmes - that so far as we know none of the papers were removed, and that the prisoner is the one man in the world who had no reason for removing them since he was heir-at-law and would come into them in any case.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14721' title='14721'>My friend seemed struck by this remark.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14722' title='14722'>'I don't mean to deny that the evidence is in some ways very strongly in favour of your theory,' said he. </span>
<span sid='14723' title='14723'>'I only wish to point out that there are other theories possible. </span>
<span sid='14724' title='14724'>As you say, the future will decide. </span>
<span sid='14725' title='14725'>Good morning! </span>
<span sid='14726' title='14726'>I dare say that in the course of the day I shall drop in at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a> and see how you are getting on.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14727' title='14727'>When the detective departed my friend rose and made his preparations for the day's work with the alert air of a man who has a congenial task before him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14728' title='14728'>'My first movement, Watson,' said he, as he bustled into his frock-coat, 'must, as I said, be in the direction of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Blackheath&t=h'>Blackheath</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14729' title='14729'>'And why not <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a>?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14730' title='14730'>'Because we have in this case one singular incident coming close to the heels of another singular incident. </span>
<span sid='14731' title='14731'>The police are making the mistake of concentrating their attention upon the second because it happens to be the one which is actually criminal. </span>
<span sid='14732' title='14732'>But it is evident to me that the logical way to approach the case is to begin by trying to throw some light upon the first incident - the curious will, so suddenly made, and to so unexpected an heir. </span>
<span sid='14733' title='14733'>It may do something to simplify what followed. </span>
<span sid='14734' title='14734'>No, my dear fellow, I don't think you can help me. </span>
<span sid='14735' title='14735'>There is no prospect of danger, or I should not dream of stirring out without you. </span>
<span sid='14736' title='14736'>I trust that when I see you in the evening I will be able to report that I have been able to do something for this unfortunate youngster who has thrown himself upon my protection.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14737' title='14737'>It was late when my friend returned, and I could see by a glance at his haggard and anxious face that the high hopes with which he had started had not been fulfilled. </span>
<span sid='14738' title='14738'>For an hour he droned away upon his violin, endeavouring to soothe his own ruffled spirits. </span>
<span sid='14739' title='14739'>At last he flung down the instrument and plunged into a detailed account of his misadventures.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14740' title='14740'>'It's all going wrong, Watson - all as wrong as it can go. </span>
<span sid='14741' title='14741'>I kept a bold face before Lestrade, but, upon my soul, I believe that for once the fellow is on the right track and we are on the wrong. </span>
<span sid='14742' title='14742'>All my instincts are one way, and all the facts are the other, and I much fear that British juries have not yet attained that pitch of intelligence when they will give the preference to my theories over Lestrade's facts.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14743' title='14743'>'Did you go to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Blackheath&t=h'>Blackheath</a>?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14744' title='14744'>'Yes, Watson, I went there, and I found very quickly that the late lamented Oldacre was a pretty considerable blackguard. </span>
<span sid='14745' title='14745'>The father was away in search of his son. </span>
<span sid='14746' title='14746'>The mother was at home - a little, fluffy, blue-eyed person, in a tremor of fear and indignation. </span>
<span sid='14747' title='14747'>Of course, she would not admit even the possibility of his guilt. </span>
<span sid='14748' title='14748'>But she would not express either surprise or regret over the fate of Oldacre. </span>
<span sid='14749' title='14749'>On the contrary, she spoke of him with such bitterness that she was unconsciously considerably strengthening the case of the police; for, of course, if the son had heard her speak of the man in that fashion it would predispose him towards hatred and violence. </span>
<span sid='14750' title='14750'>"He was more like a malignant and cunning ape than a human being," said she, "and he always was, ever since he was a young man."</span>
<p>
<span sid='14751' title='14751'>'"You knew him at the time?" said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14752' title='14752'>'"Yes, I knew him well; in fact, he was an old suitor of mine. </span>
<span sid='14753' title='14753'>Thank God that I had the sense to turn away from him and to marry a better, if a poorer, man. </span>
<span sid='14754' title='14754'>I was engaged to him, Mr Holmes, when I heard a shocking story of how he had turned a cat loose in an aviary, and I was so horrified at his brutal cruelty that I would have nothing more to do with him." </span>
<span sid='14755' title='14755'>She rummaged in a bureau, and presently she produced a photograph of a woman, shamefully defaced and mutilated with a knife. </span>
<span sid='14756' title='14756'>"That is my own photograph," said she. </span>
<span sid='14757' title='14757'>"He sent it to me in that state, with his curse, upon my wedding morning."</span>
<p>
<span sid='14758' title='14758'>'"Well," said I, "at least he has forgiven you now, since he has left all his property to your son."</span>
<p>
<span sid='14759' title='14759'>'"Neither my son nor I want anything from Jonas Oldacre, dead or alive," she cried, with a proper spirit. </span>
<span sid='14760' title='14760'>"There is a God in heaven, Mr Holmes, and that same God who has punished that wicked man will show in His own good time that my son's hands are guiltless of his blood."</span>
<p>
<span sid='14761' title='14761'>'Well, I tried one or two leads, but could get at nothing which would help our hypothesis, and several points which would make against it. </span>
<span sid='14762' title='14762'>I gave it up at last, and off I went to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14763' title='14763'>'This place, Deep Dene House, is a big modern villa of staring brick, standing back in its own grounds, with a laurel-clumped lawn in front of it. </span>
<span sid='14764' title='14764'>To the right and some distance back from the road was the timber-yard which had been the scene of the fire. </span>
<span sid='14765' title='14765'>Here's a rough plan on a leaf of my note-book. </span>
<span sid='14766' title='14766'>This window on the left is the one which opens into Oldacre's room. </span>
<span sid='14767' title='14767'>You can look into it from the road, you see. </span>
<span sid='14768' title='14768'>That is about the only bit of consolation I have had to-day. </span>
<span sid='14769' title='14769'>Lestrade was not there, but his head constable did the honours. </span>
<span sid='14770' title='14770'>They had just made a great treasure-trove. </span>
<span sid='14771' title='14771'>They had spent the morning raking among the ashes of the burned wood-pile and besides the charred organic remains they had secured several discoloured metal discs. </span>
<span sid='14772' title='14772'>I examined them with care, and there was no doubt that they were trouser buttons. </span>
<span sid='14773' title='14773'>I even distinguished that one of them was marked with the name of "Hyams", who was Oldacre's tailor. </span>
<span sid='14774' title='14774'>I then worked the lawn very carefully for signs and traces, but this drought has made everything as hard as iron. </span>
<span sid='14775' title='14775'>Nothing was to be seen save that somebody or a bundle had been dragged through a low privet hedge which is in a line with the wood-pile. </span>
<span sid='14776' title='14776'>All that, of course, fits in with the official theory. </span>
<span sid='14777' title='14777'>I crawled about the lawn with an August sun on my back. </span>
<span sid='14778' title='14778'>But I got up at the end of an hour no wiser than before.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14779' title='14779'>'Well, after this fiasco I went into the bedroom and examined that also. </span>
<span sid='14780' title='14780'>The blood-stains were very slight, mere smears and discolorations, but undoubtedly fresh. </span>
<span sid='14781' title='14781'>The stick had been removed, but there also the marks were slight. </span>
<span sid='14782' title='14782'>There is no doubt about the stick belonging to our client. </span>
<span sid='14783' title='14783'>He admits it. </span>
<span sid='14784' title='14784'>Footmarks of both men could be made out on the carpet, but none of any third person, which again is a trick for the other side. </span>
<span sid='14785' title='14785'>They were piling up their score all the time, and we were at a standstill.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14786' title='14786'>'Only one little gleam of hope did I get - and yet it amounted to nothing. </span>
<span sid='14787' title='14787'>I examined the contents of the safe, most of which had been taken out and left on the table. </span>
<span sid='14788' title='14788'>The papers had been made up into sealed envelopes, one or two of which had been opened by the police. </span>
<span sid='14789' title='14789'>They were not, so far as I could judge, of any great value, nor did the bankbook show that Mr Oldacre was in such very affluent circumstances. </span>
<span sid='14790' title='14790'>But it seemed to me that all the papers were not there. </span>
<span sid='14791' title='14791'>There were allusions to some deeds - possibly the more valuable - which I could not find. </span>
<span sid='14792' title='14792'>This, of course, if we could definitely prove it, would turn Lestrade's argument against himself, for who would steal a thing if he knew that he would shortly inherit it?</span>
<p>
<span sid='14793' title='14793'>'Finally, having drawn every other cover and picked up no scent, I tried my luck with the housekeeper. </span>
<span sid='14794' title='14794'>Mrs Lexington is her name, a little, dark, silent person, with suspicious and sidelong eyes. </span>
<span sid='14795' title='14795'>She could tell us something if she would — I am convinced of it. </span>
<span sid='14796' title='14796'>But she was as close as wax. </span>
<span sid='14797' title='14797'>Yes, she had let Mr McFarlane in at half-past nine. </span>
<span sid='14798' title='14798'>She wished her hand had withered before she had done so. </span>
<span sid='14799' title='14799'>She had gone to bed at half-past ten. </span>
<span sid='14800' title='14800'>Her room was at the other end of the house, and she could hear nothing of what passed. </span>
<span sid='14801' title='14801'>Mr McFarlane had left his hat, and to the best of her belief his stick, in the hall. </span>
<span sid='14802' title='14802'>She had been awakened by the alarm of fire. </span>
<span sid='14803' title='14803'>Her poor, dear master had certainly been murdered. </span>
<span sid='14804' title='14804'>Had he any enemies? </span>
<span sid='14805' title='14805'>Well, every man had enemies, but Mr Oldacre kept himself very much to himself, and only met people in the way of business. </span>
<span sid='14806' title='14806'>She had seen the buttons, and was sure that they belonged to the clothes which he had worn last night. </span>
<span sid='14807' title='14807'>The wood-pile was very dry, for it had not rained for a month. </span>
<span sid='14808' title='14808'>It burned like a tinder, and by the time she reached the spot nothing could be seen but flames. </span>
<span sid='14809' title='14809'>She and all the firemen smelled the burned flesh from inside it. </span>
<span sid='14810' title='14810'>She knew nothing of the papers, nor of Mr Oldacre's private affairs.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14811' title='14811'>'So, my dear Watson, there's my report of a failure. </span>
<span sid='14812' title='14812'>And yet - and yet' - he clenched his thin hands in a paroxysm of conviction - I know it's all wrong. </span>
<span sid='14813' title='14813'>I feel it in my bones. </span>
<span sid='14814' title='14814'>There is something that has not come out, and that housekeeper knows it. </span>
<span sid='14815' title='14815'>There was a sort of sulky defiance in here yes which only goes with guilty knowledge. </span>
<span sid='14816' title='14816'>However, there's no good talking any more about it, Watson; but unless some lucky chance comes our way I fear that the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a> Disappearance Case will not figure in that chronicle of our successes which I foresee that a patient public will sooner or later have to endure.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14817' title='14817'>'Surely,' said I, 'the man's appearance would go far with any jury?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14818' title='14818'>'That is a dangerous argument, my dear Watson. </span>
<span sid='14819' title='14819'>You remember that terrible murderer, Bert Stevens, who wanted us to get him off in '87? </span>
<span sid='14820' title='14820'>Was there ever a more mild- mannered, Sunday-school young man?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14821' title='14821'>'It is true.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14822' title='14822'>'Unless we succeed in establishing an alternative theory, this man is lost. </span>
<span sid='14823' title='14823'>You can hardly find a flaw in the case which can now be presented against him, and all further investigation has served to strengthen it. </span>
<span sid='14824' title='14824'>By the way, there is one curious little point about those papers which may serve us as the starting-point for an inquiry. </span>
<span sid='14825' title='14825'>On looking over the bank book I found that the low state of the balance was principally due to large cheques which have been made out during the last year to Mr Cornelius. </span>
<span sid='14826' title='14826'>I confess that I should be interested to know who this Mr Cornelius may be with whom a retired builder has such very large transactions. </span>
<span sid='14827' title='14827'>Is it possible that he has had a hand in the affair? </span>
<span sid='14828' title='14828'>Cornelius might be a broker, but we have found no scrip to correspond with these large payments. </span>
<span sid='14829' title='14829'>Failing any other indication, my researches must now take the direction of an inquiry at the bank for the gentleman who has cashed these cheques. </span>
<span sid='14830' title='14830'>But I fear, my dear fellow, that our case will end ingloriously by Lestrade hanging our client, which will certainly be a triumph for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14831' title='14831'>I do not know how far Sherlock Holmes took any sleep that night, but when I came down to breakfast I found him pale and harassed, his bright eyes the brighter for the dark shadows round them. </span>
<span sid='14832' title='14832'>The carpet round his chair was littered with cigarette ends and with the early editions of the morning papers. </span>
<span sid='14833' title='14833'>An open telegram lay upon the table.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14834' title='14834'>'What do you think of this, Watson?' he asked, tossing it across.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14835' title='14835'>It was from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a>, and ran as follows:</span>
<p>
<span sid='14836' title='14836'>IMPORTANT FRESH EVIDENCE TO HAND. </span>
<span sid='14837' title='14837'>MCFARLANE'S GUILT DEFINITELY ESTABLISHED. </span>
<span sid='14838' title='14838'>ADVISE YOU TO ABANDON CASE. </span>
<span sid='14839' title='14839'>LESTRADE</span>
<p>
<span sid='14840' title='14840'>'This sounds serious,' said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14841' title='14841'>It is Lestrade's little cock-a-doodle of victory,' Holmes answered, with a bitter smile. </span>
<span sid='14842' title='14842'>'And yet it may be premature to abandon the case. </span>
<span sid='14843' title='14843'>After all, important fresh evidence is a two-edged thing, and may possibly cut in a very different direction to that which Lestrade imagines. </span>
<span sid='14844' title='14844'>Take your breakfast, Watson, and we will go out together and see what we can do. </span>
<span sid='14845' title='14845'>I feel as if I shall need your company and your moral support to-day.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14846' title='14846'>My friend had no breakfast himself, for it was one of his peculiarities that in his more intense moments he would permit himself no food, and I have known him presume upon his iron strength until he has fainted from pure inanition. </span>
<span sid='14847' title='14847'>'At present I cannot spare energy and nerve force for digestion,' he would say, in answer to my medical remonstrances. </span>
<span sid='14848' title='14848'>I was not surprised, therefore, when this morning he left his untouched meal behind him and started with me for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a>. </span>
<span sid='14849' title='14849'>A crowd of morbid sightseers were still gathered round Deep Dene House, which was just such a suburban villa as I had pictured. </span>
<span sid='14850' title='14850'>Within the gates Lestrade met us, his face flushed with victory, his manner grossly triumphant.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14851' title='14851'>'Well, Mr Holmes, have you proved us to be wrong yet? </span>
<span sid='14852' title='14852'>Have you found your tramp?' he cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14853' title='14853'>'I have formed no conclusion whatever,' my companion answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14854' title='14854'>'But we formed ours yesterday, and now it proves to be correct; so you must acknowledge that we have been a little in front of you this time, Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14855' title='14855'>'You certainly have the air of something unusual having occurred,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14856' title='14856'>Lestrade laughed loudly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14857' title='14857'>'You don't like being beaten any more than the rest of us do,' said he. </span>
<span sid='14858' title='14858'>'A man can't expect always to have it his own way - can he, Dr Watson? </span>
<span sid='14859' title='14859'>Step this way, if you please, gentlemen, and I think I can convince you once for all that it was John McFarlane who did this crime.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14860' title='14860'>He led us through the passage and out into a dark hall beyond.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14861' title='14861'>'This is where young McFarlane must have come out to get his hat after the crime was done,' said he. </span>
<span sid='14862' title='14862'>'Now look at this.' </span>
<span sid='14863' title='14863'>With dramatic suddenness he struck a match, and by its light exposed a stain of blood upon the whitewashed wall. </span>
<span sid='14864' title='14864'>As he held the match nearer I saw that it was more than a stain. </span>
<span sid='14865' title='14865'>It was the well-marked print of a thumb.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14866' title='14866'>'Look at that with your magnifying glass, Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14867' title='14867'>'Yes, I am doing so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14868' title='14868'>'You are aware that no two thumb-marks are alike?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14869' title='14869'>'I have heard something of the kind.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14870' title='14870'>'Well, then, will you please compare that print with this wax impression of young McFarlane's right thumb, taken by my orders this morning?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14871' title='14871'>As he held the waxen print close to the blood-stain it did not take a magnifying glass to see that the two were undoubtedly from the same thumb. </span>
<span sid='14872' title='14872'>It was evident to me that our unfortunate client was lost.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14873' title='14873'>'That is final,' said Lestrade.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14874' title='14874'>'Yes, that is final,' I involuntarily echoed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14875' title='14875'>'It is final,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14876' title='14876'>Something in his tone caught my ear, and I turned to look at him. </span>
<span sid='14877' title='14877'>An extraordinary change had come over his face. </span>
<span sid='14878' title='14878'>It was writhing with inward merriment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14879' title='14879'>His two eyes were shining like stars. </span>
<span sid='14880' title='14880'>It seemed to me that he was making desperate efforts to restrain a convulsive attack of laughter.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14881' title='14881'>'Dear me! </span>
<span sid='14882' title='14882'>Dear me!' he said at last. </span>
<span sid='14883' title='14883'>'Well, now, who would have thought it? </span>
<span sid='14884' title='14884'>And how deceptive appearances may be, to be sure! </span>
<span sid='14885' title='14885'>Such a nice young man to look at! </span>
<span sid='14886' title='14886'>It is a lesson to us not to trust our own judgement - is it not, Lestrade?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14887' title='14887'>'Yes, some of us are a little too much inclined to be cock-sure, Mr Holmes,' said Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='14888' title='14888'>The man's insolence was maddening, but we could not resent it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14889' title='14889'>'What a providential thing that this young man should press his right thumb against the wall in taking his hat from the peg! </span>
<span sid='14890' title='14890'>Such a very natural action, too, if you come to think of it.' </span>
<span sid='14891' title='14891'>Holmes was outwardly calm, but his whole body gave a wriggle of suppressed excitement as he spoke. </span>
<span sid='14892' title='14892'>'By the way, Lestrade, who made this remarkable discovery?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14893' title='14893'>'It was the housekeeper, Mrs Lexington, who drew the night constable's attention to it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14894' title='14894'>'Where was the night constable?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14895' title='14895'>'He remained on guard in the bedroom where the crime was committed, so as to see that nothing was touched.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14896' title='14896'>'But why didn't the police see this mark yesterday?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14897' title='14897'>'Well, we had no particular reason to make a careful examination of the hall. </span>
<span sid='14898' title='14898'>Besides, it's not in a very prominent place, as you see.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14899' title='14899'>'No, no, of course not. </span>
<span sid='14900' title='14900'>I suppose there is no doubt that the mark was there yesterday?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14901' title='14901'>Lestrade looked at Holmes as if he thought he was going out of his mind. </span>
<span sid='14902' title='14902'>I confess that I was myself surprised both at his hilarious manner and at his rather wild observation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14903' title='14903'>'I don't know whether you think that McFarlane came out of gaol in the dead of the night in order to strengthen the evidence against himself,' said Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='14904' title='14904'>'I leave it to any expert in the world whether that is not the mark of his thumb.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14905' title='14905'>'It is unquestionably the mark of his thumb.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14906' title='14906'>'There, that's enough,' said Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='14907' title='14907'>'I am a practical man, Mr Holmes, and when I have got my evidence I come to my conclusions. </span>
<span sid='14908' title='14908'>If you have anything to say you will find me writing my report in the sitting-room.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14909' title='14909'>Holmes had recovered his equanimity, though I still seemed to detect gleams of amusement in his expression.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14910' title='14910'>'Dear me, this is a very sad development, Watson, is it not?' said he. </span>
<span sid='14911' title='14911'>And yet there are singular points about it which hold out some hopes for our client.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14912' title='14912'>'I am delighted to hear it,' said I heartily. </span>
<span sid='14913' title='14913'>'I was afraid it was all up with him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14914' title='14914'>'I would hardly go so far as to say that, my dear Watson. </span>
<span sid='14915' title='14915'>The fact is that there is one really serious flaw in this evidence to which our friend attaches so much importance.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14916' title='14916'>'Indeed, Holmes! </span>
<span sid='14917' title='14917'>What is it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14918' title='14918'>'Only this - that I know that that mark was not there when I examined the hall yesterday. </span>
<span sid='14919' title='14919'>And now, Watson, let us have a little stroll round in the sunshine.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14920' title='14920'>With a confused brain, but with a heart into which some warmth of hope was returning, I accompanied my friend in a walk round the garden. </span>
<span sid='14921' title='14921'>Holmes took each face of the house in turn and examined it with great interest. </span>
<span sid='14922' title='14922'>He then led the way inside, and went over the whole building from basement to attics. </span>
<span sid='14923' title='14923'>Most of the rooms were unfurnished, but none the less Holmes inspected them all minutely. </span>
<span sid='14924' title='14924'>Finally, on the top corridor, which ran outside three untenanted bedrooms, he again was seized with a spasm of merriment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14925' title='14925'>'There are really some very unique features about this case, Watson,' said he. </span>
<span sid='14926' title='14926'>'I think it is time now that we took our friend Lestrade into our confidence. </span>
<span sid='14927' title='14927'>He has had his little smile at our expense, and perhaps we may do as much by him if my reading of this problem proves to be correct. </span>
<span sid='14928' title='14928'>Yes, yes; I think I see how we should approach it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14929' title='14929'>The <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a> inspector was still writing in the parlour when Holmes interrupted him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14930' title='14930'>'I understood that you were writing a report of this case,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14931' title='14931'>'So I am.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14932' title='14932'>'Don't you think it may be a little premature? </span>
<span sid='14933' title='14933'>I can't help thinking that your evidence is not complete.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14934' title='14934'>Lestrade knew my friend too well to disregard his words. </span>
<span sid='14935' title='14935'>He laid down his pen and looked curiously at him. </span>
<span sid='14936' title='14936'>'What do you mean, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14937' title='14937'>'Only that there is an important witness whom you have not seen.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14938' title='14938'>'Can you produce him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14939' title='14939'>'I think I can.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14940' title='14940'>'Then do so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14941' title='14941'>'I will do my best. </span>
<span sid='14942' title='14942'>How many constables have you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14943' title='14943'>'There are three within call.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14944' title='14944'>'Excellent!' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='14945' title='14945'>'May I ask if they are all large, able-bodied men with powerful voices?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14946' title='14946'>'I have no doubt they are, though I fail to see what their voices have to do with it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14947' title='14947'>'Perhaps I can help you to see that, and one or two other things as well,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='14948' title='14948'>'Kindly summon your men, and I will try.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14949' title='14949'>Five minutes later three policemen had assembled in the hall.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14950' title='14950'>'In the outhouse you will find a considerable quantity of straw,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='14951' title='14951'>'I will ask you to carry in two bundles of it. </span>
<span sid='14952' title='14952'>I think it will be of the greatest assistance in producing the witness whom I require. </span>
<span sid='14953' title='14953'>Thank you very much. </span>
<span sid='14954' title='14954'>I believe you have some matches in your pocket, Watson. </span>
<span sid='14955' title='14955'>Now, Mr Lestrade, I will ask you all to accompany me to the top landing.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14956' title='14956'>As I have said, there was a broad corridor there, which ran outside three empty bedrooms. </span>
<span sid='14957' title='14957'>At one end of the corridor we were all marshalled by Sherlock Holmes, the constables grinning, and Lestrade staring at my friend with amazement, expectation, and derision chasing each other across his features. </span>
<span sid='14958' title='14958'>Holmes stood before us with an air of a conjurer who is performing a trick.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14959' title='14959'>'Would you kindly send one of your constables for two buckets of water? </span>
<span sid='14960' title='14960'>Put the straw on the floor here, free from the wall on either side. </span>
<span sid='14961' title='14961'>Now I think that we are all ready.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14962' title='14962'>Lestrade's face had begun to grow red and angry.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14963' title='14963'>'I don't know whether you are playing a game with us, Mr Sherlock Holmes,' said he. </span>
<span sid='14964' title='14964'>'If you know anything, you can surely say it without all this tomfoolery.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14965' title='14965'>'I assure you, my good Lestrade, that I have an excellent reason for everything that I do. </span>
<span sid='14966' title='14966'>You may possibly remember that you chaffed me a little some hours ago, when the sun seemed on your side of the hedge, so you must not grudge me a little pomp and ceremony now. </span>
<span sid='14967' title='14967'>Might I ask you, Watson, to open that window, and then to put a match to the edge of the straw?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14968' title='14968'>I did so, and, driven by the draught, a coil of grey smoke swirled down the corridor, while the dry straw crackled and flamed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14969' title='14969'>'Now we must see if we can find this witness for you, Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='14970' title='14970'>Might I ask you all to join in the cry of "Fire"? </span>
<span sid='14971' title='14971'>Now, then: one, two, three-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14972' title='14972'>'Fire!' we all yelled.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14973' title='14973'>'Thank you. </span>
<span sid='14974' title='14974'>I will trouble you once again.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14975' title='14975'>'Fire!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14976' title='14976'>'Just once more, gentlemen, and all together.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14977' title='14977'>'Fire!' </span>
<span sid='14978' title='14978'>The shout must have rung over <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14979' title='14979'>It had hardly died away when an amazing thing happened. </span>
<span sid='14980' title='14980'>A door suddenly flew open out of what appeared to be solid wall at the end of the corridor, and a little wizened man darted out of it, like a rabbit out of its burrow.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14981' title='14981'>'Capital!' said Holmes calmly. </span>
<span sid='14982' title='14982'>'Watson, a bucket of water over the straw. </span>
<span sid='14983' title='14983'>That will do! </span>
<span sid='14984' title='14984'>Lestrade, allow me to present you with your principal missing witness, Mr Jonas Oldacre.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14985' title='14985'>The detective stared at the newcomer with blank amazement. </span>
<span sid='14986' title='14986'>The latter was blinking in the bright light of the corridor, and peering at us and at the smouldering fire. </span>
<span sid='14987' title='14987'>It was an odious face - crafty, vicious, malignant, with shifty, light-grey eyes and white eyelashes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14988' title='14988'>'What's this, then?' said Lestrade at last. </span>
<span sid='14989' title='14989'>'What have you been doing all this time, eh?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14990' title='14990'>Oldacre gave an uneasy laugh, shrinking back from the furious red face of the angry detective.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14991' title='14991'>'I have done no harm.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14992' title='14992'>'No harm? </span>
<span sid='14993' title='14993'>You have done your best to get an innocent man hanged. </span>
<span sid='14994' title='14994'>If it wasn't for this gentleman here, I am not sure that you would not have succeeded.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14995' title='14995'>The wretched creature began to whimper.</span>
<p>
<span sid='14996' title='14996'>'I am sure, sir, it was only my practical joke.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='14997' title='14997'>'Oh! a joke, was it? </span>
<span sid='14998' title='14998'>You won't find the laugh on your side, I promise you. </span>
<span sid='14999' title='14999'>Take him down and keep him in the sitting-room until I come. </span>
<span sid='15000' title='15000'>Mr Holmes,' he continued, when they had gone, 'I could not speak before the constables, but I don't mind saying, in the presence of Dr Watson, that this is the brightest thing that you have done yet, though it is a mystery to me how you did it. </span>
<span sid='15001' title='15001'>You have saved an innocent man's life, and you have prevented a very grave scandal, which would have ruined my reputation in the Force.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15002' title='15002'>Holmes smiled and clapped Lestrade upon the shoulder.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15003' title='15003'>'Instead of being ruined, my good sir, you will find that your reputation has been enormously enhanced. </span>
<span sid='15004' title='15004'>Just make a few alterations in that report which you were writing, and they will understand how hard it is to throw dust in the eyes of Inspector Lestrade.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15005' title='15005'>'And you don't want your name to appear?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15006' title='15006'>'Not at all. </span>
<span sid='15007' title='15007'>The work is its own reward. </span>
<span sid='15008' title='15008'>Perhaps I shall get the credit also at some distant day when I permit my zealous historian to lay out his foolscap once more - eh, Watson? </span>
<span sid='15009' title='15009'>Well, now, let us see where this rat has been lurking.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15010' title='15010'>A lath-and-plaster partition had been run across the passage six feet from the end, with a door cunningly concealed in it. </span>
<span sid='15011' title='15011'>It was lit within by slits under the eaves. </span>
<span sid='15012' title='15012'>A few articles of furniture and a supply of food and water were within, together with a number of books and papers.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15013' title='15013'>'There's the advantage of being a builder,' said Holmes as we came out. </span>
<span sid='15014' title='15014'>'He was able to fix up his own little hiding- place without any confederate - save, of course, that precious housekeeper of his, whom I should lose no time in adding to your bag, Lestrade.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15015' title='15015'>'I will take your advice. </span>
<span sid='15016' title='15016'>But how did you know of this place, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15017' title='15017'>'I made up my mind that the fellow was in hiding in the house. </span>
<span sid='15018' title='15018'>When I paced one corridor and found it six feet shorter than the corresponding one below, it was pretty clear where he was. </span>
<span sid='15019' title='15019'>I thought he had not the nerve to lie quiet before an alarm of fire. </span>
<span sid='15020' title='15020'>We could, of course, have gone in and taken him, but it amused me to make him reveal himself; besides, I owed you a little mystification, Lestrade, for your chaff in the morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15021' title='15021'>'Well, sir, you certainly got equal with me on that. </span>
<span sid='15022' title='15022'>But how in the world did you know that he was in the house at all?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15023' title='15023'>'The thumb-mark, Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='15024' title='15024'>You said it was final; and so it was, in a very different sense. </span>
<span sid='15025' title='15025'>I knew it had not been there the day before. </span>
<span sid='15026' title='15026'>I pay a good deal of attention to matters of detail, as you may have observed, and I had examined the hall, and was sure that the wall was clear. </span>
<span sid='15027' title='15027'>Therefore, it had been put on during the night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15028' title='15028'>'But how?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15029' title='15029'>'Very simply. </span>
<span sid='15030' title='15030'>When those packets were sealed up, Jonas Oldacre got McFarlane to secure one of the seals by putting his thumb upon the soft wax. </span>
<span sid='15031' title='15031'>It would be done so quickly and so naturally that I dare say the young man himself has no recollection of it. </span>
<span sid='15032' title='15032'>Very likely it just so happened, and Oldacre had himself no notion of the use he would put it to. </span>
<span sid='15033' title='15033'>Brooding over the case in that den of his, it suddenly struck him what absolutely damning evidence he could make against McFarlane by using that thumb-mark. </span>
<span sid='15034' title='15034'>It was the simplest thing in the world for him to take a wax impression from the seal, to moisten it in as much blood as he could get from a pin-prick, and to put the mark upon the wall during the night, either with his own hand or with that of his housekeeper. </span>
<span sid='15035' title='15035'>If you examine among these documents which he took with him into his retreat, I will lay you a wager that you find the seal with the thumb-mark upon it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15036' title='15036'>'Wonderful!' said Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='15037' title='15037'>'Wonderful! </span>
<span sid='15038' title='15038'>It's all as clear as crystal, as you put it. </span>
<span sid='15039' title='15039'>But what is the object of this deep deception, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15040' title='15040'>It was amusing to me to see how the detective's overbearing manner had changed suddenly to that of a child asking questions of its teacher.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15041' title='15041'>'Well, I don't think that is very hard to explain. </span>
<span sid='15042' title='15042'>A very deep, malicious, vindictive person is the gentleman who is now awaiting us downstairs. </span>
<span sid='15043' title='15043'>You know that he was once refused by McFarlane's mother? </span>
<span sid='15044' title='15044'>You don't! </span>
<span sid='15045' title='15045'>I told you that you should go to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Blackheath&t=h'>Blackheath</a> first and <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norwood&t=h'>Norwood</a> afterwards. </span>
<span sid='15046' title='15046'>Well, this injury, as he would consider it, has rankled in his wicked, scheming brain, and all his life he has longed for vengeance, but never seen his chance. </span>
<span sid='15047' title='15047'>During the last year or two things have gone against him - secret speculation, I think - and he finds himself in a bad way. </span>
<span sid='15048' title='15048'>He determines to swindle his creditors, and for this purpose he pays large cheques to a certain Mr Cornelius, who is, I imagine, himself under another name. </span>
<span sid='15049' title='15049'>I have not traced these cheques yet, but I have no doubt that they were banked under that name at some provincial town where Oldacre from time to time led a double existence. </span>
<span sid='15050' title='15050'>He intended to change his name altogether, draw this money, and vanish, starting life again elsewhere.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15051' title='15051'>'Well, that's likely enough.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15052' title='15052'>'It would strike him that in disappearing he might throw all pursuit off his track, and at the same time have an ample and crushing revenge upon his old sweetheart, if he could give the impression that he had been murdered by her only child. </span>
<span sid='15053' title='15053'>It was a masterpiece of villainy, and he carried it out like a master. </span>
<span sid='15054' title='15054'>The idea of the will, which would give an obvious motive for the crime, the secret visit unknown to his own parents, the retention of the stick, the blood, and the animal remains and buttons in the wood-pile, all were admirable. </span>
<span sid='15055' title='15055'>It was a net from which it seemed to me a few hours ago that there was no possible escape. </span>
<span sid='15056' title='15056'>But he had not that supreme gift of the artist, the knowledge of when to stop. </span>
<span sid='15057' title='15057'>He wished to improve that which was already perfect - to draw the rope tighter yet round the neck of his unfortunate victim - and so he ruined all. </span>
<span sid='15058' title='15058'>Let us descend, Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='15059' title='15059'>There are just one or two questions that I would ask him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15060' title='15060'>The malignant creature was seated in his own parlour with a policeman upon each side of him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15061' title='15061'>'It was a joke, my good sir; a practical joke, nothing more,' he whined incessantly. </span>
<span sid='15062' title='15062'>'I assure you, sir, that I simply concealed myself in order to see the effect of my disappearance, and I am sure that you would not be so unjust as to imagine that I would have allowed any harm to befall poor young Mr McFarlane.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15063' title='15063'>'That's for the jury to decide,' said Lestrade. </span>
<span sid='15064' title='15064'>'Anyhow, we shall have you on a charge of conspiracy, if not for attempted murder.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15065' title='15065'>'And you'll probably find that your creditors will impound the banking account of Mr Cornelius,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15066' title='15066'>The little man started and turned his malignant eyes upon my friend.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15067' title='15067'>'I have to thank you for a good deal,' said he. </span>
<span sid='15068' title='15068'>'Perhaps I'll pay my debt some day.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='15069' title='15069'>Holmes smiled indulgently.</span>
<p>
<span sid='15070' title='15070'>'I fancy that for some few years you will find your time very fully occupied,' said he. </span>
<span sid='15071' title='15071'>'By the way, what was it you put into the wood-pile besides your old trousers? </span>
<span sid='15072' title='15072'>A dead dog, or rabbits, or what? </span>
<span sid='15073' title='15073'>You won't tell? </span>
<span sid='15074' title='15074'>Dear me, how very unkind of you! </span>
<span sid='15075' title='15075'>Well, well, I dare say that a couple of rabbits would account both for the blood and for the charred ashes. </span>
<span sid='15076' title='15076'>If ever you write an account, Watson, you can make rabbits serve your turn.'</span>
