<p class="subtitle">Arthur Conan Doyle<label for="sn-meta-devi" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-meta-devi" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><!--googleoff: all--><b>Story Number</b>: 43<br><b>Published in</b>: The Strand Magazine in December 1910<br><b>Collected in</b>: His Last Bow: Some Reminiscences of Sherlock Holmes<!--googleon: all--></span></p>
<p>
<span sid='25447' title='25447'>In recording from time to time some of the curious experiences and interesting recollections which I associate with my long and intimate friendship with Mr Sherlock Holmes, I have continually been faced by difficulties caused by his own aversion to publicity. </span>
<span sid='25448' title='25448'>To his sombre and cynical spirit all popular applause was always abhorrent, and nothing amused him more at the end of a successful case than to hand over the actual exposure to some orthodox official, and to listen with a mocking smile to the general chorus of misplaced congratulation. </span>
<span sid='25449' title='25449'>It was indeed this attitude upon the part of my friend, and certainly not any lack of interesting material, which has caused me of late years to lay very few of my records before the public. </span>
<span sid='25450' title='25450'>My participation in some of his adventures was always a privilege which entailed discretion and reticence upon me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25451' title='25451'>It was, then, with considerable surprise that I received a telegram from Holmes last Tuesday - he has never been known to write where a telegram would serve - in the following terms: 'Why not tell them of the Cornish horror-strangest case I have handled.' </span>
<span sid='25452' title='25452'>I have no idea what backward sweep of memory had brought the matter fresh to his mind, or what freak had caused him to desire that I should recount it, but I hasten, before another cancelling telegram may arrive, to hunt out the notes which give me the exact details of the case, and to lay the narrative before my readers.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25453' title='25453'>It was, then, in the spring of the year 1897 that Holmes's iron constitution showed some symptoms of giving way in the face of constant hard work of a most exacting kind, aggravated, perhaps, by occasional indiscretions of his own. </span>
<span sid='25454' title='25454'>In March of that year Dr Moore Agar, of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Harley Street&t=h'>Harley Street</a>, whose dramatic introduction to Holmes I may some day recount, gave positive injunctions that the famous private agent would lay aside all his cases and surrender himself to complete rest if he wished to avert an absolute breakdown. </span>
<span sid='25455' title='25455'>The state of his health was not a matter in which he himself took the faintest interest, for his mental detachment was absolute, but he was induced at last, on the threat of being permanently disqualified from work, to give himself a complete change of scene and air. </span>
<span sid='25456' title='25456'>Thus it was that in the early spring of that year we found ourselves together in a small cottage near <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Poldhu Bay&t=h'>Poldhu Bay</a>, at the further extremity of the Cornish peninsula.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25457' title='25457'>It was a singular spot, and one peculiarly well suited to the grim humour of my patient. </span>
<span sid='25458' title='25458'>From the windows of our little whitewashed house, which stood high upon a grassy headland, we looked down upon the whole sinister semicircle of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Mounts Bay&t=h'>Mounts Bay</a>, that old death-trap of sailing vessels, with its fringe of black cliffs and surge-swept reefs on which innumerable seamen have met their end. </span>
<span sid='25459' title='25459'>With a northerly breeze it lies placid and sheltered, inviting the storm-tossed craft to tack into it for rest and protection.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25460' title='25460'>Then comes the sudden swirl round of the wind, the blustering gale from the south-west, the dragging anchor, the lee shore, and the last battle in the creaming breakers. </span>
<span sid='25461' title='25461'>The wise mariner stands far out from that evil place.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25462' title='25462'>On the land side our surroundings were as sombre as on the sea. </span>
<span sid='25463' title='25463'>It was a country of rolling moors, lonely and dun-coloured, with an occasional church tower to mark the site of some old-world village. </span>
<span sid='25464' title='25464'>In every direction upon these moors there were traces of some vanished race which had passed utterly away, and left as its sole record strange monuments of stone, irregular mounds which contained the burned ashes of the dead, and curious earth-works which hinted at prehistoric strife. </span>
<span sid='25465' title='25465'>The glamour and mystery of the place, with its sinister atmosphere of forgotten nations, appealed to the imagination of my friend, and he spent much of his time in long walks and solitary meditations upon the moor. </span>
<span sid='25466' title='25466'>The ancient Cornish language had also arrested his attention, and he had, I remember, conceived the idea that it was akin to the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chaldea&t=h'>Chaldea</a>n, and had been largely derived from the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Phoenicia&t=h'>Phoenicia</a>n traders in tin. </span>
<span sid='25467' title='25467'>He had received a consignment of books upon philology and was settling down to develop this thesis, when suddenly, to my sorrow and to his unfeigned delight, we found ourselves, even in that land of dreams, plunged into a problem at our very doors which was more intense, more engrossing, and infinitely more mysterious than any of those which had driven us from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='25468' title='25468'>Our simple life and peaceful, healthy routine were violently interrupted, and we were precipitated into the midst of a series of events which caused the utmost excitement not only in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Cornwall&t=h'>Cornwall</a>, but throughout the whole West of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>. </span>
<span sid='25469' title='25469'>Many of my readers may retain some recollection of what was called at the time 'The Cornish Horror', though a most imperfect account of the matter reached the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> Press. </span>
<span sid='25470' title='25470'>Now, after thirteen years, I will give the true details of this inconceivable affair to the public.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25471' title='25471'>I have said that scattered towers marked the villages which dotted this part of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Cornwall&t=h'>Cornwall</a>. </span>
<span sid='25472' title='25472'>The nearest of these was the hamlet of Tredannick Wollas, where the cottages of a couple of hundred inhabitants clustered round an ancient, moss-grown church. </span>
<span sid='25473' title='25473'>The vicar of the parish, Mr Roundhay, was something of an archaeologist, and as such Holmes had made his acquaintance. </span>
<span sid='25474' title='25474'>He was a middle-aged man, portly and affable, with a considerable fund of local lore. </span>
<span sid='25475' title='25475'>At his invitation we had taken tea at the vicarage, and had come to know, also, Mr Mortimer Tregennis, an independent gentleman, who increased the clergyman's scanty resources by taking rooms in his large, straggling house. </span>
<span sid='25476' title='25476'>The vicar, being a bachelor, was glad to come to such an arrangement, though he had little in common with his lodger, who was a thin, dark, spectacled man, with a stoop which gave the impression of actual, physical deformity. </span>
<span sid='25477' title='25477'>I remember that during our short visit we found the vicar garrulous, but his lodger strangely reticent, a sad-faced, introspective man, sitting with averted eyes, brooding apparently upon his own affairs.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25478' title='25478'>These were the two men who entered abruptly into our little sitting-room on Tuesday, March the 16th, shortly after our breakfast hour, as we were smoking together, preparatory to our daily excursion upon the moors.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25479' title='25479'>'Mr Holmes,' said the vicar, in an agitated voice, 'the most extraordinary and tragic affair has occurred during the night. </span>
<span sid='25480' title='25480'>It is the most unheard-of business. </span>
<span sid='25481' title='25481'>We can only regard it as a special Providence that you should chance to be here at the time, for in all <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> you are the one man we need.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25482' title='25482'>I glared at the intrusive vicar with no very friendly eyes, but Holmes took his pipe from his lips and sat up in his chair like an old hound who hears the view-hallo. </span>
<span sid='25483' title='25483'>He waved his hand to the sofa, and our palpitating visitor with his agitated companion sat side by side upon it. </span>
<span sid='25484' title='25484'>Mr Mortimer Tregennis was more self-contained than the clergyman, but the twitching of his thin hands and the brightness of his dark eyes showed that they shared a common emotion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25485' title='25485'>'Shall I speak or you?' he asked of the vicar.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25486' title='25486'>'Well, as you seem to have made the discovery, whatever it may be, and the vicar to have had it second-hand, perhaps you had better do the speaking,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25487' title='25487'>I glanced at the hastily-clad clergyman, with the formally-dressed lodger seated beside him, and was amused at the surprise which Holmes's simple deduction had brought to their faces.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25488' title='25488'>'Perhaps I had best say a few words first,' said the vicar, 'and then you can judge if you will listen to the details from Mr Tregennis, or whether we should not hasten at once to the scene of this mysterious affair. </span>
<span sid='25489' title='25489'>I may explain, then, that our friend here spent last evening in the company of his two brothers, Owen and George, and of his sister Brenda, at their house of Tredannick Wartha, which is near the old stone cross upon the moor. </span>
<span sid='25490' title='25490'>He left them shortly after ten o'clock, playing cards round the dining-room table, in excellent health and spirits. </span>
<span sid='25491' title='25491'>This morning, being an early riser, he walked in that direction before breakfast, and was overtaken by the carriage of Dr Richards, who explained that he had just been sent for on a most urgent call to Tredannick Wartha. </span>
<span sid='25492' title='25492'>Mr Mortimer Tregennis naturally went with him. </span>
<span sid='25493' title='25493'>When he arrived at Tredannick Wartha he found an extraordinary state of things. </span>
<span sid='25494' title='25494'>His two brothers and his sister were seated round the table exactly as he had left them, the cards still spread in front of them and the candles burned down to their sockets. </span>
<span sid='25495' title='25495'>The sister lay back stone-dead in her chair, while the two brothers sat on each side of her laughing, shouting, and singing, the senses stricken clean out of them. </span>
<span sid='25496' title='25496'>All three of them, the dead woman and the two demented men, retained upon their faces an expression of the utmost horror - a convulsion of terror which was dreadful to look upon. </span>
<span sid='25497' title='25497'>There was no sign of the presence of anyone in the house, except Mrs Porter, the old cook and housekeeper, who declared that she had slept deeply and heard no sound during the night. </span>
<span sid='25498' title='25498'>Nothing had been stolen or disarranged, and there is absolutely no explanation of what the horror can be which has frightened a woman to death and two strong men out of their senses. </span>
<span sid='25499' title='25499'>There is the situation, Mr Holmes, in a nutshell, and if you can help us to clear it up you will have done a great work.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25500' title='25500'>I had hoped that in some way I could coax my companion back into the quiet which had been the object of our journey, but one glance at his intense face and contracted eyebrows told me how vain was now the expectation. </span>
<span sid='25501' title='25501'>He sat for some little time in silence, absorbed in the strange drama which had broken in upon our peace.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25502' title='25502'>'I will look into this matter,' he said at last. </span>
<span sid='25503' title='25503'>'On the face of it, it would appear to be a case of a very exceptional nature. </span>
<span sid='25504' title='25504'>Have you been there yourself, Mr Roundhay?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25505' title='25505'>'No, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='25506' title='25506'>Mr Tregennis brought back the account to the vicarage, and I at once hurried over with him to consult you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25507' title='25507'>'How far is it to the house where this singular tragedy occurred?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25508' title='25508'>'About a mile inland.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25509' title='25509'>'Then we shall walk over together. </span>
<span sid='25510' title='25510'>But, before we start, I must ask you a few questions, Mr Mortimer Tregennis.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25511' title='25511'>The other had been silent all this time, but I had observed that his more controlled excitement was even greater than the obtrusive emotion of the clergyman. </span>
<span sid='25512' title='25512'>He sat with a pale, drawn face, his anxious gaze fixed upon Holmes, and his thin hands clasped convulsively together. </span>
<span sid='25513' title='25513'>His pale lips quivered as he listened to the dreadful experience which had befallen his family, and his dark eyes seemed to reflect something of the horror of the scene.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25514' title='25514'>'Ask what you like, Mr Holmes,' said he, eagerly. </span>
<span sid='25515' title='25515'>'It is a bad thing to speak of, but I will answer you the truth.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25516' title='25516'>'Tell me about last night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25517' title='25517'>'Well, Mr Holmes, I supped there, as the vicar has said, and my elder brother George proposed a game of whist afterwards. </span>
<span sid='25518' title='25518'>We sat down about nine o'clock. </span>
<span sid='25519' title='25519'>It was a quarter past ten when I moved to go. </span>
<span sid='25520' title='25520'>I left them all round the table, as merry as could be.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25521' title='25521'>'Who let you out?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25522' title='25522'>'Mrs Porter had gone to bed, so I let myself out. </span>
<span sid='25523' title='25523'>I shut the hall door behind me. </span>
<span sid='25524' title='25524'>The window of the room in which they sat was closed, but the blind was not drawn down. </span>
<span sid='25525' title='25525'>There was no change in door or window this morning, nor any reason to think that any stranger had been to the house. </span>
<span sid='25526' title='25526'>Yet there they sat, driven clean mad with terror, and Brenda lying dead of fright, with her head hanging over the arm of the chair. </span>
<span sid='25527' title='25527'>I'll never get the sight of that room out of my mind so long as I live.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25528' title='25528'>'The facts, as you state them, are certainly most remarkable,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='25529' title='25529'>'I take it that you have no theory yourself which can in any way account for them?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25530' title='25530'>'It's devilish, Mr Holmes, devilish!' cried Mortimer Tregennis. </span>
<span sid='25531' title='25531'>'It is not of this world. </span>
<span sid='25532' title='25532'>Something has come into that room which has dashed the light of reason from their minds. </span>
<span sid='25533' title='25533'>What human contrivance could do that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25534' title='25534'>'I fear,' said Holmes, 'that if the matter is beyond humanity it is certainly beyond me. </span>
<span sid='25535' title='25535'>Yet we must exhaust all natural explanations before we fall back upon such a theory as this. </span>
<span sid='25536' title='25536'>As to yourself, Mr Tregennis, I take it you were divided in some way from your family, since they lived together and you had rooms apart?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25537' title='25537'>'That is so, Mr Holmes, though the matter is past and done with. </span>
<span sid='25538' title='25538'>We were a family of tin-miners at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Redruth&t=h'>Redruth</a>, but we sold out our venture to a company, and so retired with enough to keep us. </span>
<span sid='25539' title='25539'>I won't deny that there was some feeling about the division of the money and it stood between us for a time, but it was all forgiven and forgotten, and we were the best of friends together.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25540' title='25540'>'Looking back at the evening which you spent together, does anything stand out in your memory as throwing any possible light upon the tragedy? </span>
<span sid='25541' title='25541'>Think carefully, Mr Tregennis, for any clue which can help me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25542' title='25542'>'There is nothing at all, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25543' title='25543'>'Your people were in their usual spirits?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25544' title='25544'>'Never better.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25545' title='25545'>'Were they nervous people? </span>
<span sid='25546' title='25546'>Did they ever show any apprehension of coming danger?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25547' title='25547'>'Nothing of the kind.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25548' title='25548'>'You have nothing to add then, which could assist me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25549' title='25549'>Mortimer Tregennis considered earnestly for a moment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25550' title='25550'>'There is one thing occurs to me,' said he at last. </span>
<span sid='25551' title='25551'>'As we sat at the table my back was to the window, and my brother George, he being my partner at cards, was facing it. </span>
<span sid='25552' title='25552'>I saw him once look hard over my shoulder, so I turned and looked also. </span>
<span sid='25553' title='25553'>The blind was up and the window shut, but I could just make out the bushes on the lawn, and it seemed to me for a moment that I saw something moving among them. </span>
<span sid='25554' title='25554'>I couldn't even say if it were man or animal, but I just thought there was something there. </span>
<span sid='25555' title='25555'>When I asked him what he was looking at, he told me that he had the same feeling. </span>
<span sid='25556' title='25556'>That is all that I can say.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25557' title='25557'>'Did you not investigate?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25558' title='25558'>'No, the matter passed as unimportant.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25559' title='25559'>'You left them, then, without any premonition of evil?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25560' title='25560'>'None at all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25561' title='25561'>'I am not clear how you came to hear the news so early this morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25562' title='25562'>'I am an early riser, and generally take a walk before breakfast. </span>
<span sid='25563' title='25563'>This morning I had hardly started when the doctor in his carriage overtook me. </span>
<span sid='25564' title='25564'>He told me that old Mrs Porter had sent a boy down with an urgent message. </span>
<span sid='25565' title='25565'>I sprang in beside him and we drove on. </span>
<span sid='25566' title='25566'>When we got there we looked into that dreadful room. </span>
<span sid='25567' title='25567'>The candles and the fire must have burned out hours before, and they had been sitting there in the dark until dawn had broken. </span>
<span sid='25568' title='25568'>The doctor said Brenda must have been dead at least six hours. </span>
<span sid='25569' title='25569'>There were no signs of violence. </span>
<span sid='25570' title='25570'>She just lay across the arm of the chair with that look on her face. </span>
<span sid='25571' title='25571'>George and Owen were singing snatches of songs and gibbering like two great apes. </span>
<span sid='25572' title='25572'>Oh, it was awful to see! </span>
<span sid='25573' title='25573'>I couldn't stand it, and the doctor was as white as a sheet. </span>
<span sid='25574' title='25574'>Indeed, he fell into a chair in a sort of faint, and we nearly had him on our hands as well.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25575' title='25575'>'Remarkable - most remarkable!' said Holmes, rising and taking his hat. </span>
<span sid='25576' title='25576'>'I think, perhaps, we had better go down to Tredannick Wartha without further delay. </span>
<span sid='25577' title='25577'>I confess that I have seldom known a case which at first sight presented a more singular problem.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25578' title='25578'>Our proceedings of that first morning did little to advance the investigation. </span>
<span sid='25579' title='25579'>It was marked, however, at the outset by an incident which left the most sinister impression upon my mind. </span>
<span sid='25580' title='25580'>The approach to the spot at which the tragedy occurred is down a narrow, winding, country lane. </span>
<span sid='25581' title='25581'>While we made our way along it we heard the rattle of a carriage coming towards us, and stood aside to let it pass. </span>
<span sid='25582' title='25582'>As it drove by us I caught a glimpse through the closed window of a horribly contorted, grinning face glaring out at us. </span>
<span sid='25583' title='25583'>Those staring eyes and gnashing teeth flashed past us like a dreadful vision.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25584' title='25584'>'My brothers!' cried Mortimer Tregennis, white to the lips. </span>
<span sid='25585' title='25585'>'They are taking them to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Helston&t=h'>Helston</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25586' title='25586'>We looked with horror after the black carriage, lumbering upon its way. </span>
<span sid='25587' title='25587'>Then we turned our steps towards this ill-omened house in which they had met their strange fate.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25588' title='25588'>It was a large and bright dwelling, rather a villa than a cottage, with a considerable garden which was already, in that Cornish air, well filled with spring flowers. </span>
<span sid='25589' title='25589'>Towards this garden the window of the sitting-room fronted, and from it, according to Mortimer Tregennis, must have come that thing of evil which had by sheer horror in a single instant blasted their minds. </span>
<span sid='25590' title='25590'>Holmes walked slowly and thoughtfully among the flower-plots and along the path before we entered the porch. </span>
<span sid='25591' title='25591'>So absorbed was he in his thoughts, I remember, that he stumbled over the watering-pot, upset its contents, and deluged both our feet and the garden path. </span>
<span sid='25592' title='25592'>Inside the house we were met by the elderly Cornish housekeeper, Mrs Porter, who, with the aid of a young girl, looked after the wants of the family. </span>
<span sid='25593' title='25593'>She readily answered all Holmes's questions. </span>
<span sid='25594' title='25594'>She had heard nothing in the night. </span>
<span sid='25595' title='25595'>Her employers had all been in excellent spirits lately, and she had never known them more cheerful and prosperous. </span>
<span sid='25596' title='25596'>She had fainted with horror upon entering the room in the morning and seeing that dreadful company round the table. </span>
<span sid='25597' title='25597'>She had, when she recovered, thrown open the window to let the morning air in, and had run down to the lane, whence she sent a farm-lad for the doctor. </span>
<span sid='25598' title='25598'>The lady was on her bed upstairs, if we cared to see her. </span>
<span sid='25599' title='25599'>It took four strong men to get the brothers into the asylum carriage. </span>
<span sid='25600' title='25600'>She would not herself stay in the house another day, and was starting that very afternoon to rejoin her family at St Ives.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25601' title='25601'>We ascended the stairs and viewed the body. </span>
<span sid='25602' title='25602'>Miss Brenda Tregennis had been a very beautiful girl, though now verging upon middle age. </span>
<span sid='25603' title='25603'>Her dark, clear-cut face was handsome, even in death, but there still lingered upon it something of that convulsion of horror which had been her last human emotion. </span>
<span sid='25604' title='25604'>From her bedroom we descended to the sitting-room where this strange tragedy had actually occurred. </span>
<span sid='25605' title='25605'>The charred ashes of the overnight fire lay in the grate. </span>
<span sid='25606' title='25606'>On the table were the four guttered and burned-out candles, with the cards scattered over its surface. </span>
<span sid='25607' title='25607'>The chairs had been moved back against the walls, but all else was as it had been the night before. </span>
<span sid='25608' title='25608'>Holmes paced with light, swift steps about the room, he sat in the various chairs, drawing them up and reconstructing their positions. </span>
<span sid='25609' title='25609'>He tested how much of the garden was visible, he examined the floor, the ceiling, and the fireplace, but never once did I see that sudden brightening of his eyes and tightening of his lips which would have told me that he saw some gleam of light in this utter darkness.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25610' title='25610'>'Why a fire?' he asked once. </span>
<span sid='25611' title='25611'>'Had they always a fire in this small room on a spring evening?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25612' title='25612'>Mortimer Tregennis explained that the night was cold and damp. </span>
<span sid='25613' title='25613'>For that reason, after his arrival, the fire was lit. </span>
<span sid='25614' title='25614'>'What are you going to do now, Mr Holmes?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25615' title='25615'>My friend smiled and laid his hand upon my arm. </span>
<span sid='25616' title='25616'>'I think, Watson, that I shall resume that course of tobacco-poisoning which you have so often and so justly condemned,' said he. </span>
<span sid='25617' title='25617'>'With your permission, gentlemen, we will now return to our cottage, for I am not aware that any new factor is likely to come to our notice here. </span>
<span sid='25618' title='25618'>I will turn the facts over in my mind, Mr Tregennis, and should anything occur to me I will certainly communicate with you and the vicar. </span>
<span sid='25619' title='25619'>In the meantime I wish you both good morning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25620' title='25620'>It was not until long after we were back in Poldhu Cottage that Holmes broke his complete and absorbed silence. </span>
<span sid='25621' title='25621'>He sat coiled in his armchair, his haggard and ascetic face hardly visible amid the blue swirl of his tobacco smoke, his black brows drawn down, his forehead contracted, his eyes vacant and far away. </span>
<span sid='25622' title='25622'>Finally, he laid down his pipe and sprang to his feet.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25623' title='25623'>'It won't do, Watson!' said he, with a laugh. </span>
<span sid='25624' title='25624'>'Let us walk along the cliffs together and search for flint arrows. </span>
<span sid='25625' title='25625'>We are more likely to find them than clues to this problem. </span>
<span sid='25626' title='25626'>To let the brain work without sufficient material is like racing an engine. </span>
<span sid='25627' title='25627'>It racks itself to pieces. </span>
<span sid='25628' title='25628'>The sea air, sunshine, and patience, Watson - all else will come.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25629' title='25629'>'Now, let us calmly define our position, Watson,' he continued, as we skirted the cliffs together. </span>
<span sid='25630' title='25630'>'Let us get a firm grip of the very little which we do know, so that when fresh facts arise we may be ready to fit them into their places. </span>
<span sid='25631' title='25631'>I take it, in the first place, that neither of us is prepared to admit diabolical intrusions into the affairs of men. </span>
<span sid='25632' title='25632'>Let us begin by ruling that entirely out of our minds. </span>
<span sid='25633' title='25633'>Very good. </span>
<span sid='25634' title='25634'>There remain three persons who have been grievously stricken by some conscious or unconscious human agency.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25635' title='25635'>That is firm ground. </span>
<span sid='25636' title='25636'>Now, when did this occur? </span>
<span sid='25637' title='25637'>Evidently, assuming his narrative to be true, it was immediately after Mr Mortimer Tregennis had left the room. </span>
<span sid='25638' title='25638'>That is a very important point. </span>
<span sid='25639' title='25639'>The presumption is that it was within a few minutes afterwards. </span>
<span sid='25640' title='25640'>The cards still lay upon the table. </span>
<span sid='25641' title='25641'>It was already past their usual hour for bed. </span>
<span sid='25642' title='25642'>Yet they had not changed their position or pushed back their chairs. </span>
<span sid='25643' title='25643'>I repeat, then, that the occurrence was immediately after his departure, and not later than eleven o'clock last night.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25644' title='25644'>'Our next obvious step is to check, so far as we can, the movements of Mortimer Tregennis after he left the room. </span>
<span sid='25645' title='25645'>In this there is no difficulty, and they seem to be above suspicion. </span>
<span sid='25646' title='25646'>Knowing my methods as you do, you were, of course, conscious of the somewhat clumsy water-pot expedient by which I obtained a clearer impress of his foot than might otherwise have been possible. </span>
<span sid='25647' title='25647'>The wet, sandy path took it admirably. </span>
<span sid='25648' title='25648'>Last night was also wet, you will remember, and it was not difficult - having obtained a sample print - to pick out his track among others and to follow his movements. </span>
<span sid='25649' title='25649'>He appears to have walked away swiftly in the direction of the vicarage.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25650' title='25650'>'If, then, Mortimer Tregennis disappeared from the scene, and yet some outside person affected the card-players, how can we reconstruct that person, and how was such an impression of horror conveyed? </span>
<span sid='25651' title='25651'>Mrs Porter may be eliminated. </span>
<span sid='25652' title='25652'>She is evidently harmless. </span>
<span sid='25653' title='25653'>Is there any evidence that someone crept up to the garden window and in some manner produced so terrific an effect that he drove those who saw it out of their senses? </span>
<span sid='25654' title='25654'>The only suggestion in this direction comes from Mortimer Tregennis himself, who says that his brother spoke about some movement in the garden. </span>
<span sid='25655' title='25655'>That is certainly remarkable, as the night was rainy, cloudy, and dark. </span>
<span sid='25656' title='25656'>Anyone who had the design to alarm these people would be compelled to place his very face against the glass before he could be seen. </span>
<span sid='25657' title='25657'>There is a three-foot flower-border outside this window, but no indication of a foot-mark. </span>
<span sid='25658' title='25658'>It is difficult to imagine, then, how an outsider could have made so terrible an impression upon the company, nor have we found any possible motive for so strange and elaborate an attempt. </span>
<span sid='25659' title='25659'>You perceive our difficulties, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25660' title='25660'>'They are only too clear,' I answered, with conviction.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25661' title='25661'>'And yet, with a little more material, we may prove that they are not insurmountable,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='25662' title='25662'>'I fancy that among your extensive archives, Watson, you may find some which were nearly as obscure. </span>
<span sid='25663' title='25663'>Meanwhile, we shall put the case aside until more accurate data are available, and devote the rest of our morning to the pursuit of neolithic man.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25664' title='25664'>I may have commented upon my friend's power of mental detachment, but never have I wondered at it more than upon that spring morning in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Cornwall&t=h'>Cornwall</a> when for two hours he discoursed upon celts, arrowheads, and shards, as lightly as if no sinister mystery was waiting for his solution. </span>
<span sid='25665' title='25665'>It was not until we had returned in the afternoon to our cottage that we found a visitor awaiting us, who soon brought our minds back to the matter in hand. </span>
<span sid='25666' title='25666'>Neither of us needed to be told who that visitor was. </span>
<span sid='25667' title='25667'>The huge body, the craggy and deeply-seamed face with the fierce eyes and hawk-like nose, the grizzled hair which nearly brushed our cottage ceiling, the beard - golden at the fringes and white near the lips, save for the nicotine stain from his perpetual cigar - all these were as well known in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> as in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>, and could only be associated with the tremendous personality of Dr Leon Sterndale, the great lion-hunter and explorer.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25668' title='25668'>We had heard of his presence in the district, and had once or twice caught sight of his tall figure upon the moorland paths. </span>
<span sid='25669' title='25669'>He made no advances to us, however, nor would we have dreamed of doing so to him, as it was well known that it was his love of seclusion which caused him to spend the greater part of the intervals between his journeys in a small bungalow buried in the lonely wood of Beauchamp Arriance. </span>
<span sid='25670' title='25670'>Here, amid his books and his maps, he lived an absolutely lonely life, attending to his own simple wants, and paying little apparent heed to the affairs of his neighbours. </span>
<span sid='25671' title='25671'>It was a surprise to me, therefore, to hear him asking Holmes in an eager voice, whether he had made any advance in his reconstruction of this mysterious episode.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25672' title='25672'>'The county police are utterly at fault,' said he, 'but perhaps your wider experience has suggested some conceivable explanation. </span>
<span sid='25673' title='25673'>My only claim to being taken into your confidence is that during my many residences here I have come to know this family of Tregennis very well - indeed, upon my Cornish mother's side I could call them cousins - and their strange fate has naturally been a great shock to me. </span>
<span sid='25674' title='25674'>I may tell you that I had got as far as <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Plymouth&t=h'>Plymouth</a> upon my way to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>, but the news reached me this morning, and I came straight back again to help in the inquiry.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25675' title='25675'>Holmes raised his eyebrows.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25676' title='25676'>'Did you lose your boat through it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25677' title='25677'>'I will take the next.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25678' title='25678'>'Dear me! that is friendship indeed.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25679' title='25679'>'I tell you they were relatives.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25680' title='25680'>'Quite so - cousins of your mother. </span>
<span sid='25681' title='25681'>Was your baggage aboard the ship?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25682' title='25682'>'Some of it, but the main part at the hotel.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25683' title='25683'>'I see. </span>
<span sid='25684' title='25684'>But surely this event could not have found its way into the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Plymouth&t=h'>Plymouth</a> morning papers?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25685' title='25685'>'No, sir, I had a telegram.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25686' title='25686'>'Might I ask from whom?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25687' title='25687'>A shadow passed over the gaunt face of the explorer.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25688' title='25688'>'You are very inquisitive, Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25689' title='25689'>'It is my business.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25690' title='25690'>With an effort, Dr Sterndale recovered his ruffled composure.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25691' title='25691'>'I have no objection to telling you,' he said. </span>
<span sid='25692' title='25692'>'It was Mr Roundhay, the vicar, who sent me the telegram which recalled me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25693' title='25693'>'Thank you,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='25694' title='25694'>'I may say in answer to your original question, that I have not cleared my mind entirely on the subject of this case, but that I have every hope of reaching some conclusion. </span>
<span sid='25695' title='25695'>It would be premature to say more.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25696' title='25696'>'Perhaps you would not mind telling me if your suspicions point in any particular direction?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25697' title='25697'>'No, I can hardly answer that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25698' title='25698'>'Then I have wasted my time, and need not prolong my visit.' </span>
<span sid='25699' title='25699'>The famous doctor strode out of our cottage in considerable ill-humour, and within five minutes Holmes had followed him. </span>
<span sid='25700' title='25700'>I saw him no more until the evening, when he returned with a slow step and haggard face which assured me that he had made no great progress with his investigation. </span>
<span sid='25701' title='25701'>He glanced at a telegram which awaited him, and threw it into the grate.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25702' title='25702'>'From the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Plymouth&t=h'>Plymouth</a> hotel, Watson,' he said. </span>
<span sid='25703' title='25703'>'I learned the name of it from the vicar, and I wired to make certain that Dr Leon Sterndale's account was true. </span>
<span sid='25704' title='25704'>It appears that he did indeed spend last night there, and that he has actually allowed some of his baggage to go on to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>, while he returned to be present at this investigation. </span>
<span sid='25705' title='25705'>What do you make of that, Watson?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25706' title='25706'>'He is deeply interested.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25707' title='25707'>'Deeply interested - yes. </span>
<span sid='25708' title='25708'>There is a thread here which we have not yet grasped, and which might lead us through the tangle. </span>
<span sid='25709' title='25709'>Cheer up, Watson, for I am very sure that our material has not yet all come to hand. </span>
<span sid='25710' title='25710'>When it does, we may soon leave our difficulties behind us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25711' title='25711'>Little did I think how soon the words of Holmes would be realized, or how strange and sinister would be that new development which opened up an entirely fresh line of investigation. </span>
<span sid='25712' title='25712'>I was shaving at my window in the morning when I heard the rattle of hoofs, and, looking up, saw a dogcart coming at a gallop down the road. </span>
<span sid='25713' title='25713'>It pulled up at our door, and our friend the vicar sprang from it and rushed up our garden path. </span>
<span sid='25714' title='25714'>Holmes was already dressed, and we hastened down to meet him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25715' title='25715'>Our visitor was so excited that he could hardly articulate, but at last in gasps and bursts his tragic story came out of him.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25716' title='25716'>'We are devil-ridden, Mr Holmes! </span>
<span sid='25717' title='25717'>My poor parish is devil-ridden!' he cried. </span>
<span sid='25718' title='25718'>'Satan himself is loose in it! </span>
<span sid='25719' title='25719'>We are given over into his hands!' </span>
<span sid='25720' title='25720'>He danced about in his agitation, a ludicrous object if it were not for his ashy face and startled eyes. </span>
<span sid='25721' title='25721'>Finally he shot out his terrible news.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25722' title='25722'>'Mr Mortimer Tregennis died during the night, and with exactly the same symptoms as the rest of his family.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25723' title='25723'>Holmes sprang to his feet, all energy in an instant.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25724' title='25724'>'Can you fit us both into your dogcart?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25725' title='25725'>'Yes, I can.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25726' title='25726'>'Then, Watson, we will postpone our breakfast. </span>
<span sid='25727' title='25727'>Mr Roundhay, we are entirely at your disposal. </span>
<span sid='25728' title='25728'>Hurry - hurry, before things get disarranged.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25729' title='25729'>The lodger occupied two rooms at the vicarage, which were in an angle by themselves, the one above the other. </span>
<span sid='25730' title='25730'>Below was a large sitting-room, above, his bedroom. </span>
<span sid='25731' title='25731'>They looked out upon a croquet-lawn which came up to the windows. </span>
<span sid='25732' title='25732'>We had arrived before the doctor or the police, so that everything was absolutely undisturbed. </span>
<span sid='25733' title='25733'>Let me describe exactly the scene as we saw it upon that misty March morning. </span>
<span sid='25734' title='25734'>It has left an impression which can never be effaced from my mind.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25735' title='25735'>The atmosphere of the room was of a horrible and depressing stuffiness. </span>
<span sid='25736' title='25736'>The servant who had first entered had thrown up the window, or it would have been even more intolerable. </span>
<span sid='25737' title='25737'>This might partly be due to the fact that a lamp stood flaring and smoking on the centre table. </span>
<span sid='25738' title='25738'>Beside it sat the dead man, leaning back in his chair, his thin beard projecting, his spectacles pushed up on to his forehead, and his lean, dark face turned towards the window and twisted into the same distortion of terror which had marked the features of his dead sister. </span>
<span sid='25739' title='25739'>His limbs were convulsed and his fingers contorted as though he had died in a very paroxysm of fear. </span>
<span sid='25740' title='25740'>He was fully clothed, though there were signs that his dressing had been done in a hurry. </span>
<span sid='25741' title='25741'>We had already learned that his bed had been slept in, and that the tragic end had come to him in the early morning.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25742' title='25742'>One realised the red-hot energy which underlay Holmes's phlegmatic exterior when one saw the sudden change which came over him from the moment that he entered the fatal apartment. </span>
<span sid='25743' title='25743'>In an instant he was tense and alert, his eyes shining, his face set, his limbs quivering with eager activity. </span>
<span sid='25744' title='25744'>He was out on the lawn, in through the window, round the room, and up into the bedroom, for all the world like a dashing foxhound drawing a cover. </span>
<span sid='25745' title='25745'>In the bedroom he made a rapid cast around, and ended by throwing open the window, which appeared to give him some fresh cause for excitement, for he leaned out of it with loud ejaculations of interest and delight. </span>
<span sid='25746' title='25746'>Then he rushed down the stair, out through the open window, threw himself upon his face on the lawn, sprang up and into the room once more, all with the energy of the hunter who is at the very heels of his quarry. </span>
<span sid='25747' title='25747'>The lamp, which was an ordinary standard, he examined with minute care, making certain measurements upon its bowl. </span>
<span sid='25748' title='25748'>He carefully scrutinized with his lens the talc shield which covered the top of the chimney, and scraped off some ashes which adhered to its upper surface, putting some of them into an envelope, which he placed in his pocket-book. </span>
<span sid='25749' title='25749'>Finally, just as the doctor and the official police put in an appearance, he beckoned to the vicar and we all three went out upon the lawn.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25750' title='25750'>'I am glad to say that my investigation has not been entirely barren,' he remarked. </span>
<span sid='25751' title='25751'>'I cannot remain to discuss the matter with the police, but I should be exceedingly obliged, Mr Roundhay, if you would give the inspector my compliments and direct his attention to the bedroom window and to the sitting-room lamp. </span>
<span sid='25752' title='25752'>Each is suggestive, and together they are almost conclusive. </span>
<span sid='25753' title='25753'>If the police would desire further information I shall be happy to see any of them at the cottage. </span>
<span sid='25754' title='25754'>And now, Watson, I think that, perhaps, we shall be better employed elsewhere.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25755' title='25755'>It may be that the police resented the intrusion of an amateur, or that they imagined themselves to be upon some hopeful line of investigation, but it is certain that we heard nothing from them for the next two days. </span>
<span sid='25756' title='25756'>During this time Holmes spent some of his time smoking and dreaming in the cottage, but a greater portion in country walks which he undertook alone, returning after many hours without remark as to where he had been. </span>
<span sid='25757' title='25757'>One experiment served to show me the line of his investigation. </span>
<span sid='25758' title='25758'>He had bought a lamp which was the duplicate of the one which had burned in the room of Mortimer Tregennis on the morning of the tragedy. </span>
<span sid='25759' title='25759'>This he filled with the same oil as that used at the vicarage, and he carefully timed the period which it would take to be exhausted. </span>
<span sid='25760' title='25760'>Another experiment which he made was of a more unpleasant nature, and one which I am not likely ever to forget.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25761' title='25761'>'You will remember, Watson,' he remarked one afternoon, 'that there is a single common point of resemblance in the varying reports which have reached us. </span>
<span sid='25762' title='25762'>This concerns the effect of the atmosphere of the room in each case upon those who had first entered it. </span>
<span sid='25763' title='25763'>You will recollect that Mortimer Tregennis, in describing the episode of his last visit to his brothers' house, remarked that the doctor on entering the room fell into a chair? </span>
<span sid='25764' title='25764'>You had forgotten? </span>
<span sid='25765' title='25765'>Well, I can answer for it that it was so. </span>
<span sid='25766' title='25766'>Now, you will remember also that Mrs Porter, the housekeeper, told us that she herself fainted upon entering the room and had afterwards opened the window. </span>
<span sid='25767' title='25767'>In the second case - that of Mortimer Tregennis himself - you cannot have forgotten the horrible stuffiness of the room when we arrived, though the servant had thrown open the window. </span>
<span sid='25768' title='25768'>That servant, I found upon inquiry, was so ill that she had gone to her bed. </span>
<span sid='25769' title='25769'>You will admit, Watson, that these facts are very suggestive. </span>
<span sid='25770' title='25770'>In each case, there is evidence of a poisonous atmosphere. </span>
<span sid='25771' title='25771'>In each case, also, there is combustion going on in the room - in the one case a fire, in the other a lamp. </span>
<span sid='25772' title='25772'>The fire was needed, but the lamp was lit - as a comparison of the oil consumed will show - long after it was broad daylight. </span>
<span sid='25773' title='25773'>Why? </span>
<span sid='25774' title='25774'>Surely because there is some connection between three things - the burning, the stuffy atmosphere, and, finally, the madness or death of those unfortunate people. </span>
<span sid='25775' title='25775'>That is clear, is it not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25776' title='25776'>'It would appear so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25777' title='25777'>'At least we may accept it as a working hypothesis. </span>
<span sid='25778' title='25778'>We will suppose, then, that something was burned in each case which produced an atmosphere causing strange toxic effects. </span>
<span sid='25779' title='25779'>Very good. </span>
<span sid='25780' title='25780'>In the first instance - that of the Tregennis family - this substance was placed in the fire. </span>
<span sid='25781' title='25781'>Now the window was shut, but the fire would naturally carry fumes to some extent up the chimney. </span>
<span sid='25782' title='25782'>Hence one would expect the effects of the poison to be less than in the second case, where there was less escape for the vapour. </span>
<span sid='25783' title='25783'>The result seems to indicate that it was so, since in the first case only the woman, who had presumably the more sensitive organism, was killed, the others exhibiting that temporary or permanent lunacy which is evidently the first effect of the drug. </span>
<span sid='25784' title='25784'>In the second case the result was complete. </span>
<span sid='25785' title='25785'>The facts, therefore, seem to bear out the theory of a poison which worked by combustion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25786' title='25786'>'With this train of reasoning in my head I naturally looked about in Mortimer Tregennis's room to find some remains of this substance. </span>
<span sid='25787' title='25787'>The obvious place to look was the talc shield or smoke-guard of the lamp. </span>
<span sid='25788' title='25788'>There, sure enough, I perceived a number of flaky ashes, and round the edges a fringe of brownish powder, which had not yet been consumed. </span>
<span sid='25789' title='25789'>Half of this I took, as you saw, and I placed it in an envelope.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25790' title='25790'>'Why half, Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25791' title='25791'>'It is not for me, my dear Watson, to stand in the way of the official police force. </span>
<span sid='25792' title='25792'>I leave them all the evidence which I found. </span>
<span sid='25793' title='25793'>The poison still remained upon the talc, had they the wit to find it. </span>
<span sid='25794' title='25794'>Now, Watson, we will light our lamp, we will, however, take the precaution to open our window to avoid the premature decease of two deserving members of society, and you will seat yourself near that open window in an arm-chair, unless, like a sensible man, you determine to have nothing to do with the affair. </span>
<span sid='25795' title='25795'>Oh, you will see it out, will you? </span>
<span sid='25796' title='25796'>I thought I knew my Watson. </span>
<span sid='25797' title='25797'>This chair I will place opposite yours, so that we may be the same distance from the poison, and face to face. </span>
<span sid='25798' title='25798'>The door we will leave ajar. </span>
<span sid='25799' title='25799'>Each is now in a position to watch the other and to bring the experiment to an end should the symptoms seem alarming. </span>
<span sid='25800' title='25800'>Is that all clear? </span>
<span sid='25801' title='25801'>Well, then, I take our powder-or what remains of it - from the envelope, and I lay it above the burning lamp. </span>
<span sid='25802' title='25802'>So! </span>
<span sid='25803' title='25803'>Now, Watson, let us sit down and await developments.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25804' title='25804'>They were not long in coming. </span>
<span sid='25805' title='25805'>I had hardly settled in my chair before I was conscious of a thick, musky odour, subtle and nauseous. </span>
<span sid='25806' title='25806'>At the very first whiff of it my brain and my imagination were beyond all control. </span>
<span sid='25807' title='25807'>A thick, black cloud swirled before my eyes, and my mind told me that in this cloud, unseen as yet, but about to spring out upon my appalled senses, lurked all that was vaguely horrible, all that was monstrous and inconceivably wicked in the universe. </span>
<span sid='25808' title='25808'>Vague shapes swirled and swam amid the dark cloud-bank, each a menace and a warning of something coming, the advent of some unspeakable dweller upon the threshold, whose very shadow would blast my soul. </span>
<span sid='25809' title='25809'>A freezing horror took possession of me. </span>
<span sid='25810' title='25810'>I felt that my hair was rising, that my eyes were protruding, that my mouth was opened, and my tongue like leather. </span>
<span sid='25811' title='25811'>The turmoil within my brain was such that something must surely snap. </span>
<span sid='25812' title='25812'>I tried to scream, and was vaguely aware of some hoarse croak which was my own voice, but distant and detached from myself. </span>
<span sid='25813' title='25813'>At the same moment, in some effort of escape, I broke through that cloud of despair, and had a glimpse of Holmes's face, white, rigid, and drawn with horror - the very look which I had seen upon the features of the dead. </span>
<span sid='25814' title='25814'>It was that vision which gave me an instant of sanity and of strength. </span>
<span sid='25815' title='25815'>I dashed from my chair, threw my arms round Holmes, and together we lurched through the door, and an instant afterwards had thrown ourselves down upon the grass plot and were lying side by side, conscious only of the glorious sunshine which was bursting its way through the hellish cloud of terror which had girt us in. </span>
<span sid='25816' title='25816'>Slowly it rose from our souls like the mists from a landscape, until peace and reason had returned, and we were sitting upon the grass, wiping our clammy foreheads, and looking with apprehension at each other to mark the last traces of that terrific experience which we had undergone.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25817' title='25817'>'Upon my word, Watson!' said Holmes at last, with an unsteady voice, 'I owe you both my thanks and an apology. </span>
<span sid='25818' title='25818'>It was an unjustifiable experiment even for oneself, and doubly so for a friend. </span>
<span sid='25819' title='25819'>I am really very sorry.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25820' title='25820'>'You know,' I answered, with some emotion, for I had never seen so much of Holmes's heart before, 'that it is my greatest joy and privilege to help you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25821' title='25821'>He relapsed at once into the half-humorous, half-cynical vein which was his habitual attitude to those about him. </span>
<span sid='25822' title='25822'>'It would be superfluous to drive us mad, my dear Watson,' said he. </span>
<span sid='25823' title='25823'>'A candid observer would certainly declare that we were so already before we embarked upon so wild an experiment. </span>
<span sid='25824' title='25824'>I confess that I never imagined that the effect could be so sudden and so severe.' </span>
<span sid='25825' title='25825'>He dashed into the cottage, and, reappearing with the burning lamp held at full arm's length, he threw it among a bank of brambles. </span>
<span sid='25826' title='25826'>'We must give the room a little time to clear. </span>
<span sid='25827' title='25827'>I take it, Watson, that you have no longer a shadow of a doubt as to how these tragedies were produced?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25828' title='25828'>'None whatever.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25829' title='25829'>'But the cause remains as obscure as before. </span>
<span sid='25830' title='25830'>Come into the arbour here, and let us discuss it together. </span>
<span sid='25831' title='25831'>That villainous stuff seems still to linger round my throat. </span>
<span sid='25832' title='25832'>I think we must admit that all the evidence points to this man, Mortimer Tregennis, having been the criminal in the first tragedy, though he was the victim in the second one. </span>
<span sid='25833' title='25833'>We must remember, in the first place, that there is some story of a family quarrel, followed by a reconciliation. </span>
<span sid='25834' title='25834'>How bitter that quarrel may have been, or how hollow the reconciliation, we cannot tell. </span>
<span sid='25835' title='25835'>When I think of Mortimer Tregennis, with the foxy face and the small, shrewd, beady eyes behind the spectacles, he is not a man whom I should judge to be of a particularly forgiving disposition. </span>
<span sid='25836' title='25836'>Well, in the next place, you will remember that this idea of someone moving in the garden, which took our attention for a moment from the real cause of the tragedy, emanated from him. </span>
<span sid='25837' title='25837'>He had a motive in misleading us. </span>
<span sid='25838' title='25838'>Finally, if he did not throw this substance into the fire at the moment of leaving the room, who did do so? </span>
<span sid='25839' title='25839'>The affair happened immediately after his departure. </span>
<span sid='25840' title='25840'>Had anyone else come in, the family would certainly have risen from the table. </span>
<span sid='25841' title='25841'>Besides, in peaceful <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Cornwall&t=h'>Cornwall</a>, visitors do not arrive after ten o'clock at night. </span>
<span sid='25842' title='25842'>We may take it, then, that all the evidence points to Mortimer Tregennis as the culprit.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25843' title='25843'>'Then his own death was suicide!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25844' title='25844'>'Well, Watson, it is on the face of it a not impossible supposition. </span>
<span sid='25845' title='25845'>The man who had the guilt upon his soul of having brought such a fate upon his own family might well be driven by remorse to inflict it upon himself. </span>
<span sid='25846' title='25846'>There are, however, some cogent reasons against it. </span>
<span sid='25847' title='25847'>Fortunately, there is one man in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> who knows all about it, and I have made arrangements by which we shall hear the facts this afternoon from his own lips. </span>
<span sid='25848' title='25848'>Ah! he is a little before his time. </span>
<span sid='25849' title='25849'>Perhaps you would kindly step this way, Dr Leon Sterndale. </span>
<span sid='25850' title='25850'>We have been conducting a chemical experiment indoors which has left our little room hardly fit for the reception of so distinguished a visitor.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25851' title='25851'>I had heard the click of the garden gate, and now the majestic figure of the great <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>n explorer appeared upon the path. </span>
<span sid='25852' title='25852'>He turned in some surprise towards the rustic arbour in which we sat.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25853' title='25853'>'You sent for me, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='25854' title='25854'>I had your note about an hour ago, and I have come, though I really do not know why I should obey your summons.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25855' title='25855'>'Perhaps we can clear the point up before we separate,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='25856' title='25856'>'Meanwhile, I am much obliged to you for your courteous acquiescence. </span>
<span sid='25857' title='25857'>You will excuse this informal reception in the open air, but my friend Watson and I have nearly furnished an additional chapter to what the papers call the Cornish Horror, and we prefer a clear atmosphere for the present. </span>
<span sid='25858' title='25858'>Perhaps, since the matters which we have to discuss will affect you personally in a very intimate fashion, it is as well that we should talk where there can be no eavesdropping.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25859' title='25859'>The explorer took his cigar from his lips and gazed sternly at my companion.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25860' title='25860'>'I am at a loss to know, sir,' he said, 'what you can have to speak about which affects me personally in a very intimate fashion.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25861' title='25861'>'The killing of Mortimer Tregennis,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25862' title='25862'>For a moment I wished that I were armed. </span>
<span sid='25863' title='25863'>Sterndale's fierce face turned to a dusky red, his eyes glared, and the knotted, passionate veins started out in his forehead, while he sprang forward with clenched hands towards my companion. </span>
<span sid='25864' title='25864'>Then he stopped, and with a violent effort he resumed a cold, rigid calmness which was, perhaps, more suggestive of danger than his hot-headed outburst.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25865' title='25865'>'I have lived so long among savages and beyond the law,' said he, 'that I have got into the way of being a law to myself. </span>
<span sid='25866' title='25866'>You would do well, Mr Holmes, not to forget it, for I have no desire to do you an injury.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25867' title='25867'>'Nor have I any desire to do you an injury, Dr Sterndale. </span>
<span sid='25868' title='25868'>Surely the clearest proof of it is that, knowing what I know, I have sent for you and not for the police.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25869' title='25869'>Sterndale sat down with a gasp, overawed for, perhaps, the first time in his adventurous life. </span>
<span sid='25870' title='25870'>There was a calm assurance of power in Holmes's manner which could not be withstood. </span>
<span sid='25871' title='25871'>Our visitor stammered for a moment, his great hands opening and shutting in his agitation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25872' title='25872'>'What do you mean?' he asked, at last. </span>
<span sid='25873' title='25873'>'If this is bluff upon your part, Mr Holmes, you have chosen a bad man for your experiment. </span>
<span sid='25874' title='25874'>Let us have no more beating about the bush. </span>
<span sid='25875' title='25875'>What do you mean?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25876' title='25876'>'I will tell you,' said Holmes, 'and the reason why I tell you is that I hope frankness may beget frankness. </span>
<span sid='25877' title='25877'>What my next step may be will depend entirely upon the nature of your own defence.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25878' title='25878'>'My defence?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25879' title='25879'>'Yes, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25880' title='25880'>'My defence against what?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25881' title='25881'>'Against the charge of killing Mortimer Tregennis.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25882' title='25882'>Sterndale mopped his forehead with his handkerchief. </span>
<span sid='25883' title='25883'>'Upon my word, you are getting on,' said he. </span>
<span sid='25884' title='25884'>'Do all your successes depend upon this prodigious power of bluff?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25885' title='25885'>'The bluff', said Holmes, sternly, 'is upon your side, Dr Leon Sterndale, and not upon mine. </span>
<span sid='25886' title='25886'>As proof I will tell you some of the facts upon which my conclusions are based. </span>
<span sid='25887' title='25887'>Of your return from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Plymouth&t=h'>Plymouth</a>, allowing much of your property to go on to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>, I will say nothing save that it first informed me that you were one of the factors which had to be taken into account in reconstructing this drama-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25888' title='25888'>'I came back-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25889' title='25889'>'I have heard your reasons and regard them as unconvincing and inadequate. </span>
<span sid='25890' title='25890'>We will pass that. </span>
<span sid='25891' title='25891'>You came down here to ask me whom I suspected. </span>
<span sid='25892' title='25892'>I refused to answer you. </span>
<span sid='25893' title='25893'>You then went to the vicarage, waited outside it for some time, and finally returned to your cottage.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25894' title='25894'>'How do you know that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25895' title='25895'>'I followed you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25896' title='25896'>'I saw no one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25897' title='25897'>'That is what you may expect to see when I follow you. </span>
<span sid='25898' title='25898'>You spent a restless night at your cottage, and you formed certain plans, which in the early morning you proceeded to put into execution. </span>
<span sid='25899' title='25899'>Leaving your door just as day was breaking, you filled your pocket with some reddish gravel that was lying heaped beside your gate.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25900' title='25900'>Sterndale gave a violent start and looked at Holmes in amazement.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25901' title='25901'>'You then walked swiftly for the mile which separated you from the vicarage. </span>
<span sid='25902' title='25902'>You were wearing, I may remark, the same pair of ribbed tennis shoes which are at the present moment upon your feet. </span>
<span sid='25903' title='25903'>At the vicarage you passed through the orchard and the side hedge, coming out under the window of the lodger Tregennis. </span>
<span sid='25904' title='25904'>It was now daylight, but the household was not yet stirring. </span>
<span sid='25905' title='25905'>You drew some of the gravel from your pocket, and you threw it up at the window above you-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25906' title='25906'>Sterndale sprang to his feet.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25907' title='25907'>'I believe that you are the devil himself!' he cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25908' title='25908'>Holmes smiled at the compliment. </span>
<span sid='25909' title='25909'>'It took two, or possibly three, handfuls before the lodger came to the window. </span>
<span sid='25910' title='25910'>You beckoned him to come down. </span>
<span sid='25911' title='25911'>He dressed hurriedly and descended to his sitting-room. </span>
<span sid='25912' title='25912'>You entered by the window. </span>
<span sid='25913' title='25913'>There was an interview - a short one - during which you walked up and down the room. </span>
<span sid='25914' title='25914'>Then you passed out and closed the window, standing on the lawn outside smoking a cigar and watching what occurred. </span>
<span sid='25915' title='25915'>Finally, after the death of Tregennis, you withdrew as you had come. </span>
<span sid='25916' title='25916'>Now, Dr Sterndale, how do you justify such conduct, and what were the motives for your actions? </span>
<span sid='25917' title='25917'>If you prevaricate or trifle with me, I give you my assurance that the matter will pass out of my hands for ever.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25918' title='25918'>Our visitor's face had turned ashen grey as he listened to the words of his accuser. </span>
<span sid='25919' title='25919'>Now he sat for some time in thought with his face sunk in his hands. </span>
<span sid='25920' title='25920'>Then, with a sudden impulsive gesture, he plucked a photograph from his breast-pocket and threw it on the rustic table before us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25921' title='25921'>'That is why I have done it,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25922' title='25922'>It showed the bust and face of a very beautiful woman. </span>
<span sid='25923' title='25923'>Holmes stooped over it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25924' title='25924'>'Brenda Tregennis,' said he. </span>
<span sid='25925' title='25925'>'Yes, Brenda Tregennis,' repeated our visitor. </span>
<span sid='25926' title='25926'>'For years I have loved her. </span>
<span sid='25927' title='25927'>For years she has loved me. </span>
<span sid='25928' title='25928'>There is the secret of that Cornish seclusion which people have marvelled at. </span>
<span sid='25929' title='25929'>It has brought me close to the one thing on earth that was dear to me. </span>
<span sid='25930' title='25930'>I could not marry her, for I have a wife who has left me for years and yet whom, by the deplorable laws of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, I could not divorce. </span>
<span sid='25931' title='25931'>For years Brenda waited. </span>
<span sid='25932' title='25932'>For years I waited. </span>
<span sid='25933' title='25933'>And this is what we have waited for.' </span>
<span sid='25934' title='25934'>A terrible sob shook his great frame, and he clutched his throat under his brindled beard. </span>
<span sid='25935' title='25935'>Then with an effort he mastered himself and spoke on.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25936' title='25936'>'The vicar knew. </span>
<span sid='25937' title='25937'>He was in our confidence. </span>
<span sid='25938' title='25938'>He would tell you that she was an angel upon earth. </span>
<span sid='25939' title='25939'>That was why he telegraphed to me and I returned. </span>
<span sid='25940' title='25940'>What was my baggage or <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a> to me when I learned that such a fate had come upon my darling? </span>
<span sid='25941' title='25941'>There you have the missing clue to my action, Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25942' title='25942'>'Proceed,' said my friend.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25943' title='25943'>Dr Sterndale drew from his pocket a paper packet and laid it upon the table. </span>
<span sid='25944' title='25944'>On the outside was written, 'Radix pedis diaboli' with a red poison label beneath it. </span>
<span sid='25945' title='25945'>He pushed it towards me. </span>
<span sid='25946' title='25946'>'I understand that you are a doctor, sir. </span>
<span sid='25947' title='25947'>Have you ever heard of this preparation?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25948' title='25948'>'Devil's-foot root! </span>
<span sid='25949' title='25949'>No, I have never heard of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='25950' title='25950'>'It is no reflection upon your professional knowledge,' said he, 'for I believe that, save for one sample in a laboratory at Buda, there is no other specimen in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>. </span>
<span sid='25951' title='25951'>It has not yet found its way either into the pharmacopoeia or into the literature of toxicology. </span>
<span sid='25952' title='25952'>The root is shaped like a foot, half human, half goat-like, hence the fanciful name given by a botanical missionary. </span>
<span sid='25953' title='25953'>It is used as an ordeal poison by the medicine-men in certain districts of West <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>, and is kept as a secret among them. </span>
<span sid='25954' title='25954'>This particular specimen I obtained under very extraordinary circumstances in the Ubanghi country.' </span>
<span sid='25955' title='25955'>He opened the paper as he spoke, and disclosed a heap of reddish-brown, snuff-like powder.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25956' title='25956'>'Well, sir?' asked Holmes, sternly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25957' title='25957'>'I am about to tell you, Mr Holmes, all that actually occurred, for you already know so much that it is clearly to my interest that you should know all. </span>
<span sid='25958' title='25958'>I have already explained the relationship in which I stood to the Tregennis family. </span>
<span sid='25959' title='25959'>For the sake of the sister I was friendly with the brothers. </span>
<span sid='25960' title='25960'>There was a family quarrel about money which estranged this man Mortimer, but it was supposed to be made up, and I afterwards met him as I did the others. </span>
<span sid='25961' title='25961'>He was a sly, subtle, scheming man, and several things arose which gave me a suspicion of him, but I had no cause for any positive quarrel.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25962' title='25962'>'One day, only a couple of weeks ago, he came down to my cottage and I showed him some of my <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>n curiosities. </span>
<span sid='25963' title='25963'>Among other things I exhibited this powder, and I told him of its strange properties, how it stimulates those brain centres which control the emotion of fear, and how either madness or death is the fate of the unhappy native who is subjected to the ordeal by the priest of his tribe. </span>
<span sid='25964' title='25964'>I told him also how powerless <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>an science would be to detect it. </span>
<span sid='25965' title='25965'>How he took it I cannot say, for I never left the room, but there is no doubt that it was then, while I was opening cabinets and stooping to boxes, that he managed to abstract some of the devil's-foot root. </span>
<span sid='25966' title='25966'>I well remember how he plied me with questions as to the amount and the time that was needed for its effect, but I little dreamed that he could have a personal reason for asking.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25967' title='25967'>'I thought no more of the matter until the vicar's telegram reached me at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Plymouth&t=h'>Plymouth</a>. </span>
<span sid='25968' title='25968'>This villain had thought that I would be at sea before the news could reach me, and that I should be lost for years in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>. </span>
<span sid='25969' title='25969'>But I returned at once. </span>
<span sid='25970' title='25970'>Of course, I could not listen to the details without feeling assured that my poison had been used. </span>
<span sid='25971' title='25971'>I came round to see you on the chance that some other explanation had suggested itself to you. </span>
<span sid='25972' title='25972'>But there could be none. </span>
<span sid='25973' title='25973'>I was convinced that Mortimer Tregennis was the murderer, that for the sake of money, and with the idea, perhaps, that if the other members of his family were all insane he would be the sole guardian of their joint property, he had used the devil's foot powder upon them, driven two of them out of their senses, and killed his sister Brenda, the one human being whom I have ever loved or who has ever loved me. </span>
<span sid='25974' title='25974'>There was his crime, what was to be his punishment?</span>
<p>
<span sid='25975' title='25975'>'Should I appeal to the law? </span>
<span sid='25976' title='25976'>Where were my proofs? </span>
<span sid='25977' title='25977'>I knew that the facts were true, but could I hope to make a jury of countrymen believe so fantastic a story? </span>
<span sid='25978' title='25978'>I might or I might not. </span>
<span sid='25979' title='25979'>But I could not afford to fail. </span>
<span sid='25980' title='25980'>My soul cried out for revenge. </span>
<span sid='25981' title='25981'>I have said to you once before, Mr Holmes, that I have spent much of my life outside the law, and that I have come at last to be a law to myself. </span>
<span sid='25982' title='25982'>So it was now. </span>
<span sid='25983' title='25983'>I determined that the fate which he had given to others should be shared by himself. </span>
<span sid='25984' title='25984'>Either that, or I would do justice upon him with my own hand. </span>
<span sid='25985' title='25985'>In all <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> there can be no man who sets less value upon his own life than I do at the present moment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='25986' title='25986'>'Now I have told you all. </span>
<span sid='25987' title='25987'>You have yourself supplied the rest. </span>
<span sid='25988' title='25988'>I did, as you say, after a restless night, set off early from my cottage. </span>
<span sid='25989' title='25989'>I foresaw the difficulty of arousing him, so I gathered some gravel from the pile which you have mentioned, and I used it to throw up to his window. </span>
<span sid='25990' title='25990'>He came down and admitted me through the window of the sitting-room. </span>
<span sid='25991' title='25991'>I laid his offence before him. </span>
<span sid='25992' title='25992'>I told him that I had come both as judge and executioner. </span>
<span sid='25993' title='25993'>The wretch sank into a chair paralysed at the sight of my revolver. </span>
<span sid='25994' title='25994'>I lit the lamp, put the powder above it, and stood outside the window, ready to carry out my threat to shoot him should he try to leave the room. </span>
<span sid='25995' title='25995'>In five minutes he died. </span>
<span sid='25996' title='25996'>My God! how he died! </span>
<span sid='25997' title='25997'>But my heart was flint, for he endured nothing which my innocent darling had not felt before him. </span>
<span sid='25998' title='25998'>There is my story, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='25999' title='25999'>Perhaps, if you loved a woman, you would have done as much yourself. </span>
<span sid='26000' title='26000'>At any rate, I am in your hands. </span>
<span sid='26001' title='26001'>You can take what steps you like. </span>
<span sid='26002' title='26002'>As I have already said, there is no man living who can fear death less than I do.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26003' title='26003'>Holmes sat for some little time in silence. </span>
<span sid='26004' title='26004'>'What were your plans?' he asked, at last. </span>
<span sid='26005' title='26005'>'I had intended to bury myself in Central <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>. </span>
<span sid='26006' title='26006'>My work there is but half finished.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26007' title='26007'>'Go and do the other half,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='26008' title='26008'>'I, at least, am not prepared to prevent you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26009' title='26009'>Dr Sterndale raised his giant figure, bowed gravely, and walked from the arbour. </span>
<span sid='26010' title='26010'>Holmes lit his pipe and handed me his pouch.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26011' title='26011'>'Some fumes which are not poisonous would be a welcome change,' said he. </span>
<span sid='26012' title='26012'>'I think you must agree, Watson, that it is not a case in which we are called upon to interfere. </span>
<span sid='26013' title='26013'>Our investigation has been independent, and our action shall be so also. </span>
<span sid='26014' title='26014'>You would not denounce the man?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26015' title='26015'>'Certainly not,' I answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26016' title='26016'>'I have never loved, Watson, for if I did and if the woman I loved had met such an end, I might act even as our lawless lion-hunter has done. </span>
<span sid='26017' title='26017'>Who knows? </span>
<span sid='26018' title='26018'>Well, Watson, I will not offend your intelligence by explaining what is obvious. </span>
<span sid='26019' title='26019'>The gravel upon the window-sill was, of course, the starting-point of my research. </span>
<span sid='26020' title='26020'>It was unlike anything in the vicarage garden. </span>
<span sid='26021' title='26021'>Only when my attention had been drawn to Dr Sterndale and his cottage did I find its counterpart. </span>
<span sid='26022' title='26022'>The lamp shining in broad daylight and the remains of powder upon the shield were successive links in a fairly obvious chain. </span>
<span sid='26023' title='26023'>And now, my dear Watson, I think we may dismiss the matter from our mind, and go back with a clear conscience to the study of those <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chaldea&t=h'>Chaldea</a>n roots which are surely to be traced in the Cornish branch of the great Celtic speech.'</span>
