<h1><span sid='56836' title='56836'>The Adventure of the Three Garridebs</span></h1>
<p class="subtitle">Arthur Conan Doyle<label for="sn-meta-3gar" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-meta-3gar" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><!--googleoff: all--><b>Story Number</b>: 53<br><b>Published in</b>: The Collier's magazine, 25 October 1924 (US)<br><b>Collected in</b>: The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes<!--googleon: all--></span></p>
<p>
<span sid='56837' title='56837'>It may have been a comedy, or it may have been a tragedy. </span>
<span sid='56838' title='56838'>It cost one man his reason, it cost me a bloodletting, and it cost yet another man the penalties of the law. </span>
<span sid='56839' title='56839'>Yet there was certainly an element of comedy. </span>
<span sid='56840' title='56840'>Well, you shall judge for yourselves.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56841' title='56841'>I remember the date very well, for it was in the same month that Holmes refused a knighthood for services which may perhaps some day be described. </span>
<span sid='56842' title='56842'>I only refer to the matter in passing, for in my position of partner and confidant I am obliged to be particularly careful to avoid any indiscretion. </span>
<span sid='56843' title='56843'>I repeat, however, that this enables me to fix the date, which was the latter end of June, 1902, shortly after the conclusion of the South <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>n War. </span>
<span sid='56844' title='56844'>Holmes had spent several days in bed, as was his habit from time to time, but he emerged that morning with a long foolscap document in his hand and a twinkle of amusement in his austere grey eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56845' title='56845'>'There is a chance for you to make some money, friend Watson,' said he. </span>
<span sid='56846' title='56846'>'Have you ever heard the name of Garrideb?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56847' title='56847'>I admitted that I had not.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56848' title='56848'>'Well, if you can lay your hands upon a Garrideb, there's money in it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56849' title='56849'>'Why?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56850' title='56850'>'Ah, that's a long story - rather a whimsical one, too. </span>
<span sid='56851' title='56851'>I don't think in all our explorations of human complexities we have ever come upon anything more singular. </span>
<span sid='56852' title='56852'>The fellow will be here presently for cross-examination, so I won't open the matter up till he comes. </span>
<span sid='56853' title='56853'>But meanwhile, that's the name we want.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56854' title='56854'>The telephone directory lay on the table beside me, and I turned over the pages in a rather hopeless quest. </span>
<span sid='56855' title='56855'>But to my amazement there was this strange name in its due place. </span>
<span sid='56856' title='56856'>I gave a cry of triumph.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56857' title='56857'>'Here you are, Holmes! </span>
<span sid='56858' title='56858'>Here it is!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56859' title='56859'>Holmes took the book from my hand.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56860' title='56860'>'"Garrideb, N.,'" he read, '"136 Little Ryder Street, W." </span>
<span sid='56861' title='56861'>Sorry to disappoint you, my dear Watson, but this is the man himself. </span>
<span sid='56862' title='56862'>That is the address upon his letter. </span>
<span sid='56863' title='56863'>We want another to match him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56864' title='56864'>Mrs Hudson had come in with a card upon a tray. </span>
<span sid='56865' title='56865'>I took it up and glanced at it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56866' title='56866'>'Why, here it is!' I cried in amazement. </span>
<span sid='56867' title='56867'>'This is a different initial. </span>
<span sid='56868' title='56868'>John Garrideb, Counsellor at Law, Moorville, Kansas, USA.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56869' title='56869'>Holmes smiled as he looked at the card. </span>
<span sid='56870' title='56870'>'I am afraid you must make yet another effort, Watson,' said he. </span>
<span sid='56871' title='56871'>'This gentleman is also in the plot already, though I certainly did not expect to see him this morning. </span>
<span sid='56872' title='56872'>However, he is in a position to tell us a good deal which I want to know.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56873' title='56873'>A moment later he was in the room. </span>
<span sid='56874' title='56874'>Mr John Garrideb, Counsellor at Law, was a short, powerful man with the round, fresh, clean-shaven face characteristic of so many <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n men of affairs. </span>
<span sid='56875' title='56875'>The general effect was chubby and rather childlike, so that one received the impression of quite a young man with a broad set smile upon his face. </span>
<span sid='56876' title='56876'>His eyes, however, were arresting. </span>
<span sid='56877' title='56877'>Seldom in any human head have I seen a pair which bespoke a more intense inward life, so bright were they, so alert, so responsive to every change of thought. </span>
<span sid='56878' title='56878'>His accent was <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n, but was not accompanied by any eccentricity of speech.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56879' title='56879'>'Mr Holmes?' he asked, glancing from one to the other. </span>
<span sid='56880' title='56880'>'Ah, yes! </span>
<span sid='56881' title='56881'>Your pictures are not unlike you, sir, if I may say so. </span>
<span sid='56882' title='56882'>I believe you have had a letter from my namesake, Mr Nathan Garrideb, have you not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56883' title='56883'>'Pray sit down,' said Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='56884' title='56884'>'We shall, I fancy, have a good deal to discuss.' </span>
<span sid='56885' title='56885'>He took up his sheets of foolscap. </span>
<span sid='56886' title='56886'>'You are, of course, the Mr John Garrideb mentioned in this document. </span>
<span sid='56887' title='56887'>But surely you have been in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a> some time?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56888' title='56888'>'Why do you say that, Mr Holmes?' </span>
<span sid='56889' title='56889'>I seemed to read sudden suspicion in those expressive eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56890' title='56890'>'Your whole outfit is English.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56891' title='56891'>Mr Garrideb forced a laugh. </span>
<span sid='56892' title='56892'>'I've read of your tricks, Mr Holmes, but I never thought I would be the subject of them. </span>
<span sid='56893' title='56893'>Where do you read that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56894' title='56894'>'The shoulder cut of your coat, the toes of your boots-could anyone doubt it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56895' title='56895'>'Well, well, I had no idea I was so obvious a Britisher. </span>
<span sid='56896' title='56896'>But business brought me over here some time ago, and so, as you say, my outfit is nearly all <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='56897' title='56897'>However, I guess your time is of value, and we did not meet to talk about the cut of my socks. </span>
<span sid='56898' title='56898'>What about getting down to that paper you hold in your hand?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56899' title='56899'>Holmes had in some way ruffled our visitor, whose chubby face had assumed a far less amiable expression.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56900' title='56900'>'Patience! </span>
<span sid='56901' title='56901'>Patience, Mr Garrideb!' said my friend in a soothing voice. </span>
<span sid='56902' title='56902'>'Dr Watson would tell you that these little digressions of mine sometimes prove in the end to have some bearing on the matter. </span>
<span sid='56903' title='56903'>But why did Mr Nathan Garrideb not come with you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56904' title='56904'>'Why did he ever drag you into it at all?' asked our visitor, with a sudden outflame of anger. </span>
<span sid='56905' title='56905'>'What in thunder had you to do with it? </span>
<span sid='56906' title='56906'>Here was a bit of professional business between two gentlemen, and one of them must needs call in a detective! </span>
<span sid='56907' title='56907'>I saw him this morning, and he told me this fool trick he had played me, and that's why I am here. </span>
<span sid='56908' title='56908'>But I feel bad about it, all the same.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56909' title='56909'>'There was no reflection upon you, Mr Garrideb. </span>
<span sid='56910' title='56910'>It was simply zeal upon his part to gain your end - an end which is, I understand, equally vital for both of you. </span>
<span sid='56911' title='56911'>He knew that I had means of getting information, and, therefore, it was very natural that he should apply to me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56912' title='56912'>Our visitor's angry face gradually cleared.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56913' title='56913'>'Well, that puts it different,' said he. </span>
<span sid='56914' title='56914'>'When I went to see him this morning and he told me he had sent to a detective, I just asked for your address and came right away. </span>
<span sid='56915' title='56915'>I don't want police butting into a private matter. </span>
<span sid='56916' title='56916'>But if you are content just to help us find the man, there can be no harm in that.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56917' title='56917'>'Well, that is just how it stands,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='56918' title='56918'>'And now, sir, since you are here, we had best have a clear account from your own lips. </span>
<span sid='56919' title='56919'>My friend here knows nothing of the details.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56920' title='56920'>Mr Garrideb surveyed me with not too friendly a gaze.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56921' title='56921'>'Need he know?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56922' title='56922'>'We usually work together.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56923' title='56923'>'Well, there's no reason it should be kept a secret. </span>
<span sid='56924' title='56924'>I'll give you the facts as short as I can make them. </span>
<span sid='56925' title='56925'>If you came from Kansas I would not need to explain to you who Alexander Hamilton Garrideb was. </span>
<span sid='56926' title='56926'>He made his money in real estate, and afterwards in the wheat pit at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>, but he spent it in buying up as much land as would make one of your counties, lying along the Arkansas River, west of Fort Dodge. </span>
<span sid='56927' title='56927'>It's grazing-land and lumber-land and arable land and mineralized land, and just every sort of land that brings dollars to the man that owns it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56928' title='56928'>'He had no kith nor kin - or, if he had, I never heard of it. </span>
<span sid='56929' title='56929'>But he took a kind of pride in the queerness of his name. </span>
<span sid='56930' title='56930'>That was what brought us together. </span>
<span sid='56931' title='56931'>I was in the law at Topeka, and one day I had a visit from the old man, and he was tickled to death to meet another man with his own name. </span>
<span sid='56932' title='56932'>It was his pet fad, and he was dead set to find out if there were any more Garridebs in the world. </span>
<span sid='56933' title='56933'>"Find me another!" said he. </span>
<span sid='56934' title='56934'>I told him I was a busy man and could not spend my life hiking round the world in search of Garridebs. </span>
<span sid='56935' title='56935'>"None the less," said he, "that is just what you will do if things pan out as I planned them." </span>
<span sid='56936' title='56936'>I thought he was joking, but there was a powerful lot of meaning in the words, as I was soon to discover.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56937' title='56937'>'For he died within a year of saying them, and he left a will behind him. </span>
<span sid='56938' title='56938'>It was the queerest will that has ever been filed in the State of Kansas. </span>
<span sid='56939' title='56939'>His property was divided into three parts, and I was to have one in condition that I found two Garridebs who would share the remainder. </span>
<span sid='56940' title='56940'>It's five million dollars for each if it is a cent, but we can't lay a finger on it until we all three stand in a row.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56941' title='56941'>'It was so big a chance that I just let my legal practice slide and I set forth looking for Garridebs. </span>
<span sid='56942' title='56942'>There is not one in the United States. </span>
<span sid='56943' title='56943'>I went through it, sir, with a finetoothed comb and never a Garrideb could I catch. </span>
<span sid='56944' title='56944'>Then I tried the old country. </span>
<span sid='56945' title='56945'>Sure enough there was the name in the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> Telephone Directory. </span>
<span sid='56946' title='56946'>I went after him two days ago and explained the whole matter to him. </span>
<span sid='56947' title='56947'>But he is a lone man, like myself, with some women relations, but no men. </span>
<span sid='56948' title='56948'>It says three adult men in the will. </span>
<span sid='56949' title='56949'>So you see we still have a vacancy, and if you can help to fill it we will be very ready to pay your charges.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56950' title='56950'>'Well, Watson,' said Holmes, with a smile, 'I said it was rather whimsical, did I not? </span>
<span sid='56951' title='56951'>I should have thought, sir, that your obvious way was to advertise in the agony columns of the papers.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56952' title='56952'>'I have done that, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='56953' title='56953'>No replies.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56954' title='56954'>'Dear me! </span>
<span sid='56955' title='56955'>Well, it is certainly a most curious little problem. </span>
<span sid='56956' title='56956'>I may take a glance at it in my leisure. </span>
<span sid='56957' title='56957'>By the way, it is curious that you should have come from Topeka. </span>
<span sid='56958' title='56958'>I used to have a correspondent - he is dead now - old Dr Lysander Starr, who was Mayor in 1890.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56959' title='56959'>'Good old Dr Starr!' said our visitor. </span>
<span sid='56960' title='56960'>'His name is still honoured. </span>
<span sid='56961' title='56961'>Well, Mr Holmes, I suppose all we can do is to report to you and let you know how we progress. </span>
<span sid='56962' title='56962'>I reckon you will hear within a day or two.' </span>
<span sid='56963' title='56963'>With this assurance our <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n bowed and departed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56964' title='56964'>Holmes had lit his pipe, and he sat for some time with a curious smile upon his face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56965' title='56965'>'Well?' I asked at last.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56966' title='56966'>'I am wondering, Watson - just wondering!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56967' title='56967'>'At what?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56968' title='56968'>Holmes took his pipe from his lips.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56969' title='56969'>'I am wondering, Watson, what on earth could be the object of this man in telling us such a rigmarole of lies. </span>
<span sid='56970' title='56970'>I nearly asked him so - for there are times when a brutal frontal attack is the best policy - but I judged it better to let him think he had fooled us. </span>
<span sid='56971' title='56971'>Here is a man with an English coat frayed at the elbow and trousers bagged at the knee with a year's wear, and yet by this document and by his own account he is a provincial <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n lately landed in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='56972' title='56972'>There have been no advertisements in the agony columns. </span>
<span sid='56973' title='56973'>You know that I miss nothing there. </span>
<span sid='56974' title='56974'>They are my favourite covert for putting up a bird, and I would never have overlooked such a cock pheasant as that. </span>
<span sid='56975' title='56975'>I never knew a Dr Lysander Starr of Topeka. </span>
<span sid='56976' title='56976'>Touch him where you would he was false. </span>
<span sid='56977' title='56977'>I think the fellow is really an <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n, but he has worn his accent smooth with years of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='56978' title='56978'>What is his game, then, and what motive lies behind this preposterous search for Garridebs? </span>
<span sid='56979' title='56979'>It's worth our attention, for, granting that the man is a rascal, he is certainly a complex and ingenious one. </span>
<span sid='56980' title='56980'>We must now find out if our other correspondent is a fraud also. </span>
<span sid='56981' title='56981'>Just ring him up, Watson.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56982' title='56982'>I did so, and heard a thin, quavering voice at the other end of the line.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56983' title='56983'>'Yes, yes, I am Mr Nathan Garrideb. </span>
<span sid='56984' title='56984'>Is Mr Holmes there? </span>
<span sid='56985' title='56985'>I should very much like to have a word with Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='56986' title='56986'>My friend took the instrument and I heard the usual syncopated dialogue.</span>
<p>
<span sid='56987' title='56987'>'Yes, he has been here. </span>
<span sid='56988' title='56988'>I understand that you don't know him... </span>
<span sid='56989' title='56989'>How lone?... </span>
<span sid='56990' title='56990'>Only two days!... </span>
<span sid='56991' title='56991'>Yes, yes, of course, it is a most captivating prospect. </span>
<span sid='56992' title='56992'>Will you be at home this evening? </span>
<span sid='56993' title='56993'>I suppose your namesake will not be there?... </span>
<span sid='56994' title='56994'>Very good, we will come then, for I would rather have a chat without him... </span>
<span sid='56995' title='56995'>Dr Watson will come with me... </span>
<span sid='56996' title='56996'>I understood from your note that you did not go out often... </span>
<span sid='56997' title='56997'>Well, we shall be round about six. </span>
<span sid='56998' title='56998'>You need not mention it to the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n lawyer... </span>
<span sid='56999' title='56999'>Very good. </span>
<span sid='57000' title='57000'>Goodbye!'</span>
<span sid='57001' title='57001'>It was twilight of a lovely spring evening, and even Little Ryder Street, one of the smaller offshoots from the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Edgware Road&t=h'>Edgware Road</a>, within a stone-cast of old Tyburn Tree of evil memory, looked golden and wonderful in the slanting rays of the setting sun. </span>
<span sid='57002' title='57002'>The particular house to which we were directed was a large, old-fashioned, Early <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Georgia&t=h'>Georgia</a>n edifice with a flat brick face broken only by two deep bay windows on the ground floor. </span>
<span sid='57003' title='57003'>It was on this ground floor that our client lived, and, indeed, the low windows proved to be the front of the huge room in which he spent his waking hours. </span>
<span sid='57004' title='57004'>Holmes pointed as we passed to the small brass plate which bore the curious name.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57005' title='57005'>'Up some years, Watson,' he remarked, indicating its discoloured surface. </span>
<span sid='57006' title='57006'>'It's his real name, anyhow, and that is something to note.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57007' title='57007'>The house had a common stair, and there were a number of names painted in the hall, some indicating offices and some private chambers. </span>
<span sid='57008' title='57008'>It was not a collection of residential flats, but rather the abode of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bohemia&t=h'>Bohemia</a>n bachelors. </span>
<span sid='57009' title='57009'>Our client opened the door for us himself and apologized by saying that the woman in charge left at four o'clock. </span>
<span sid='57010' title='57010'>Mr Nathan Garrideb proved to be a very tall loose-jointed, round-backed person, gaunt and bald, some sixty-odd years of age. </span>
<span sid='57011' title='57011'>He had a cadaverous face, with the dull dead skin of a man to whom exercise was unknown. </span>
<span sid='57012' title='57012'>Large round spectacles and a small projecting goat's beard combined with his stooping attitude to give him an expression of peering curiosity. </span>
<span sid='57013' title='57013'>The general effect, however, was amiable, though eccentric.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57014' title='57014'>The room was as curious as its occupant. </span>
<span sid='57015' title='57015'>It looked like a small museum. </span>
<span sid='57016' title='57016'>It was both broad and deep, with cupboards and cabinets all round, crowded with specimens, geological and anatomical. </span>
<span sid='57017' title='57017'>Cases of butterflies and moths flanked each side of the entrance. </span>
<span sid='57018' title='57018'>A large table in the centre was littered with all sorts of debris, while the tall brass tube of a powerful microscope bristled up amongst them. </span>
<span sid='57019' title='57019'>As I glanced round I was surprised at the universality of the man's interests. </span>
<span sid='57020' title='57020'>Here was a case of ancient coins. </span>
<span sid='57021' title='57021'>There was a cabinet of flint instruments. </span>
<span sid='57022' title='57022'>Behind his central table was a large cupboard of fossil bones. </span>
<span sid='57023' title='57023'>Above was a line of plaster skulls with such names as 'Neanderthal', 'Heidelberg', 'Cromagnon' printed beneath them. </span>
<span sid='57024' title='57024'>It was clear that he was a student of many subjects. </span>
<span sid='57025' title='57025'>As he stood in front of us now, he held a piece of chamois leather in his right hand with which he was polishing a coin.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57026' title='57026'>'Syracusan - of the best period,' he explained, holding it up. </span>
<span sid='57027' title='57027'>'They degenerated greatly towards the end. </span>
<span sid='57028' title='57028'>At their best I hold them supreme, though some prefer the Alexandrian school. </span>
<span sid='57029' title='57029'>You will find a chair here, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='57030' title='57030'>Pray allow me to clear these bones. </span>
<span sid='57031' title='57031'>And you, sir - ah, yes, Dr Watson - if you would have the goodness to put the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Japan&t=h'>Japan</a>ese vase to one side. </span>
<span sid='57032' title='57032'>You see round me my little interests in life. </span>
<span sid='57033' title='57033'>My doctor lectures me about never going out, but why should I go out when I have so much to hold me here? </span>
<span sid='57034' title='57034'>I can assure you that the adequate cataloguing of one of those cabinets would take me three good months.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57035' title='57035'>Holmes looked round him with curiosity.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57036' title='57036'>'But do you tell me that you never go out?' he said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57037' title='57037'>'Now and again I drive down to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sotheby's&t=h'>Sotheby's</a> or Christie's. </span>
<span sid='57038' title='57038'>Otherwise I very seldom leave my room. </span>
<span sid='57039' title='57039'>I am not too strong, and my researches are very absorbing. </span>
<span sid='57040' title='57040'>But you can imagine, Mr Holmes, what a terrific shock - pleasant but terrific - it was for me when I heard of this unparalleled good fortune. </span>
<span sid='57041' title='57041'>It only needs one more Garrideb to complete the matter, and surely we can find one. </span>
<span sid='57042' title='57042'>I had a brother, but he is dead, and female relatives are disqualified. </span>
<span sid='57043' title='57043'>But there must surely be others in the world. </span>
<span sid='57044' title='57044'>I had heard that you handled strange cases, and that was why I sent to you. </span>
<span sid='57045' title='57045'>Of course, this <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n gentleman is quite right, and I should have taken his advice first, but I acted for the best.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57046' title='57046'>'I think you acted very wisely indeed,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='57047' title='57047'>'But are you really anxious to acquire an estate in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57048' title='57048'>'Certainly not, sir. </span>
<span sid='57049' title='57049'>Nothing would induce me to leave my collection. </span>
<span sid='57050' title='57050'>But this gentleman has assured me that he will buy me out as soon as we have established our claim. </span>
<span sid='57051' title='57051'>Five million dollars was the sum named. </span>
<span sid='57052' title='57052'>There are a dozen specimens in the market at the present moment which fill gaps in my collection, and which I am unable to purchase for want of a few hundred pounds. </span>
<span sid='57053' title='57053'>Just think what I could do with five million dollars. </span>
<span sid='57054' title='57054'>Why, I have the nucleus of a national collection. </span>
<span sid='57055' title='57055'>I shall be the Hans Sloane of my age.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57056' title='57056'>His eyes gleamed behind his spectacles. </span>
<span sid='57057' title='57057'>It was very clear that no pains would be spared by Mr Nathan Garrideb in finding a namesake.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57058' title='57058'>'I merely called to make your acquaintance, and there is no reason why I should interrupt your studies,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='57059' title='57059'>'I prefer to establish personal touch with those with whom I do business. </span>
<span sid='57060' title='57060'>There are few questions I need ask, for I have your very clear narrative in my pocket, and I filled up the blanks when this <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n gentleman called. </span>
<span sid='57061' title='57061'>I understand that up to this week you were unaware of his existence.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57062' title='57062'>'That is so. </span>
<span sid='57063' title='57063'>He called last Tuesday.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57064' title='57064'>'Did he tell you of our interview to-day?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57065' title='57065'>'Yes, he came straight back to me. </span>
<span sid='57066' title='57066'>He had been very angry.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57067' title='57067'>'Why should he be angry?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57068' title='57068'>'He seemed to think it was some reflection on his honour. </span>
<span sid='57069' title='57069'>But he was quite cheerful again when he returned.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57070' title='57070'>'Did he suggest any course of action?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57071' title='57071'>'No, sir, he did not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57072' title='57072'>'Has he had, or asked for, any money from you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57073' title='57073'>'No, sir, never!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57074' title='57074'>'You see no possible object he has in view?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57075' title='57075'>'None, except what he states.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57076' title='57076'>'Did you tell him of our telephone appointment?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57077' title='57077'>'Yes, sir, I did.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57078' title='57078'>Holmes was lost in thought. </span>
<span sid='57079' title='57079'>I could see that he was puzzled.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57080' title='57080'>'Have you any articles of great value in your collection?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57081' title='57081'>'No, sir. </span>
<span sid='57082' title='57082'>I am not a rich man. </span>
<span sid='57083' title='57083'>It is a good collection, but not a very valuable one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57084' title='57084'>'You have no fear of burglars?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57085' title='57085'>'Not the least.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57086' title='57086'>'How long have you been in these rooms?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57087' title='57087'>'Nearly five years.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57088' title='57088'>Holmes's cross-examination was interrupted by an imperative knocking at the door. </span>
<span sid='57089' title='57089'>No sooner had our client unlatched it than the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n lawyer burst excitedly into the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57090' title='57090'>'Here you are!' he cried, waving a paper over his head. </span>
<span sid='57091' title='57091'>'I thought I should be in time to get you. </span>
<span sid='57092' title='57092'>Mr Nathan Garrideb, my congratulations! </span>
<span sid='57093' title='57093'>You are a rich man, sir. </span>
<span sid='57094' title='57094'>Our business is happily finished and all is well. </span>
<span sid='57095' title='57095'>As to you, Mr Holmes, we can only say we are sorry if we have given you any useless trouble.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57096' title='57096'>He handed over the paper to our client, who stood staring at a marked advertisement. </span>
<span sid='57097' title='57097'>Holmes and I leaned forward and read it over his shoulder. </span>
<span sid='57098' title='57098'>This is how it ran:</span>
<p>
<span sid='57099' title='57099'>HOWARD GARRIDEB</span>
<p>
<span sid='57100' title='57100'>Constructor of Agricultural Machinery</span>
<p>
<span sid='57101' title='57101'>Binders, reapers' steam and hand plows, drills, harrows, farmers' carts, buckboards, and all other appliances</span>
<p>
<span sid='57102' title='57102'>Estimates for Artesian Wells</span>
<p>
<span sid='57103' title='57103'>Apply Grosvenor Buildings, Aston</span>
<p>
<span sid='57104' title='57104'>'Glorious!' gasped our host. </span>
<span sid='57105' title='57105'>'That makes our third man.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57106' title='57106'>'I had opened up inquiries in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Birmingham&t=h'>Birmingham</a>,' said the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n, 'and my agent there has sent me this advertisement from a local paper. </span>
<span sid='57107' title='57107'>We must hustle and put the thing through. </span>
<span sid='57108' title='57108'>I have written to this man and told him that you will see him in his office to-morrow afternoon at four o'clock.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57109' title='57109'>'You want me to see him?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57110' title='57110'>'What do you say, Mr Holmes? </span>
<span sid='57111' title='57111'>Don't you think it would be wiser? </span>
<span sid='57112' title='57112'>Here am I, a wandering <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n with a wonderful tale. </span>
<span sid='57113' title='57113'>Why should he believe what I tell him? </span>
<span sid='57114' title='57114'>But you are a Britisher with solid references, and he is bound to take notice of what you say. </span>
<span sid='57115' title='57115'>I would go with you if you wished, but I have a very busy day to-morrow, and I could always follow you if you are in any trouble.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57116' title='57116'>'Well, I have not made such a journey for years.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57117' title='57117'>'It is nothing, Mr Garrideb. </span>
<span sid='57118' title='57118'>I have figured out your connections. </span>
<span sid='57119' title='57119'>You leave at twelve and should be there soon after two. </span>
<span sid='57120' title='57120'>Then you can be back the same night. </span>
<span sid='57121' title='57121'>All you have to do is to see this man, explain the matter, and get an affidavit of his existence. </span>
<span sid='57122' title='57122'>By the Lord!' he added hotly, 'considering I've come all the way from the centre of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>, it is surely little enough if you go a hundred miles in order to put this matter through.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57123' title='57123'>'Quite so,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='57124' title='57124'>'I think what this gentleman says is very true.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57125' title='57125'>Mr Nathan Garrideb shrugged his shoulders with a disconsolate air. </span>
<span sid='57126' title='57126'>'Well, if you insist I shall go,' said he. </span>
<span sid='57127' title='57127'>'It is certainly hard for me to refuse you anything, considering the glory of hope that you have brought into my life.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57128' title='57128'>'Then that is agreed,' said Holmes, 'and no doubt you will let me have a report as soon as you can.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57129' title='57129'>'I'll see to that,' said the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n. </span>
<span sid='57130' title='57130'>'Well,' he added, looking at his watch, 'I'll have to get on. </span>
<span sid='57131' title='57131'>I'll call to-morrow, Mr Nathan, and see you off to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Birmingham&t=h'>Birmingham</a>. </span>
<span sid='57132' title='57132'>Coming my way, Mr Holmes? </span>
<span sid='57133' title='57133'>Well, then, good-bye, and we may have good news for you to-morrow night.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57134' title='57134'>I noticed that my friend's face cleared when the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n left the room, and the look of thoughtful perplexity had vanished.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57135' title='57135'>'I wish I could look over your collection, Mr Garrideb,' said he. </span>
<span sid='57136' title='57136'>'In my profession all sorts of odd knowledge comes useful, and this room of yours is a storehouse of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57137' title='57137'>Our client shone with pleasure and his eyes gleamed from behind his big glasses.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57138' title='57138'>'I had always heard, sir, that you were a very intelligent man,' said he. </span>
<span sid='57139' title='57139'>'I could take you round now, if you have the time.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57140' title='57140'>'Unfortunately, I have not. </span>
<span sid='57141' title='57141'>But these specimens are so well labelled and classified that they hardly need your personal explanation. </span>
<span sid='57142' title='57142'>If I should be able to look in to-morrow, I presume that there would be no objection to my glancing over them?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57143' title='57143'>'None at all. </span>
<span sid='57144' title='57144'>You are most welcome. </span>
<span sid='57145' title='57145'>The place will, of course, be shut up, but Mrs Saunders is in the basement up to four o'clock and would let you in with her key.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57146' title='57146'>'Well, I happen to be clear to-morrow afternoon. </span>
<span sid='57147' title='57147'>If you would say a word to Mrs Saunders it would be quite in order. </span>
<span sid='57148' title='57148'>By the way, who is your house-agent?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57149' title='57149'>Our client was amazed at the sudden question.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57150' title='57150'>'Holloway and Steele, in the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Edgware Road&t=h'>Edgware Road</a>. </span>
<span sid='57151' title='57151'>But why?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57152' title='57152'>'I am a bit of an archaeologist myself when it comes to houses,' said Holmes, laughing. </span>
<span sid='57153' title='57153'>'I was wondering if this was Queen Anne or <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Georgia&t=h'>Georgia</a>n.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57154' title='57154'>'<a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Georgia&t=h'>Georgia</a>n, beyond doubt.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57155' title='57155'>'Really. </span>
<span sid='57156' title='57156'>I should have thought a little earlier. </span>
<span sid='57157' title='57157'>However, it is easily ascertained. </span>
<span sid='57158' title='57158'>Well, good-bye, Mr Garrideb, and may you have every success in your <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Birmingham&t=h'>Birmingham</a> journey.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57159' title='57159'>The house-agent's was close by, but we found that it was closed for the day, so we made our way back to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>. </span>
<span sid='57160' title='57160'>It was not till after dinner that Holmes reverted to the subject.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57161' title='57161'>'Our little problem draws to a close,' said he. </span>
<span sid='57162' title='57162'>'No doubt you have outlined the solution in your own mind.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57163' title='57163'>'I can make neither head nor tail of it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57164' title='57164'>'The head is surely clear enough and the tail we should see to-morrow. </span>
<span sid='57165' title='57165'>Did you notice nothing curious about that advertisement?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57166' title='57166'>'I saw that the word "plough" was mis-spelt.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57167' title='57167'>'Oh, you did notice that, did you? </span>
<span sid='57168' title='57168'>Come, Watson, you improve all the time. </span>
<span sid='57169' title='57169'>Yes, it was bad English but good <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n. </span>
<span sid='57170' title='57170'>The printer had set it up as received. </span>
<span sid='57171' title='57171'>Then the buckboards. </span>
<span sid='57172' title='57172'>That is <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n also. </span>
<span sid='57173' title='57173'>And artesian wells are commoner with them than with us. </span>
<span sid='57174' title='57174'>It was a typical <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n advertisement, but purporting to be from an English firm. </span>
<span sid='57175' title='57175'>What do you make of that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57176' title='57176'>'I can only suppose that this <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n lawyer put it in himself. </span>
<span sid='57177' title='57177'>What his object was I fail to understand.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57178' title='57178'>'Well, there are alternative explanations. </span>
<span sid='57179' title='57179'>Anyhow, he wanted to get this good old fossil up to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Birmingham&t=h'>Birmingham</a>. </span>
<span sid='57180' title='57180'>That is very clear. </span>
<span sid='57181' title='57181'>I might have told him that he was clearly going on a wild-goose chase, but, on second thoughts, it seemed better to clear the stage by letting him go. </span>
<span sid='57182' title='57182'>To-morrow, Watson - well, to-morrow will speak for itself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57183' title='57183'>Holmes was up and out early. </span>
<span sid='57184' title='57184'>When he returned at lunchtime I noticed that his face was very grave.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57185' title='57185'>'This is a more serious matter than I had expected, Watson,' said he. </span>
<span sid='57186' title='57186'>'It is fair to tell you so, though I know it will be only an additional reason to you for running your head into danger. </span>
<span sid='57187' title='57187'>I should know my Watson by now. </span>
<span sid='57188' title='57188'>But there is danger, and you should know it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57189' title='57189'>'Well, it is not the first we have shared, Holmes. </span>
<span sid='57190' title='57190'>I hope it may not be the last. </span>
<span sid='57191' title='57191'>What is the particular danger this time?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57192' title='57192'>'We are up against a very hard case. </span>
<span sid='57193' title='57193'>I have identified Mr John Garrideb, Counsellor at Law. </span>
<span sid='57194' title='57194'>He is none other than "Killer" Evans, of sinister and murderous reputation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57195' title='57195'>'I fear I am none the wiser.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57196' title='57196'>'Ah, it is not part of your profession to carry about a portable Newgate Calendar in your memory. </span>
<span sid='57197' title='57197'>I have been down to see friend Lestrade at the Yard. </span>
<span sid='57198' title='57198'>There may be an occasional want of imaginative intuition down there, but they lead the world for thoroughness and method. </span>
<span sid='57199' title='57199'>I had an idea that we might get on the track of our <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n friend in their records. </span>
<span sid='57200' title='57200'>Sure enough, I found his chubby face smiling up at me from the Rogues' Portrait Gallery. </span>
<span sid='57201' title='57201'>James Winter, alias Morecroft, alias Killer Evans, was the inscription below.' </span>
<span sid='57202' title='57202'>Holmes drew an envelope from his pocket. </span>
<span sid='57203' title='57203'>'I scribbled down a few points from his dossier. </span>
<span sid='57204' title='57204'>Aged forty-six. </span>
<span sid='57205' title='57205'>Native of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>. </span>
<span sid='57206' title='57206'>Known to have shot three men in the States. </span>
<span sid='57207' title='57207'>Escaped from penitentiary through political influence. </span>
<span sid='57208' title='57208'>Came to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> in 1893. </span>
<span sid='57209' title='57209'>Shot a man over cards in a night-club in the Waterloo Road in January, 1895. </span>
<span sid='57210' title='57210'>Man died, but he was shown to have been the aggressor in the row. </span>
<span sid='57211' title='57211'>Dead man was identified as Rodger Prescott, famous as forger and coiner in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Chicago&t=h'>Chicago</a>. </span>
<span sid='57212' title='57212'>Killer Evans released in 1901. </span>
<span sid='57213' title='57213'>Has been under police supervision since, but so far as known has led an honest life. </span>
<span sid='57214' title='57214'>Very dangerous man, usually carries arms and is prepared to use them. </span>
<span sid='57215' title='57215'>That is our bird, Watson - a sporting bird, as you must admit.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57216' title='57216'>'But what is his game?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57217' title='57217'>'Well, it begins to define itself. </span>
<span sid='57218' title='57218'>I have been to the houseagents. </span>
<span sid='57219' title='57219'>Our client, as he told us, has been there five years. </span>
<span sid='57220' title='57220'>It was unlet for a year before then. </span>
<span sid='57221' title='57221'>The previous tenant was a gentleman at large named Waldron. </span>
<span sid='57222' title='57222'>Waldron's appearance was well remembered at the office. </span>
<span sid='57223' title='57223'>He had suddenly vanished and nothing more been heard of him. </span>
<span sid='57224' title='57224'>He was a tall, bearded man with very dark features. </span>
<span sid='57225' title='57225'>Now, Prescott, the man whom Killer Evans had shot, was, according to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Scotland Yard&t=h'>Scotland Yard</a>, a tall, dark man with a beard. </span>
<span sid='57226' title='57226'>As a working hypothesis, I think we may take it that Prescott, the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n criminal, used to live in the very room which our innocent friend now devotes to his museum. </span>
<span sid='57227' title='57227'>So at last we get a link, you see.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57228' title='57228'>'And the next link?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57229' title='57229'>'Well, we must go now and look for that.' </span>
<span sid='57230' title='57230'>He took a revolver from the drawer and handed it to me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57231' title='57231'>'I have my old favourite with me. </span>
<span sid='57232' title='57232'>If our Wild West friend tries to live up to his nickname, we must be ready for him. </span>
<span sid='57233' title='57233'>I'll give you an hour for a siesta, Watson, and then I think it will be time for our Ryder Street adventure.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57234' title='57234'>It was just four o'clock when we reached the curious apartment of Nathan Garrideb. </span>
<span sid='57235' title='57235'>Mrs Saunders, the caretaker, was about to leave, but she had no hesitation in admitting us, for the door shut with a spring lock and Holmes promised to see that all was safe before we left. </span>
<span sid='57236' title='57236'>Shortly afterwards the outer door closed, her bonnet passed the bow window, and we knew that we were alone in the lower floor of the house. </span>
<span sid='57237' title='57237'>Holmes made a rapid examination of the premises. </span>
<span sid='57238' title='57238'>There was one cupboard in a dark corner which stood out a little from the wall. </span>
<span sid='57239' title='57239'>It was behind this that we eventually crouched, while Holmes in a whisper outlined his intentions.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57240' title='57240'>'He wanted to get our amiable friend out of his room-that is very clear, and, as the collector never went out, it took some planning to do it. </span>
<span sid='57241' title='57241'>The whole of this Garrideb invention was apparently for no other end. </span>
<span sid='57242' title='57242'>I must say, Watson, that there is a certain devilish ingenuity about it, even if the queer name of the tenant did give him an opening which he could hardly have expected. </span>
<span sid='57243' title='57243'>He wove his plot with remarkable cunning.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57244' title='57244'>'But what did he want?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57245' title='57245'>'Well, that is what we are here to find out. </span>
<span sid='57246' title='57246'>It has nothing whatever to do with our client, so far as I can read the situation. </span>
<span sid='57247' title='57247'>It is something connected with the man he murdered - the man who may have been his confederate in crime. </span>
<span sid='57248' title='57248'>There is some guilty secret in the room. </span>
<span sid='57249' title='57249'>That is how I read it. </span>
<span sid='57250' title='57250'>At first I thought our friend might have something in his collection more valuable than he knew - something worth the attention of a big criminal. </span>
<span sid='57251' title='57251'>But the fact that Rodger Prescott of evil memory inhabited these rooms points to some deeper reason. </span>
<span sid='57252' title='57252'>Well, Watson, we can but possess our souls in patience and see what the hour may bring.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57253' title='57253'>That hour was not long in striking. </span>
<span sid='57254' title='57254'>We crouched closer in the shadow as we heard the outer door open and shut. </span>
<span sid='57255' title='57255'>Then came the sharp, metallic snap of a key, and the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n was in the room. </span>
<span sid='57256' title='57256'>He closed the door softly behind him, took a sharp glance around him to see that all was safe, threw off his overcoat, and walked up to the central table with the brisk manner of one who knows exactly what he has to do and how to do it. </span>
<span sid='57257' title='57257'>He pushed the table to one side, tore up the square of carpet on which it rested, rolled it completely back, and then, drawing a jemmy from his inside pocket, he knelt down and worked vigorously upon the floor. </span>
<span sid='57258' title='57258'>Presently we heard the sound of sliding boards, and an instant later a square had opened in the planks. </span>
<span sid='57259' title='57259'>Killer Evans struck a match, lit a stump of candle, and vanished from our view.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57260' title='57260'>Clearly our moment had come. </span>
<span sid='57261' title='57261'>Holmes touched my wrist as a signal, and together we stole across to the open trap-door. </span>
<span sid='57262' title='57262'>Gently as we moved, however, the old floor must have creaked under our feet, for the head of our <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=America&t=h'>America</a>n, peering anxiously round, emerged suddenly from the open space. </span>
<span sid='57263' title='57263'>His face turned upon us with a glare of baffled rage, which gradually softened into a rather shamefaced grin as he realized that two pistols were pointed at his head.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57264' title='57264'>'Well, well!' said he, coolly, as he scrambled to the surface. </span>
<span sid='57265' title='57265'>'I guess you have been one too many for me, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='57266' title='57266'>Saw through my game, I suppose, and played me for a sucker from the first. </span>
<span sid='57267' title='57267'>Well, sir, I hand it to you, you have me beat and-'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57268' title='57268'>In an instant he had whisked out a revolver from his breast and had fired two shots. </span>
<span sid='57269' title='57269'>I felt a sudden hot sear as if a red-hot iron had been pressed to my thigh. </span>
<span sid='57270' title='57270'>There was a crash as Holmes's pistol came down on the man's head. </span>
<span sid='57271' title='57271'>I had a vision of him sprawling upon the floor with blood running down his face while Holmes rummaged him for weapons. </span>
<span sid='57272' title='57272'>Then my friend's wiry arms were round me and he was leading me to a chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57273' title='57273'>'You're not hurt, Watson? </span>
<span sid='57274' title='57274'>For God's sake, say that you are not hurt!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57275' title='57275'>It was worth a wound - it was worth many wounds - to know the depth of loyalty and love which lay behind that cold mask. </span>
<span sid='57276' title='57276'>The clear, hard eyes were dimmed for a moment, and the firm lips were shaking. </span>
<span sid='57277' title='57277'>For the one and only time I caught a glimpse of a great heart as well as of a great brain. </span>
<span sid='57278' title='57278'>All my years of humble but single-minded service culminated in that moment of revelation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57279' title='57279'>'It's nothing, Holmes. </span>
<span sid='57280' title='57280'>It's a mere scratch.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57281' title='57281'>He had ripped up my trousers with his pocket-knife.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57282' title='57282'>'You are right,' he cried, with an immense sigh of relief. </span>
<span sid='57283' title='57283'>'It is quite superficial.' </span>
<span sid='57284' title='57284'>His face set like flint as he glared at our prisoner, who was sitting up with a dazed face. </span>
<span sid='57285' title='57285'>'By the Lord, it is as well for you. </span>
<span sid='57286' title='57286'>If you had killed Watson, you would not have got out of this room alive. </span>
<span sid='57287' title='57287'>Now, sir, what have you to say for yourself?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57288' title='57288'>He had nothing to say for himself. </span>
<span sid='57289' title='57289'>He only lay and scowled. </span>
<span sid='57290' title='57290'>I leaned on Holmes's arm, and together we looked down into the small cellar which had been disclosed by the secret flap. </span>
<span sid='57291' title='57291'>It was still illuminated by the candle which Evans had taken down with him. </span>
<span sid='57292' title='57292'>Our eyes fell upon a mass of rusted machinery, great rolls of paper, a litter of bottles, and, neatly arranged upon a small table, a number of neat little bundles.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57293' title='57293'>'A printing press - a counterfeiter's outfit,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57294' title='57294'>'Yes, sir,' said our prisoner, staggering slowly to his feet and then sinking into the chair. </span>
<span sid='57295' title='57295'>'The greatest counterfeiter <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> ever saw. </span>
<span sid='57296' title='57296'>That's Prescott's machine, and those bundles on the table are two thousand of Prescott's notes worth a hundred each and fit to pass anywhere. </span>
<span sid='57297' title='57297'>Help yourselves, gentlemen. </span>
<span sid='57298' title='57298'>Call it a deal and let me beat it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57299' title='57299'>Holmes laughed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='57300' title='57300'>'We don't do things like that, Mr Evans. </span>
<span sid='57301' title='57301'>There is no bolt-hole for you in this country. </span>
<span sid='57302' title='57302'>You shot this man Prescott, did you not?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57303' title='57303'>'Yes, sir, and got five years for it, though it was he who pulled on me. </span>
<span sid='57304' title='57304'>Five years - when I should have had a medal the size of a soup plate. </span>
<span sid='57305' title='57305'>No living man could tell a Prescott from a Bank of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, and if I hadn't put him out he would have flooded <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> with them. </span>
<span sid='57306' title='57306'>I was the only one in the world who knew where he made them. </span>
<span sid='57307' title='57307'>Can you wonder that I wanted to get to the place? </span>
<span sid='57308' title='57308'>And can you wonder that when I found this crazy boob of a bug-hunter with the queer name squatting right on the top of it, and never quitting his room, I had to do the best I could to shift him? </span>
<span sid='57309' title='57309'>Maybe I would have been wiser if I had put him away. </span>
<span sid='57310' title='57310'>It would have been easy enough, but I'm a soft-hearted guy that can't begin shooting unless the other man has a gun also. </span>
<span sid='57311' title='57311'>But say, Mr Holmes, what have I done wrong, anyhow? </span>
<span sid='57312' title='57312'>I've not used this plant. </span>
<span sid='57313' title='57313'>I've not hurt this old stiff. </span>
<span sid='57314' title='57314'>Where do you get me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57315' title='57315'>'Only attempted murder, so far as I can see,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='57316' title='57316'>'But that's not our job. </span>
<span sid='57317' title='57317'>They take that at the next stage. </span>
<span sid='57318' title='57318'>What we wanted at present was just your sweet self. </span>
<span sid='57319' title='57319'>Please give the Yard a call, Watson. </span>
<span sid='57320' title='57320'>It won't be entirely unexpected.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='57321' title='57321'>So those were the facts about Killer Evans and his remarkable invention of the three Garridebs. </span>
<span sid='57322' title='57322'>We heard later that our poor old friend never got over the shock of his dissipated dreams. </span>
<span sid='57323' title='57323'>When his castle in the air fell down, it buried him beneath the ruins. </span>
<span sid='57324' title='57324'>He was last heard of at a nursing-home in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Brixton&t=h'>Brixton</a>. </span>
<span sid='57325' title='57325'>It was a glad day at the Yard when the Prescott outfit was discovered, for, though they knew that it existed, they had never been able, after the death of the man, to find out where it was. </span>
<span sid='57326' title='57326'>Evans had indeed done great service, and caused several worthy CID men to sleep the sounder, for the counterfeiter stands in a class by himself as a public danger. </span>
<span sid='57327' title='57327'>They would willingly have subscribed to that soup-plate medal of which the criminal had spoken, but an unappreciative Bench took a less favourable view, and the Killer returned to those shades from which he had just emerged.</span>
