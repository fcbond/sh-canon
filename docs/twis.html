<p>
<span sid='26578' title='26578'>Isa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the Theological College of St George's, was much addicted to opium. </span>
<span sid='26579' title='26579'>The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he was at college, for having read De Quincey's description of his dreams and sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects. </span>
<span sid='26580' title='26580'>He found, as so many more have done, that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. </span>
<span sid='26581' title='26581'>I can see him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26582' title='26582'>One night - it was in June, '89 - there came a ring to my bell, about the hour when a man gives his first yawn, and glances at the clock. </span>
<span sid='26583' title='26583'>I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needlework down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26584' title='26584'>'A patient!' said she. </span>
<span sid='26585' title='26585'>'You'll have to go out.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26586' title='26586'>I groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26587' title='26587'>We heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon the linoleum. </span>
<span sid='26588' title='26588'>Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some dark-coloured stuff with a black veil, entered the room.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26589' title='26589'>'You will excuse my calling so late,' she began, and then, suddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my wife's neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. </span>
<span sid='26590' title='26590'>'Oh! </span>
<span sid='26591' title='26591'>I'm in such trouble!' she cried; 'I do so want a little help.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26592' title='26592'>'Why,' said my wife, pulling up her veil, 'It is Kate Whitney. </span>
<span sid='26593' title='26593'>How you startled me, Kate! </span>
<span sid='26594' title='26594'>I had not an idea who you were when you came in.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26595' title='26595'>'I didn't know what to do, so I came straight to you.' </span>
<span sid='26596' title='26596'>That was always the way. </span>
<span sid='26597' title='26597'>Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a lighthouse.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26598' title='26598'>'It was very sweet of you to come. </span>
<span sid='26599' title='26599'>Now, you must have some wine and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. </span>
<span sid='26600' title='26600'>Or should you rather that I sent James off to bed?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26601' title='26601'>'Oh, no, no. </span>
<span sid='26602' title='26602'>I want the Doctor's advice and help too. </span>
<span sid='26603' title='26603'>It's about Isa. </span>
<span sid='26604' title='26604'>He has not been home for two days. </span>
<span sid='26605' title='26605'>I am so frightened about him!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26606' title='26606'>It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband's trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school companion. </span>
<span sid='26607' title='26607'>We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find. </span>
<span sid='26608' title='26608'>Did she know where her husband was? </span>
<span sid='26609' title='26609'>Was it possible that we could bring him back to her?</span>
<p>
<span sid='26610' title='26610'>It seemed that it was. </span>
<span sid='26611' title='26611'>She had the surest information that of late he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the furthest east of the City. </span>
<span sid='26612' title='26612'>Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. </span>
<span sid='26613' title='26613'>But now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless, among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects. </span>
<span sid='26614' title='26614'>There he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the 'Bar of Gold', in Upper Swandam Lane. </span>
<span sid='26615' title='26615'>But what was she to do? </span>
<span sid='26616' title='26616'>How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place, and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?</span>
<p>
<span sid='26617' title='26617'>There was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it. </span>
<span sid='26618' title='26618'>Might I not escort her to this place? </span>
<span sid='26619' title='26619'>And then, as a second thought, why should she come at all? </span>
<span sid='26620' title='26620'>I was Isa Whitney's medical adviser, and as such I had influence over him. </span>
<span sid='26621' title='26621'>I could manage it better if I were alone. </span>
<span sid='26622' title='26622'>I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me. </span>
<span sid='26623' title='26623'>And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only could show how strange it was to be.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26624' title='26624'>But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure. </span>
<span sid='26625' title='26625'>Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> Bridge. </span>
<span sid='26626' title='26626'>Between a slop shop, and a gin shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search. </span>
<span sid='26627' title='26627'>Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet, and by the light of a flickering oil lamp above the door I found the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26628' title='26628'>Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back and chins pointing upwards, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. </span>
<span sid='26629' title='26629'>Out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. </span>
<span sid='26630' title='26630'>The most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts, and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. </span>
<span sid='26631' title='26631'>At the further end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into the fire.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26632' title='26632'>As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26633' title='26633'>'Thank you, I have not come to stay,' said I. </span>
<span sid='26634' title='26634'>'There is a friend of mine here, Mr Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26635' title='26635'>There was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and, peering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out at me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26636' title='26636'>'My God! </span>
<span sid='26637' title='26637'>It's Watson,' said he. </span>
<span sid='26638' title='26638'>He was in a pitiable state of reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. </span>
<span sid='26639' title='26639'>'I say, Watson, what o'clock is it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26640' title='26640'>'Nearly eleven.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26641' title='26641'>'Of what day?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26642' title='26642'>'Of Friday, June 19th.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26643' title='26643'>'Good heavens! </span>
<span sid='26644' title='26644'>I thought it was Wednesday. </span>
<span sid='26645' title='26645'>It is Wednesday. </span>
<span sid='26646' title='26646'>What d'you want to frighten a chap for?' </span>
<span sid='26647' title='26647'>He sank his face on to his arms, and began to sob in a high treble key.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26648' title='26648'>'I tell you that it is Friday, man. </span>
<span sid='26649' title='26649'>Your wife has been waiting this two days for you. </span>
<span sid='26650' title='26650'>You should be ashamed of yourself!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26651' title='26651'>'So I am. </span>
<span sid='26652' title='26652'>But you've got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few hours, three pipes, four pipes - I forget how many. </span>
<span sid='26653' title='26653'>But I'll go home with you. </span>
<span sid='26654' title='26654'>I wouldn't frighten Kate - poor little Kate. </span>
<span sid='26655' title='26655'>Give me your hand! </span>
<span sid='26656' title='26656'>Have you a cab?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26657' title='26657'>'Yes, I have one waiting.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26658' title='26658'>'Then I shall go in it. </span>
<span sid='26659' title='26659'>But I must owe something. </span>
<span sid='26660' title='26660'>Find what I owe, Watson. </span>
<span sid='26661' title='26661'>I am all off colour. </span>
<span sid='26662' title='26662'>I can do nothing for myself.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26663' title='26663'>I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. </span>
<span sid='26664' title='26664'>As I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, 'Walk past me, and then look back at me.' </span>
<span sid='26665' title='26665'>The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. </span>
<span sid='26666' title='26666'>I glanced down. </span>
<span sid='26667' title='26667'>They could only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers. </span>
<span sid='26668' title='26668'>I took two steps forward and looked back. </span>
<span sid='26669' title='26669'>It took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment. </span>
<span sid='26670' title='26670'>He had turned his back so that none could see him but I. </span>
<span sid='26671' title='26671'>His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire, and grinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='26672' title='26672'>He made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose lipped senility.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26673' title='26673'>'Holmes!' </span>
<span sid='26674' title='26674'>I whispered what on earth are you doing in this den?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26675' title='26675'>'As low as you can,' he answered, have excellent ears. </span>
<span sid='26676' title='26676'>If you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours, I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26677' title='26677'>'I have a cab outside.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26678' title='26678'>'Then pray send him home in it. </span>
<span sid='26679' title='26679'>You may safely trust him, for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. </span>
<span sid='26680' title='26680'>I should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me. </span>
<span sid='26681' title='26681'>If you will wait outside, I shall be with you in five minutes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26682' title='26682'>It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes's requests, for they were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such an air of mastery. </span>
<span sid='26683' title='26683'>I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined in the cab, my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence. </span>
<span sid='26684' title='26684'>In a few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney's bill, led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. </span>
<span sid='26685' title='26685'>In a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. </span>
<span sid='26686' title='26686'>For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. </span>
<span sid='26687' title='26687'>Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26688' title='26688'>'I suppose, Watson,' said he, 'that you imagine that I have added opium-smoking to cocaine injections and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26689' title='26689'>'I was certainly surprised to find you there.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26690' title='26690'>'But not more so than I to find you.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26691' title='26691'>'I came to find a friend.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26692' title='26692'>'And I to find an enemy!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26693' title='26693'>'An enemy?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26694' title='26694'>'Yes, one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey. </span>
<span sid='26695' title='26695'>Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. </span>
<span sid='26696' title='26696'>Had I been recognized in that den my life would not have been worth an hour's purchase, for I have used it before now for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn vengeance upon me. </span>
<span sid='26697' title='26697'>There is a trap-door at the back of that building, near the corner of Paul's Wharf, which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26698' title='26698'>'What! </span>
<span sid='26699' title='26699'>You do not mean bodies?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26700' title='26700'>'Aye, bodies, Watson. </span>
<span sid='26701' title='26701'>We should be rich men if we had a thousand pounds for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. </span>
<span sid='26702' title='26702'>It is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear Neville St Clair has entered it never to leave it more. </span>
<span sid='26703' title='26703'>But our trap should be here!' </span>
<span sid='26704' title='26704'>He put his two fore-fingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly, a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horse's hoofs.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26705' title='26705'>'Now, Watson,' said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side-lanterns, 'you'll come with me, won't you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26706' title='26706'>'If I can be of use.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26707' title='26707'>'Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use. </span>
<span sid='26708' title='26708'>And a chronicler still more so. </span>
<span sid='26709' title='26709'>My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26710' title='26710'>'The Cedars?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26711' title='26711'>'Yes; that is Mr St Clair's house. </span>
<span sid='26712' title='26712'>I am staying there while I conduct the inquiry.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26713' title='26713'>'Where is it, then?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26714' title='26714'>'Near Lee, in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kent&t=h'>Kent</a>. </span>
<span sid='26715' title='26715'>We have a seven-mile drive before us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26716' title='26716'>'But I am all in the dark.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26717' title='26717'>'Of course you are. </span>
<span sid='26718' title='26718'>You'll know all about it presently. </span>
<span sid='26719' title='26719'>Jump up here! </span>
<span sid='26720' title='26720'>All right, John, we shall not need you. </span>
<span sid='26721' title='26721'>Here's half-a-crown. </span>
<span sid='26722' title='26722'>Look out for me to-morrow about eleven. </span>
<span sid='26723' title='26723'>Give her her head! </span>
<span sid='26724' title='26724'>So long, then!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26725' title='26725'>He flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. </span>
<span sid='26726' title='26726'>Beyond lay another broad wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers. </span>
<span sid='26727' title='26727'>A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds. </span>
<span sid='26728' title='26728'>Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, whilst I sat beside him curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts. </span>
<span sid='26729' title='26729'>We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26730' title='26730'>'You have a grand gift of silence, Watson,' said he. </span>
<span sid='26731' title='26731'>'It makes you quite invaluable as a companion. </span>
<span sid='26732' title='26732'>'Pon my word, it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant. </span>
<span sid='26733' title='26733'>I was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman to-night when she meets me at the door.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26734' title='26734'>'You forget that I know nothing about it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26735' title='26735'>'I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to Lee. </span>
<span sid='26736' title='26736'>It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow, I can get nothing to go upon. </span>
<span sid='26737' title='26737'>There's plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can't get the end of it in my hand. </span>
<span sid='26738' title='26738'>Now, I'll state the case clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you may see a spark where all is dark to me.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26739' title='26739'>'Proceed, then.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26740' title='26740'>'Some years ago - to be definite, in May, 1884 - there came to Lee a gentleman, Neville St Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of money. </span>
<span sid='26741' title='26741'>He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and lived generally in good style. </span>
<span sid='26742' title='26742'>By degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he has now had two children. </span>
<span sid='26743' title='26743'>He had no occupation, but was interested in several companies, and went into town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5.14 from Cannon Street every night. </span>
<span sid='26744' title='26744'>Mr St Clair is now 37 years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know him. </span>
<span sid='26745' title='26745'>I may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to £88 10s., while he has £220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank. </span>
<span sid='26746' title='26746'>There is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26747' title='26747'>'Last Monday Mr Neville St Clair went into town rather earlier than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks. </span>
<span sid='26748' title='26748'>Now, by the merest chance his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Aberdeen&t=h'>Aberdeen</a> Shipping Company. </span>
<span sid='26749' title='26749'>Now, if you are well up in your <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>, you will know that the office of the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where you found me to-night. </span>
<span sid='26750' title='26750'>Mrs St Clair had her lunch, started for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the Company's office, got her packet, and found herself exactly at 4.35 walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. </span>
<span sid='26751' title='26751'>Have you followed me so far?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26752' title='26752'>'It is very clear.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26753' title='26753'>'If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs St Clair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself. </span>
<span sid='26754' title='26754'>While she walked in this way down Swandam Lane she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her, and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor window. </span>
<span sid='26755' title='26755'>The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly agitated. </span>
<span sid='26756' title='26756'>He waved his hands frantically to her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind. </span>
<span sid='26757' title='26757'>One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that, although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26758' title='26758'>'Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the steps - for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me to-night - and, running through the front room, she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. </span>
<span sid='26759' title='26759'>At the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel, of whom I have spoken, who thrust her back, and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. </span>
<span sid='26760' title='26760'>Filled with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane, and, by rare good fortune, met, in Fresno Street, a number of constables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat. </span>
<span sid='26761' title='26761'>The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and, in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to the room in which Mr St Clair had last been seen. </span>
<span sid='26762' title='26762'>There was no sign of him there. </span>
<span sid='26763' title='26763'>In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found, save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems, made his home there. </span>
<span sid='26764' title='26764'>Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during that afternoon. </span>
<span sid='26765' title='26765'>So determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs St Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table, and tore the lid from it. </span>
<span sid='26766' title='26766'>Out there fell a cascade of children's bricks. </span>
<span sid='26767' title='26767'>It was the toy which he had promised to bring home.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26768' title='26768'>'This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made the inspector realize that the matter was serious. </span>
<span sid='26769' title='26769'>The rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. </span>
<span sid='26770' title='26770'>The front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room, and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves. </span>
<span sid='26771' title='26771'>Between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide, but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. </span>
<span sid='26772' title='26772'>The bedroom window was a broad one, and opened from below. </span>
<span sid='26773' title='26773'>On examination traces of blood were - to be seen upon the window-sill, and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom. </span>
<span sid='26774' title='26774'>Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of Mr Neville St Clair, with the exception of his coat. </span>
<span sid='26775' title='26775'>His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch - all were there. </span>
<span sid='26776' title='26776'>There were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other traces of Mr Neville St Clair. </span>
<span sid='26777' title='26777'>Out of the window he must apparently have gone, for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26778' title='26778'>'And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter. </span>
<span sid='26779' title='26779'>The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but as by Mrs St Clair's story he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a few seconds of her husband's appearance at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. </span>
<span sid='26780' title='26780'>His defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman's clothes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26781' title='26781'>'So much for the Lascar manager. </span>
<span sid='26782' title='26782'>Now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St Clair. </span>
<span sid='26783' title='26783'>His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the City. </span>
<span sid='26784' title='26784'>He is a professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. </span>
<span sid='26785' title='26785'>Some little distance down <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Threadneedle Street&t=h'>Threadneedle Street</a> upon the left hand side there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the wall. </span>
<span sid='26786' title='26786'>Here it is that the creature takes his daily seat, cross-legged, with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement before him. </span>
<span sid='26787' title='26787'>I have watched this fellow more than once, before ever I thought of making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in so short a time. </span>
<span sid='26788' title='26788'>His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him. </span>
<span sid='26789' title='26789'>A shock of orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bull-dog chin, and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants, and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passersby. </span>
<span sid='26790' title='26790'>This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26791' title='26791'>'But a cripple!' said I. </span>
<span sid='26792' title='26792'>'What could he have done single-handed against a man in the prime of life?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26793' title='26793'>'He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but, in other respects, he appears to be a powerful and well- nurtured man. </span>
<span sid='26794' title='26794'>Surely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26795' title='26795'>'Pray continue your narrative.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26796' title='26796'>'Mrs St Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations. </span>
<span sid='26797' title='26797'>Inspector Barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter. </span>
<span sid='26798' title='26798'>One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and searched, without anything being found which could incriminate him. </span>
<span sid='26799' title='26799'>There were, it is true, some bloodstains upon his right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring finger, which had been cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source. </span>
<span sid='26800' title='26800'>He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr Neville St Clair, and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police. </span>
<span sid='26801' title='26801'>As to Mrs St Clair's assertion, that she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming. </span>
<span sid='26802' title='26802'>He was removed, loudly protesting, to the police station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26803' title='26803'>'And it did, though they hardly found upon the mudbank what they had feared to find. </span>
<span sid='26804' title='26804'>It was Neville St Clair's coat, and not Neville St Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. </span>
<span sid='26805' title='26805'>And what do you think they found in the pockets?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26806' title='26806'>'I cannot imagine.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26807' title='26807'>'No, I don't think you will guess. </span>
<span sid='26808' title='26808'>Every pocket stuffed with pennies and halfpennies - four hundred and twenty-one pennies, and two hundred and seventy halfpennies. </span>
<span sid='26809' title='26809'>It was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. </span>
<span sid='26810' title='26810'>But a human body is a different matter. </span>
<span sid='26811' title='26811'>There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house. </span>
<span sid='26812' title='26812'>It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26813' title='26813'>'But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room. </span>
<span sid='26814' title='26814'>Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26815' title='26815'>'No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. </span>
<span sid='26816' title='26816'>Suppose that this man Boone had thrust Neville St Clair through the window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed. </span>
<span sid='26817' title='26817'>What would he do then? </span>
<span sid='26818' title='26818'>It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. </span>
<span sid='26819' title='26819'>He would seize the coat then, and be in the act of throwing it out when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. </span>
<span sid='26820' title='26820'>He has little time, for he had heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street. </span>
<span sid='26821' title='26821'>There is not an instant to be lost. </span>
<span sid='26822' title='26822'>He rushes to some secret hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat's sinking. </span>
<span sid='26823' title='26823'>He throws it out, and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26824' title='26824'>'It certainly sounds feasible.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26825' title='26825'>'Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better. </span>
<span sid='26826' title='26826'>Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him. </span>
<span sid='26827' title='26827'>He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. </span>
<span sid='26828' title='26828'>There the matter stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved, what Neville St Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where he is now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance, are all as far from solution as ever. </span>
<span sid='26829' title='26829'>I confess that I cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple, and yet which presented such difficulties.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26830' title='26830'>Whilst Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of events we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us. </span>
<span sid='26831' title='26831'>Just as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26832' title='26832'>'We are on the outskirts of Lee,' said my companion. </span>
<span sid='26833' title='26833'>'We have touched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Middlesex&t=h'>Middlesex</a>, passing over an angle of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Surrey&t=h'>Surrey</a>, and ending in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kent&t=h'>Kent</a>. </span>
<span sid='26834' title='26834'>See that light among the trees? </span>
<span sid='26835' title='26835'>That is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink of our horse's feet.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26836' title='26836'>'But why are you not conducting the case from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a>?' I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26837' title='26837'>'Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here. </span>
<span sid='26838' title='26838'>Mrs St Clair has mostly kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague. </span>
<span sid='26839' title='26839'>I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her husband. </span>
<span sid='26840' title='26840'>Here we are. </span>
<span sid='26841' title='26841'>Whoa, there, whoa!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26842' title='26842'>We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds. </span>
<span sid='26843' title='26843'>A stable-boy had run out to the horse's head, and, springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel drive which led to the house. </span>
<span sid='26844' title='26844'>As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline-de-soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. </span>
<span sid='26845' title='26845'>She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half raised in eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26846' title='26846'>'Well?' she cried, 'well?' </span>
<span sid='26847' title='26847'>And then, seeing that there were two of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26848' title='26848'>'No good news?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26849' title='26849'>'None.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26850' title='26850'>'No bad?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26851' title='26851'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26852' title='26852'>'Thank God for that. </span>
<span sid='26853' title='26853'>But come in. </span>
<span sid='26854' title='26854'>You must be weary, for you have had a long day.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26855' title='26855'>'This is my friend, Dr Watson. </span>
<span sid='26856' title='26856'>He has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26857' title='26857'>'I am delighted to see you,' said she, pressing my hand warmly. </span>
<span sid='26858' title='26858'>'You will, I am sure, forgive anything which may be wanting in our arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26859' title='26859'>'My dear madam,' said I, 'I am an old campaigner, and if I were not, I can very well see that no apology is needed. </span>
<span sid='26860' title='26860'>If I can be of any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed happy.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26861' title='26861'>'Now, Mr Sherlock Holmes,' said the lady as we entered a well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out. </span>
<span sid='26862' title='26862'>'I should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain answer.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26863' title='26863'>'Certainly, madam.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26864' title='26864'>'Do not trouble about my feelings. </span>
<span sid='26865' title='26865'>I am not hysterical, nor given to fainting. </span>
<span sid='26866' title='26866'>I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26867' title='26867'>'Upon what point?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26868' title='26868'>'In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26869' title='26869'>Sherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. </span>
<span sid='26870' title='26870'>'Frankly now!' she repeated, standing upon the rug, and looking keenly down at him, as he leaned back in a basket chair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26871' title='26871'>'Frankly, then, madam, I do not.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26872' title='26872'>'You think that he is dead?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26873' title='26873'>'I do.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26874' title='26874'>'Murdered?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26875' title='26875'>'I don't say that. </span>
<span sid='26876' title='26876'>Perhaps.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26877' title='26877'>'And on what day did he meet his death?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26878' title='26878'>'On Monday.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26879' title='26879'>'Then perhaps, Mr Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is that I have received this letter from him today?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26880' title='26880'>Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanized.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26881' title='26881'>'What!' he roared.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26882' title='26882'>'Yes, today.' </span>
<span sid='26883' title='26883'>She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in the air.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26884' title='26884'>'May I see it?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26885' title='26885'>'Certainly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26886' title='26886'>He snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the table, he drew over the lamp, and examined it intently. </span>
<span sid='26887' title='26887'>I had left my chair, and was gazing at it over his shoulder. </span>
<span sid='26888' title='26888'>The envelope was a very coarse one, and was stamped with the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Gravesend&t=h'>Gravesend</a> post-mark, and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was considerably after midnight.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26889' title='26889'>'Coarse writing!' murmured Holmes. </span>
<span sid='26890' title='26890'>'Surely this is not your husband's writing, madam.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26891' title='26891'>'No, but the enclosure is.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26892' title='26892'>'I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26893' title='26893'>'How can you tell that?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26894' title='26894'>'The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself. </span>
<span sid='26895' title='26895'>The rest is of the greyish colour which shows that blotting-paper has been used. </span>
<span sid='26896' title='26896'>If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. </span>
<span sid='26897' title='26897'>This man has written the name, and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not familiar with it. </span>
<span sid='26898' title='26898'>It is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as trifles. </span>
<span sid='26899' title='26899'>Let us now see the letter! </span>
<span sid='26900' title='26900'>Ha! there has been an enclosure here!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26901' title='26901'>'Yes, there was a ring. </span>
<span sid='26902' title='26902'>His signet ring.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26903' title='26903'>'And you are sure that this is your husband's hand?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26904' title='26904'>'One of his hands.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26905' title='26905'>'One?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26906' title='26906'>'His hand when he wrote hurriedly. </span>
<span sid='26907' title='26907'>It is very unlike his usual writing, and yet I know it well.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26908' title='26908'>' "Dearest, do not be frightened. </span>
<span sid='26909' title='26909'>All will come well. </span>
<span sid='26910' title='26910'>There is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify. </span>
<span sid='26911' title='26911'>Wait in patience. </span>

<span sid='26917' title='26917'>And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who has been chewing tobacco. </span>
<span sid='26918' title='26918'>And you have no doubt that it is your husband's hand, madam?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26919' title='26919'>'None. </span>
<span sid='26920' title='26920'>Neville wrote those words.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26921' title='26921'>'And they were posted to-day at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Gravesend&t=h'>Gravesend</a>. </span>
<span sid='26922' title='26922'>Well, Mrs St Clair, the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is over.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26923' title='26923'>'But he must be alive, Mr Holmes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26924' title='26924'>'Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. </span>
<span sid='26925' title='26925'>The ring, after all, proves nothing. </span>
<span sid='26926' title='26926'>It may have been taken from him.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26927' title='26927'>'No, no; it is, it is, it is his very own writing!'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26928' title='26928'>'Very well. </span>
<span sid='26929' title='26929'>It may, however, have been written on Monday, and only posted to-day.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26930' title='26930'>'That is possible.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26931' title='26931'>'If so, much may have happened between.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26932' title='26932'>'Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='26933' title='26933'>I know that all is well with him. </span>
<span sid='26934' title='26934'>There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if evil came upon him. </span>
<span sid='26935' title='26935'>On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened. </span>
<span sid='26936' title='26936'>Do you think that I would respond to such a trifle, and yet be ignorant of his death?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26937' title='26937'>'I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. </span>
<span sid='26938' title='26938'>And in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view. </span>
<span sid='26939' title='26939'>But if your husband is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away from you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26940' title='26940'>'I cannot imagine. </span>
<span sid='26941' title='26941'>It is unthinkable.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26942' title='26942'>'And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26943' title='26943'>'No.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26944' title='26944'>'And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26945' title='26945'>'Very much so.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26946' title='26946'>'Was the window open?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26947' title='26947'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26948' title='26948'>'Then he might have called to you?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26949' title='26949'>'He might.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26950' title='26950'>'He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26951' title='26951'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26952' title='26952'>'A call for help, you thought?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26953' title='26953'>'Yes. </span>
<span sid='26954' title='26954'>He waved his hands.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26955' title='26955'>'But it might have been a cry of surprise. </span>
<span sid='26956' title='26956'>Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26957' title='26957'>'It is possible.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26958' title='26958'>'And you thought he was pulled back?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26959' title='26959'>'He disappeared so suddenly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26960' title='26960'>'He might have leaped back. </span>
<span sid='26961' title='26961'>You did not see anyone else in the room?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26962' title='26962'>'No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26963' title='26963'>'Quite so. </span>
<span sid='26964' title='26964'>Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26965' title='26965'>'But without his collar or tie. </span>
<span sid='26966' title='26966'>I distinctly saw his bare throat.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26967' title='26967'>'Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26968' title='26968'>'Never.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26969' title='26969'>'Had he ever shown any signs of having taken opium?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26970' title='26970'>'Never.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26971' title='26971'>'Thank you, Mrs St Clair. </span>
<span sid='26972' title='26972'>Those are the principal points about which I wished to be absolutely clear. </span>
<span sid='26973' title='26973'>We shall now have a little supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26974' title='26974'>A large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after my night of adventure. </span>
<span sid='26975' title='26975'>Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view, until he had either fathomed it, or convinced himself that his data were insufficient. </span>
<span sid='26976' title='26976'>It was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. </span>
<span sid='26977' title='26977'>He took off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed, and cusions from the sofa and armchairs. </span>
<span sid='26978' title='26978'>With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an ounce of shag -tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. </span>
<span sid='26979' title='26979'>In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old brier pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. </span>
<span sid='26980' title='26980'>So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment. </span>
<span sid='26981' title='26981'>The pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upwards, and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of, the heap of shag which I had seen upon the previous night.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26982' title='26982'>'Awake, Watson?' he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26983' title='26983'>'Yes.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26984' title='26984'>'Game for a morning drive?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26985' title='26985'>'Certainly.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26986' title='26986'>'Then dress. </span>
<span sid='26987' title='26987'>No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.' </span>
<span sid='26988' title='26988'>He chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26989' title='26989'>As I dressed I glanced at my watch. </span>
<span sid='26990' title='26990'>It was no wonder that no one was stirring. </span>
<span sid='26991' title='26991'>It was twenty-five minutes past four. </span>
<span sid='26992' title='26992'>I had hardly finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26993' title='26993'>'I want to test a little theory of mine,' said he, pulling on his boots. </span>
<span sid='26994' title='26994'>'I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Europe&t=h'>Europe</a>. </span>
<span sid='26995' title='26995'>I deserve to be kicked from here to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Charing Cross&t=h'>Charing Cross</a>. </span>
<span sid='26996' title='26996'>But I think I have the key of the affair now.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='26997' title='26997'>'And where is it?' I asked, smiling.</span>
<p>
<span sid='26998' title='26998'>'In the bath-room,' he answered. </span>
<span sid='26999' title='26999'>'Oh, yes, I am not joking,' he continued, seeing my look of incredulity. </span>
<span sid='27000' title='27000'>'I have just been there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. </span>
<span sid='27001' title='27001'>Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27002' title='27002'>We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible; and out into the bright morning sunshine. </span>
<span sid='27003' title='27003'>In the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. </span>
<span sid='27004' title='27004'>We both sprang in, and away we dashed down the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> road. </span>
<span sid='27005' title='27005'>A few country carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27006' title='27006'>'It has been in some points a singular case,' said Holmes, flicking the horse on into a gallop. </span>
<span sid='27007' title='27007'>'I confess that I have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late, than never to learn it at all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27008' title='27008'>In town, the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Surrey&t=h'>Surrey</a> side. </span>
<span sid='27009' title='27009'>Passing down the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Waterloo Bridge&t=h'>Waterloo Bridge</a> Road we crossed over the river, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right, and found ourselves in Bow Street. </span>
<span sid='27010' title='27010'>Sherlock Holmes was well known to the Force, and the two constables at the door saluted him. </span>
<span sid='27011' title='27011'>One of them held the horse's head while the other led us in.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27012' title='27012'>'Who is on duty?' asked Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27013' title='27013'>'Inspector Bradstreet, sir.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27014' title='27014'>'Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?' </span>
<span sid='27015' title='27015'>A tall, stout official had come down the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. </span>
<span sid='27016' title='27016'>'I wish to have a word with you, Bradstreet.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27017' title='27017'>'Certainly, Mr Holmes. </span>
<span sid='27018' title='27018'>Step into my room here.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27019' title='27019'>It was a small office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a telephone projecting from the wall. </span>
<span sid='27020' title='27020'>The inspector sat down at his desk.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27021' title='27021'>'What can I do for you, Mr Holmes?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27022' title='27022'>'I called about that beggarman, Boone - the, one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr Neville St Clair, of Lee.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27023' title='27023'>'Yes. </span>
<span sid='27024' title='27024'>He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27025' title='27025'>'So I heard. </span>
<span sid='27026' title='27026'>You have him here?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27027' title='27027'>'In the cells.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27028' title='27028'>'Is he quiet?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27029' title='27029'>'Oh, he gives no trouble. </span>
<span sid='27030' title='27030'>But he is a dirty scoundrel.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27031' title='27031'>'Dirty?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27032' title='27032'>'Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as black as a tinker's. </span>
<span sid='27033' title='27033'>Well, when once his case has been settled he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him you would agree with me that he needed it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27034' title='27034'>'I should like to see him very much.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27035' title='27035'>'Would you? </span>
<span sid='27036' title='27036'>That is easily done. </span>
<span sid='27037' title='27037'>Come this way. </span>
<span sid='27038' title='27038'>You can leave your bag.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27039' title='27039'>'No, I think that I'll take it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27040' title='27040'>'Very good. </span>
<span sid='27041' title='27041'>Come this way, if you please.' </span>
<span sid='27042' title='27042'>He led us down a passage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a white-washed corridor with a line of doors on each side.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27043' title='27043'>'The third on the right is his,' said the inspector. </span>
<span sid='27044' title='27044'>'Here it is!' </span>
<span sid='27045' title='27045'>He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door, and glanced through.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27046' title='27046'>'He is asleep,' said he. </span>
<span sid='27047' title='27047'>'You can see him very well.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27048' title='27048'>We both put our eyes to the grating. </span>
<span sid='27049' title='27049'>The prisoner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. </span>
<span sid='27050' title='27050'>He was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. </span>
<span sid='27051' title='27051'>He was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. </span>
<span sid='27052' title='27052'>A broad weal from an old scar ran across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. </span>
<span sid='27053' title='27053'>A shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27054' title='27054'>'He's a beauty, isn't he?' said the inspector.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27055' title='27055'>'He certainly needs a wash,' remarked Holmes. </span>
<span sid='27056' title='27056'>'I had an idea that he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.' </span>
<span sid='27057' title='27057'>He opened his Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very large bath sponge.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27058' title='27058'>'He! he! </span>
<span sid='27059' title='27059'>You are a funny one,' chuckled the inspector.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27060' title='27060'>'Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27061' title='27061'>'Well, I don't know why not,' said the inspector. </span>
<span sid='27062' title='27062'>'He doesn't look a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?' </span>
<span sid='27063' title='27063'>He slipped his key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. </span>
<span sid='27064' title='27064'>The sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. </span>
<span sid='27065' title='27065'>Holmes stooped to the water jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner's face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27066' title='27066'>'Let me introduce you,' he shouted, 'to Mr Neville St Clair, of Lee, in the county of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Kent&t=h'>Kent</a>.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27067' title='27067'>Never in my life have I seen such a sight. </span>
<span sid='27068' title='27068'>The man's face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree. </span>
<span sid='27069' title='27069'>Gone was the coarse brown tint! </span>
<span sid='27070' title='27070'>Gone, too, the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! </span>
<span sid='27071' title='27071'>A twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes, and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment. </span>
<span sid='27072' title='27072'>Then suddenly realizing the exposure, he broke into a scream, and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27073' title='27073'>'Great heaven!' cried the inspector, 'it is, indeed, the missing man. </span>
<span sid='27074' title='27074'>I know him from the photograph.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27075' title='27075'>The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny. </span>
<span sid='27076' title='27076'>'Be it so,' said he. </span>
<span sid='27077' title='27077'>'And pray what am I charged with?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27078' title='27078'>'With making away with Mr Neville St - Oh, come, you can't be charged with that, unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,' said the inspector, with a grin. </span>
<span sid='27079' title='27079'>'Well, I have been twenty-seven years in the Force, but this really takes the cake.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27080' title='27080'>'If I am Mr Neville St Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27081' title='27081'>'No crime, but a very great error has been committed,' said Holmes. </span>
<span sid='27082' title='27082'>'You would have done better to have trusted your wife.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27083' title='27083'>'It was not the wife, it was the children,' groaned the prisoner. </span>
<span sid='27084' title='27084'>'God help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. </span>
<span sid='27085' title='27085'>My God! </span>
<span sid='27086' title='27086'>What an exposure! </span>
<span sid='27087' title='27087'>What can I do?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27088' title='27088'>Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch, and patted him kindly on the shoulder.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27089' title='27089'>'If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,' said he, 'of course you can hardly avoid publicity. </span>
<span sid='27090' title='27090'>On the other hand, if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers. </span>
<span sid='27091' title='27091'>Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you might tell us, and submit it to the proper authorities. </span>
<span sid='27092' title='27092'>The case would then never go into court at all.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27093' title='27093'>'God bless you!' cried the prisoner passionately. </span>
<span sid='27094' title='27094'>'I would have endured imprisonment, aye, even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27095' title='27095'>'You are the first who have ever heard my story. </span>
<span sid='27096' title='27096'>My father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education. </span>
<span sid='27097' title='27097'>I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>. </span>
<span sid='27098' title='27098'>One day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them. </span>
<span sid='27099' title='27099'>There was the point from which all my adventures started. </span>
<span sid='27100' title='27100'>It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to base my articles. </span>
<span sid='27101' title='27101'>When an actor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been famous in the greenroom for my skill. </span>
<span sid='27102' title='27102'>I took advantage now of my attainments. </span>
<span sid='27103' title='27103'>I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. </span>
<span sid='27104' title='27104'>Then with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the busiest part of the City, ostensibly as a match-seller, but really as a beggar. </span>
<span sid='27105' title='27105'>For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the evening I found, to my surprise, that I had received no less than twenty-six shillings and fourpence.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27106' title='27106'>'I wrote my articles, and thought little more of the matter until, some time later, I backed a bill for a friend, and had a writ served upon me for £25. </span>
<span sid='27107' title='27107'>I was at my wits' end where to get the money, but a sudden idea came to me. </span>
<span sid='27108' title='27108'>I begged a fortnight's grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise. </span>
<span sid='27109' title='27109'>In ten days I had the money, and had paid the debt.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27110' title='27110'>'Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at two pounds a week, when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still. </span>
<span sid='27111' title='27111'>It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting, and sat day after day in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face, and filling my pockets with coppers. </span>
<span sid='27112' title='27112'>Only one man knew my secret. </span>
<span sid='27113' title='27113'>He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evening transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. </span>
<span sid='27114' title='27114'>This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that my secret was safe in his possession.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27115' title='27115'>'Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money. </span>
<span sid='27116' title='27116'>I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> could earn seven hundred pounds a year	which is less than my average takings - but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility in repartee, which improved by practice, and made me quite a recognized character in the City. </span>
<span sid='27117' title='27117'>All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day upon which I failed to take two pounds.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27118' title='27118'>'As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country, and eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation. </span>
<span sid='27119' title='27119'>My dear wife knew that I had business in the City. </span>
<span sid='27120' title='27120'>She little knew what.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27121' title='27121'>'Last Monday I had finished for the day, and was dressing in my room above the opium den, when I looked out of the window, and saw, to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. </span>
<span sid='27122' title='27122'>I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. </span>
<span sid='27123' title='27123'>I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. </span>
<span sid='27124' title='27124'>Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. </span>
<span sid='27125' title='27125'>Even a wife's eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. </span>
<span sid='27126' title='27126'>But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room and that the clothes might betray me. </span>
<span sid='27127' title='27127'>I threw open the window, re-opening by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning. </span>
<span sid='27128' title='27128'>Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings. </span>
<span sid='27129' title='27129'>I hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the Thames. </span>
<span sid='27130' title='27130'>The other clothes would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr Neville St Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27131' title='27131'>'I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. </span>
<span sid='27132' title='27132'>I was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference for a dirty face. </span>
<span sid='27133' title='27133'>Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring, and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27134' title='27134'>'That note only reached her yesterday,' said Holmes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='27135' title='27135'>'Good God! </span>
<span sid='27136' title='27136'>What a week she must have spent.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27137' title='27137'>'The police have watched this Lascar,' said Inspector Bradstreet, 'and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved. </span>
<span sid='27138' title='27138'>Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27139' title='27139'>'That was it,' said Holmes, nodding approvingly, 'I have no doubt of it. </span>
<span sid='27140' title='27140'>But have you never been prosecuted for begging?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27141' title='27141'>'Many times; but what was a fine to me?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27142' title='27142'>'It must stop here, however,' said Bradstreet. </span>
<span sid='27143' title='27143'>'If the police are to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27144' title='27144'>'I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27145' title='27145'>'In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken. </span>
<span sid='27146' title='27146'>But if you are found again, then all must come out. </span>
<span sid='27147' title='27147'>I am sure, Mr Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up. </span>
<span sid='27148' title='27148'>I wish I knew how you reach your results.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='27149' title='27149'>'I reached this one,' said my friend, 'by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag. </span>
<span sid='27150' title='27150'>I think, Watson, that if we drive to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Baker Street&t=h'>Baker Street</a> we shall just be in time for breakfast.'</span>
