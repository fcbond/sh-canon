<p class="subtitle">Arthur Conan Doyle<label for="sn-meta-glor" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-meta-glor" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><!--googleoff: all--><b>Story Number</b>: 19<br><b>Published in</b>: The Strand Magazine in April 1893<br><b>Collected in</b>: The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes<!--googleon: all--></span></p>
<p>
<span sid='36113' title='36113'>'I have some papers here,' said my friend, Sherlock Holmes, as we sat one winter's night on either side of the fire, 'which I really think, Watson, it would be worth your while to glance over. </span>
<span sid='36114' title='36114'>These are the documents in the extraordinary case of the Gloria Scott, and this is the message which struck Justice of the Peace Trevor dead with horror when he read it.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36115' title='36115'>He had picked from a drawer a little tarnished cylinder, and, undoing the tape, he handed me a short note scrawled upon a half sheet of slate-grey paper.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36116' title='36116'>'The supply of game for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> is going steadily up,' it ran. </span>
<span sid='36117' title='36117'>'Head-keeper Hudson, we believe, has been now told to receive all orders for fly paper, and for preservation of your hen pheasant's life.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36118' title='36118'>As I glanced up from reading this enigmatical message I saw Holmes chuckling at the expression upon my face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36119' title='36119'>'You look a little bewildered,' said he.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36120' title='36120'>'I cannot see how such a message as this could inspire horror. </span>
<span sid='36121' title='36121'>It seems to me to be rather grotesque than otherwise.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36122' title='36122'>'Very likely. </span>
<span sid='36123' title='36123'>Yet the fact remains that the reader, who was a fine, robust old man, was knocked clean down by it, as if it had been the butt-end of a pistol.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36124' title='36124'>'You arouse my curiosity,' said I. </span>
<span sid='36125' title='36125'>'But why did you say just now that there were very particular reasons why I should study this case?'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36126' title='36126'>'Because it was the first in which I was ever engaged.'</span>
<p>
<span sid='36127' title='36127'>I had often endeavoured to elicit from my companion what had first turned his mind in the direction of criminal research, but I had never caught him before in a communicative humour. </span>
<span sid='36128' title='36128'>Now he sat forward in his arm-chair, and spread out the documents upon his knees. </span>
<span sid='36129' title='36129'>Then he lit his pipe and sat for some time smoking and turning them over.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36130' title='36130'>'You never heard me talk of Victor Trevor?' he asked. </span>
<span sid='36131' title='36131'>'He was the only friend I made during the two years that I was at college. </span>
<span sid='36132' title='36132'>I was never a very sociable fellow, Watson, always rather fond of moping in my rooms and working out my own little methods of thought, so that I never mixed much with the men of my year. </span>
<span sid='36133' title='36133'>Bar fencing and boxing I had few athletic tastes, and then my line of study was quite distinct from that of the other fellows, so that we had no points of contact at all. </span>
<span sid='36134' title='36134'>Trevor was the only man I knew, and that only through the accident of his bull-terrier freezing on to my ankle one morning as I went down to chapel.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36135' title='36135'>'It was a prosaic way of forming a friendship, but it was effective. </span>
<span sid='36136' title='36136'>I was laid by the heels for ten days, and Trevor used to come in to inquire after me. </span>
<span sid='36137' title='36137'>At first it was only a minute's chat, but soon his visits lengthened, and before the end of the term we were close friends. </span>
<span sid='36138' title='36138'>He was a hearty, full-blooded fellow, full of spirit and energy, the very opposite to me in most respects, but we found we had some subjects in common, and it was a bond of union when I learned that he was as friendless as I. </span>
<span sid='36139' title='36139'>Finally, he invited me down to his father's place at Donnithorpe, in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norfolk&t=h'>Norfolk</a>, and I accepted his hospitality for a month of the long vacation.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36140' title='36140'>'Old Trevor was evidently a man of some wealth and consideration, a J.P. and a landed proprietor. </span>
<span sid='36141' title='36141'>Donnithorpe is a little hamlet just to the north of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Langmere&t=h'>Langmere</a>, in the country of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Broads&t=h'>the Broads</a>. </span>
<span sid='36142' title='36142'>The house was an old-fashioned, wide-spread, oak-beamed, brick building, with a fine lime-lined avenue leading up to it. </span>
<span sid='36143' title='36143'>There was excellent wild duck shooting in the fens, remarkably good fishing, a small but select library, taken over, as I understood, from a former occupant, and a tolerable cook, so that it would be a fastidious man who could not put in a pleasant month there.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36144' title='36144'>'Trevor senior was a widower, and my friend was his only son. </span>
<span sid='36145' title='36145'>There had been a daughter, I heard, but she had died of diphtheria while on a visit to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Birmingham&t=h'>Birmingham</a>. </span>
<span sid='36146' title='36146'>The father interested me extremely. </span>
<span sid='36147' title='36147'>He was a man of little culture, but with a considerable amount of rude strength both physically and mentally. </span>
<span sid='36148' title='36148'>He knew hardly any books, but he had travelled far, had seen much of the world, and had remembered all that he had learned. </span>
<span sid='36149' title='36149'>In person he was a thick-set, burly man with a shock of grizzled hair, a brown, weatherbeaten face, and blue eyes which were keen to the verge of fierceness. </span>
<span sid='36150' title='36150'>Yet he had a reputation for kindness and charity in the countryside, and was noted for the leniency of his sentences from the bench.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36151' title='36151'>'One evening, shortly after my arrival, we were sitting over a glass of port after dinner, when young Trevor began to talk about those habits of observation and inference which I had already formed into a system, although I had not yet appreciated the part which they were to play in my life. </span>
<span sid='36152' title='36152'>The old man evidently thought that his son was exaggerating in his description of one or two trivial feats which I had performed.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36153' title='36153'>'"Come now, Mr Holmes," said he, laughing good-humouredly, "I'm an excellent subject, if you can deduce anything from me."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36154' title='36154'>'I fear there is not very much," I answered. </span>
<span sid='36155' title='36155'>"I might suggest that you have gone about in fear of some personal attack within the last twelve months."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36156' title='36156'>'The laugh faded from his lips, and he stared at me in great surprise.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36157' title='36157'>'"Well, that's true enough," said he. </span>
<span sid='36158' title='36158'>"You know, Victor," turning to his son, "when we broke up that poaching gang, they swore to knife us, and Sir Edward Hoby has actually been attacked. </span>
<span sid='36159' title='36159'>I've always been on my guard since then, though I have no idea how you know it."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36160' title='36160'>'"You have a very handsome stick," I answered. </span>
<span sid='36161' title='36161'>"By the inscription, I observed that you had not had it more than a year. </span>
<span sid='36162' title='36162'>But you have taken some pains to bore the head of it and pour melted lead into the hole, so as to make it a formidable weapon. </span>
<span sid='36163' title='36163'>I argued that you would not take such precautions unless you had some danger to fear."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36164' title='36164'>'"Right again. </span>
<span sid='36165' title='36165'>How did you know it? </span>
<span sid='36166' title='36166'>Is my nose knocked a little out of the straight?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='36167' title='36167'>'"No," said I, "It is your ears. </span>
<span sid='36168' title='36168'>They have the peculiar flattening and thickening which marks the boxing man."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36169' title='36169'>'"Anything else?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='36170' title='36170'>'"You have done a great deal of digging, by your callosities."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36171' title='36171'>'"Made all my money at the gold-fields."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36172' title='36172'>'"You have been in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=New Zealand&t=h'>New Zealand</a>."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36173' title='36173'>'"Right again."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36174' title='36174'>'"You have visited <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Japan&t=h'>Japan</a>."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36175' title='36175'>'"Quite true."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36176' title='36176'>'"And you have been most intimately associated with someone whose initials were J.A., and whom you afterwards were eager to entirely forget."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36177' title='36177'>'Mr Trevor stood slowly up, fixed his large blue eyes on me with a strange, wild stare, and then pitched forward on his face among the nutshells which strewed the cloth, in a dead faint.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36178' title='36178'>'You can imagine, Watson, how shocked both his son and I were. </span>
<span sid='36179' title='36179'>His attack did not last long, however, for when we undid his collar and sprinkled the water from one of the finger glasses over his face, he gave a gasp or two and sat up.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36180' title='36180'>'"Ah, boys!" said he, forcing a smile. </span>
<span sid='36181' title='36181'>"I hope I haven't frightened you. </span>
<span sid='36182' title='36182'>Strong as I look, there is a weak place in my heart, and it does not take much to knock me over. </span>
<span sid='36183' title='36183'>I don't know how you manage this, Mr Holmes, but it seems to me that all the detectives of fact and of fancy would be children in your hands. </span>
<span sid='36184' title='36184'>That's your line of life, sir, and you may take the word of a man who has seen something of the world."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36185' title='36185'>'And that recommendation, with the exaggerated estimate of my ability with which he prefaced it, was, if you will believe me, Watson, the very first thing which ever made me feel that a profession might be made out of what had up to that time been the merest hobby. </span>
<span sid='36186' title='36186'>At the moment, however, I was too much concerned at the sudden illness of my host to think of anything else.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36187' title='36187'>'"I hope that I have said nothing to pain you," said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36188' title='36188'>'"Well, you certainly touched upon rather a tender point. </span>
<span sid='36189' title='36189'>Might I ask how you know and how much you know?" </span>
<span sid='36190' title='36190'>He spoke now in a half jesting fashion, but a look of terror still lurked at the back of his eyes.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36191' title='36191'>'"It is simplicity itself," said I. </span>
<span sid='36192' title='36192'>'When you bared your arm to draw that fish into the boat, I saw that J. A. had been tattooed in the bend of the elbow. </span>
<span sid='36193' title='36193'>The letters were still legible, but it was perfectly clear from their blurred appearance, and from the staining of the skin round them, that efforts had been made to obliterate them. </span>
<span sid='36194' title='36194'>It was obvious, then, that those initials had once been very familiar to you, and that you had afterwards wished to forget them."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36195' title='36195'>'"What an eye you have!" he cried, with a sigh of relief. </span>
<span sid='36196' title='36196'>"It is just as you say. </span>
<span sid='36197' title='36197'>But we won't talk of it. </span>
<span sid='36198' title='36198'>Of all ghosts, the ghosts of our old loves are the worst. </span>
<span sid='36199' title='36199'>Come into the billiard-room and have a quiet cigar."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36200' title='36200'>'From that day, amid all his cordiality, there was always a touch of suspicion in Mr Trevor's manner towards me. </span>
<span sid='36201' title='36201'>Even his son remarked it. </span>
<span sid='36202' title='36202'>"You've given the governor such a turn," said he, "that he'll never be sure again of what you know and what you don't know." </span>
<span sid='36203' title='36203'>He did not mean to show it, I am sure, but it was so strongly in his mind that it peeped out at every action. </span>
<span sid='36204' title='36204'>At last I became so convinced that I was causing him uneasiness, that I drew my visit to a close. </span>
<span sid='36205' title='36205'>On the very day, however, before I left, an incident occurred which proved in the sequel to be of importance.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36206' title='36206'>'We were sitting out upon the lawn on garden chairs, the three of us, basking in the sun and admiring the view across <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the Broads&t=h'>the Broads</a>, when the maid came out to say that there was a man at the door who wanted to see Mr Trevor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36207' title='36207'>'"What is his name?" asked my host.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36208' title='36208'>'"He would not give any."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36209' title='36209'>'"What does he want, then?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='36210' title='36210'>'"He says that you know him, and that he only wants a moment's conversation."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36211' title='36211'>'"Show him round here." </span>
<span sid='36212' title='36212'>An instant afterwards there appeared a little wizened fellow, with a cringing manner and a shambling style of walking. </span>
<span sid='36213' title='36213'>He wore an open jacket, with a splotch of tar on the sleeve, a red and black check shirt, dungaree trousers, and heavy boots badly worn. </span>
<span sid='36214' title='36214'>His face was thin and brown and crafty, with a perpetual smile upon it, which showed an irregular line of yellow teeth, and his crinkled hands were half-closed in a way that is distinctive of sailors. </span>
<span sid='36215' title='36215'>As he came slouching across the lawn I heard Mr Trevor make a sort of hiccoughing noise in his throat, and, jumping out of his chair, he ran into the house. </span>
<span sid='36216' title='36216'>He was back in a moment, and I smelt a strong reek of brandy as he passed me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36217' title='36217'>'"Well, my man," said he, "what can I do for you?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='36218' title='36218'>'The sailor stood looking at him with puckered eyes, and with the same loose-lipped smile upon his face.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36219' title='36219'>'"You don't know me?" he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36220' title='36220'>'"Why, dear me, it is surely Hudson!" said Mr Trevor, in a tone of surprise.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36221' title='36221'>'"Hudson it is, sir," said the seaman. </span>
<span sid='36222' title='36222'>"Why, it's thirty year and more since I saw you last. </span>
<span sid='36223' title='36223'>Here you are in your house, and me still picking my salt meat out of the harness cask."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36224' title='36224'>'"Tut, you will find that I have not forgotten old times," cried Mr Trevor, and, walking towards the sailor, he said something in a low voice. </span>
<span sid='36225' title='36225'>"Go into the kitchen," he continued out loud, "and you will get food and drink. </span>
<span sid='36226' title='36226'>I have no doubt that I shall find you a situation."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36227' title='36227'>'"Thank you, sir," said the seaman, touching his forelock. </span>
<span sid='36228' title='36228'>"I'm just off a two-yearer in an eight-knot tramp, shorthanded at that, and I wants a rest. </span>
<span sid='36229' title='36229'>I thought I'd get it either with Mr Beddoes or with you."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36230' title='36230'>'"Ah!" cried Mr Trevor, "you know where Mr Beddoes is?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='36231' title='36231'>'"Bless you, sir, I know where all my old friends are," said the fellow, with a sinister smile, and slouched off after the maid to the kitchen. </span>
<span sid='36232' title='36232'>Mr Trevor mumbled something to us about having been shipmates with the man when he was going back to the diggings, and then, leaving us on the lawn, he went indoors. </span>
<span sid='36233' title='36233'>An hour later, when we entered the house we found him stretched dead drunk upon the dining-room sofa. </span>
<span sid='36234' title='36234'>The whole incident left a most ugly impression upon my mind, and I was not sorry next day to leave Donnithorpe behind me, for I felt that my presence must be a source of embarrassment to my friend.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36235' title='36235'>'All this occurred during the first month of the long vacation. </span>
<span sid='36236' title='36236'>I went up to my <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> rooms, where I spent seven weeks working out a few experiments in organic chemistry. </span>
<span sid='36237' title='36237'>One day, however, when the autumn was far advanced and the vacation drawing to a close, I received a telegram from my friend imploring me to return to Donnithorpe, and saying that he was in great need of my advice and assistance. </span>
<span sid='36238' title='36238'>Of course I dropped everything and set out for the north once more.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36239' title='36239'>'He met me with the dog-cart at the station, and I saw at a glance that the last two months had been very trying ones for him. </span>
<span sid='36240' title='36240'>He had grown thin and careworn, and had lost the loud, cheery manner for which he had been remarkable.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36241' title='36241'>'"The governor is dying," were the first words he said.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36242' title='36242'>'"Impossible!" I cried. </span>
<span sid='36243' title='36243'>"What is the matter?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='36244' title='36244'>'"Apoplexy. </span>
<span sid='36245' title='36245'>Nervous shock. </span>
<span sid='36246' title='36246'>He's been on the verge all day. </span>
<span sid='36247' title='36247'>I doubt if we shall find him alive."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36248' title='36248'>'I was, as you may think, Watson, horrified at this unexpected news.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36249' title='36249'>'"What has caused it?" I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36250' title='36250'>'"Ah, that is the point. </span>
<span sid='36251' title='36251'>Jump in, and we can talk it over while we drive. </span>
<span sid='36252' title='36252'>You remember that fellow who came upon the evening before you left us?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='36253' title='36253'>'"Perfectly."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36254' title='36254'>'"Do you know who it was that we let into the house that day?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='36255' title='36255'>'"I have no idea."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36256' title='36256'>'"It was the Devil, Holmes!" he cried.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36257' title='36257'>'I stared at him in astonishment.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36258' title='36258'>'"Yes, it was the Devil himself. </span>
<span sid='36259' title='36259'>We have not had a peaceful hour since - not one. </span>
<span sid='36260' title='36260'>The governor has never held up his head from that evening, and now the life has been crushed out of him, and his heart broken, all through this accursed Hudson."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36261' title='36261'>'"What power had he, then?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='36262' title='36262'>'"Ah, that is what I would give so much to know. </span>
<span sid='36263' title='36263'>The kindly, charitable, good old governor! </span>
<span sid='36264' title='36264'>How could he have fallen into the clutches of such a ruffian? </span>
<span sid='36265' title='36265'>But I am so glad that you have come, Holmes. </span>
<span sid='36266' title='36266'>I trust very much to your judgment and discretion, and I know that you will advise me for the best."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36267' title='36267'>'We were dashing along the smooth, white country road, with the long stretch of Broads in front of us glimmering in the red light of the setting sun. </span>
<span sid='36268' title='36268'>From a grove upon our left I could already see the high chimneys and the flag-staff which marked the squire's dwelling.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36269' title='36269'>'"My father made the fellow gardener," said my companion, "and then, as that did not satisfy him, he was promoted to be butler. </span>
<span sid='36270' title='36270'>The house seemed to be at his mercy, and he wandered about and did what he chose in it. </span>
<span sid='36271' title='36271'>The maids complained of his drunken habits and his vile language. </span>
<span sid='36272' title='36272'>The dad raised their wages all round to recompense them for the annoyance. </span>
<span sid='36273' title='36273'>The fellow would take the boat and my father's best gun and treat himself to little shooting parties. </span>
<span sid='36274' title='36274'>And all this with such a sneering, leering, insolent face, that I would have knocked him down twenty times over if he had been a man of my own age. </span>
<span sid='36275' title='36275'>I tell you, Holmes, I have had to keep a tight hold upon myself all this time, and now I am asking myself whether, if I had let myself go a little more, I might not have been a wiser man.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36276' title='36276'>'"Well, matters went from bad to worse with us, and this animal, Hudson, became more and more intrusive, until at last, on his making some insolent reply to my father in my presence one day, I took him by the shoulder and turned him out of the room. </span>
<span sid='36277' title='36277'>He slunk away with a livid face, and two venomous eyes which uttered more threats than his tongue could do. </span>
<span sid='36278' title='36278'>I don't know what passed between the poor dad and him after that, but the dad came to me next day and asked me whether I would mind apologizing to Hudson. </span>
<span sid='36279' title='36279'>I refused, as you can imagine, and asked my father how he could allow such a wretch to take such liberties with himself and, his household.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36280' title='36280'>'"Ah, my boy," said he, "it is all very well to talk, but you don't know how I am placed. </span>
<span sid='36281' title='36281'>But you shall know, Victor. </span>
<span sid='36282' title='36282'>I'll see that you shall know, come what may! </span>
<span sid='36283' title='36283'>You wouldn't believe harm of your poor old father, would you, lad?" </span>
<span sid='36284' title='36284'>He was very much moved, and shut himself up in the study all day, where I could see through the window that he was writing busily.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36285' title='36285'>'"That evening there came what seemed to me to be a grand release, for Hudson told us that he was going to leave us. </span>
<span sid='36286' title='36286'>He walked into the dining-room as we sat after dinner and announced his intention in the thick voice of a half-drunken man.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36287' title='36287'>'"I've had enough of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Norfolk&t=h'>Norfolk</a>," said he, "I'll run down to Mr Beddoes, in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Hampshire&t=h'>Hampshire</a>. </span>
<span sid='36288' title='36288'>He'll be as glad to see me as you were, I dare say."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36289' title='36289'>'"You're not going away in an unkind spirit, Hudson, I hope?" said my father, with a tameness which made my blood boil.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36290' title='36290'>'"I've not had my 'pology," said he, sulkily, glancing in my direction.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36291' title='36291'>'"Victor, you will acknowledge that you have used this worthy fellow rather roughly?" said the dad, turning to me.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36292' title='36292'>'"On the contrary, I think that we have both shown extraordinary patience towards him," I answered.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36293' title='36293'>'"Oh, you do, do you?" he snarled. </span>
<span sid='36294' title='36294'>"Very good, mate. </span>
<span sid='36295' title='36295'>We'll see about that!" </span>
<span sid='36296' title='36296'>He slouched out of the room, and half an hour afterwards left the house, leaving my father in a state of pitiable nervousness. </span>
<span sid='36297' title='36297'>Night after night I heard him pacing his room, and it was just as he was recovering his confidence that the blow did at last fall.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36298' title='36298'>'"And how?" I asked eagerly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36299' title='36299'>'"In a most extraordinary fashion. </span>
<span sid='36300' title='36300'>A letter arrived for my father yesterday evening, bearing the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Fordingbridge&t=h'>Fordingbridge</a> postmark. </span>
<span sid='36301' title='36301'>My father read it, clapped both his hands to his head, and began running round the room in little circles like a man who has been driven out of his senses. </span>
<span sid='36302' title='36302'>When I at last drew him down on to the sofa, his mouth and eyelids were all puckered on one side, and I saw that he had a stroke. </span>
<span sid='36303' title='36303'>Dr Fordham came over at once, and we put him to bed, but the paralysis has spread, he has shown no sign of returning consciousness, and I think that we shall hardly find him alive."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36304' title='36304'>'"You horrify me, Trevor!" I cried. </span>
<span sid='36305' title='36305'>"What, then, could have been in this letter to cause so dreadful a result?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='36306' title='36306'>'"Nothing. </span>
<span sid='36307' title='36307'>There lies the inexplicable part of it. </span>
<span sid='36308' title='36308'>The message was absurd and trivial. </span>
<span sid='36309' title='36309'>Ah, my God, it is as I feared!"</span>
<p>
<span sid='36310' title='36310'>'As he spoke we came round the curve of the avenue, and saw in the fading light that every blind in the house had been drawn down. </span>
<span sid='36311' title='36311'>As we dashed up to the door, my friend's face convulsed with grief, a gentleman in black emerged from it.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36312' title='36312'>'"When did it happen, doctor?" asked Trevor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36313' title='36313'>'"Almost immediately after you left."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36314' title='36314'>'"Did he recover consciousness?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='36315' title='36315'>'"For an instant before the end."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36316' title='36316'>'"Any message for me?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='36317' title='36317'>'"Only that the papers were in the back drawer of the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Japan&t=h'>Japan</a>ese cabinet."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36318' title='36318'>'My friend ascended with the doctor to the chamber of death, while I remained in the study, turning the whole matter over and over in my head, and feeling as sombre as ever I had done in my life. </span>
<span sid='36319' title='36319'>What was the past of this Trevor: pugilist, traveller, and gold-digger, and how had he placed himself in the power of this acid-faced seaman? </span>
<span sid='36320' title='36320'>Why, too, should he faint at an allusion to the half-effaced initials upon his arm, and die of fright when he had a letter from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Fordingbridge&t=h'>Fordingbridge</a>? </span>
<span sid='36321' title='36321'>Then I remembered that <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Fordingbridge&t=h'>Fordingbridge</a> was in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Hampshire&t=h'>Hampshire</a>, and that this Mr Beddoes, whom the seaman had gone to visit, and presumably to blackmail, had also been mentioned as living in <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Hampshire&t=h'>Hampshire</a>. </span>
<span sid='36322' title='36322'>The letter, then, might either come from Hudson, the seaman, saying that he had betrayed the guilty secret which appeared to exist, or it might come from Beddoes, warning an old confederate that such a betrayal was imminent. </span>
<span sid='36323' title='36323'>So far it seemed clear enough. </span>
<span sid='36324' title='36324'>But, then, how could the letter be trivial and grotesque as described by the son? </span>
<span sid='36325' title='36325'>He must have misread it. </span>
<span sid='36326' title='36326'>If so, it must have been one of those ingenious secret codes which mean one thing while they seem to mean another. </span>
<span sid='36327' title='36327'>I must see this letter. </span>
<span sid='36328' title='36328'>If there were a hidden meaning in it, I was confident that I could pluck it forth. </span>
<span sid='36329' title='36329'>For an hour I sat pondering over it in the gloom, until at last a weeping maid brought in a lamp, and close at her heels came my friend Trevor, pale but composed, with these very papers, which lie upon my knee, held in his grasp. </span>
<span sid='36330' title='36330'>He sat down opposite to me, drew the lamp to the edge of the table, and handed me a short note scribbled, as you see, upon a single sheet of grey paper. </span>
<span sid='36331' title='36331'>"The supply of game for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> is going steadily up," it ran. </span>
<span sid='36332' title='36332'>"Head-keeper Hudson, we believe, has been now told to receive all orders for fly paper and for preservation of your hen pheasant's life."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36333' title='36333'>'I dare say my face looked as bewildered as yours did just now when first I read this message. </span>
<span sid='36334' title='36334'>Then I re-read it very carefully. </span>
<span sid='36335' title='36335'>It was evidently as I had thought, and some second meaning must be buried in this strange combination of words. </span>
<span sid='36336' title='36336'>Or could it be that there was a prearranged significance to such phrases as "fly paper" and "hen pheasant"? </span>
<span sid='36337' title='36337'>Such a meaning would be arbitrary, and could not be deduced in any way. </span>
<span sid='36338' title='36338'>And yet I was loth to believe that this was the case, and the presence of the word "Hudson" seemed to show that the subject of the message was as I had guessed, and that it was from Beddoes rather than the sailor. </span>
<span sid='36339' title='36339'>I tried it backwards, but the combination, "Life pheasant's hen," was not encouraging. </span>
<span sid='36340' title='36340'>Then I tried alternate words, but neither "The of for" nor "supply game <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a>" promised to throw any light upon it. </span>
<span sid='36341' title='36341'>And then in an instant the key of the riddle was in my hands, and I saw that every third word beginning with the first would give a message which might well drive old Trevor to despair.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36342' title='36342'>'It was short and terse, the warning, as I now read it to my companion:</span>
<p>
<span sid='36343' title='36343'>'"The game is up. </span>
<span sid='36344' title='36344'>Hudson has told all. </span>
<span sid='36345' title='36345'>Fly for your life."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36346' title='36346'>'Victor Trevor sank his face into his shaking hands. </span>
<span sid='36347' title='36347'>"It must be that, I suppose," said he. </span>
<span sid='36348' title='36348'>"This is worse than death, for it means disgrace as well. </span>
<span sid='36349' title='36349'>But what is the meaning of these 'head-keepers' and 'hen-pheasants'?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='36350' title='36350'>'"It means nothing to the message, but it might mean a good deal to us if we had no other means of discovering the sender. </span>
<span sid='36351' title='36351'>You see that he has begun by writing, 'The . . . game . . . is,' and so on. </span>
<span sid='36352' title='36352'>Afterwards he had, to fulfil the prearranged cipher, to fill in any two words in each space. </span>
<span sid='36353' title='36353'>He would naturally use the first words which came to his mind, and if there were so many which referred to sport among them, you may be tolerably sure that he is either an ardent shot or interested in breeding. </span>
<span sid='36354' title='36354'>Do you know anything of this Beddoes?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='36355' title='36355'>'"Why, now that you mention it," said he, "I remember that my poor father used to have an invitation from him to shoot over his preserves every autumn."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36356' title='36356'>'"Then it is undoubtedly from him that the note comes," said I. </span>
<span sid='36357' title='36357'>"It only remains for us to find out what this secret was which the sailor Hudson seems to have held over the heads of these two wealthy and respected men."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36358' title='36358'>'"Alas, Holmes, I fear that it is one of sin and shame!" cried my friend. </span>
<span sid='36359' title='36359'>"But from you I shall have no secrets. </span>
<span sid='36360' title='36360'>Here is the statement which was drawn up by my father when he knew that the danger from Hudson had become imminent. </span>
<span sid='36361' title='36361'>I found it in the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Japan&t=h'>Japan</a>ese cabinet, as he told the doctor. </span>
<span sid='36362' title='36362'>Take it and read it to me, for I have neither the strength nor the courage to do it myself."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36363' title='36363'>'These are the very papers, Watson, which he handed to me, and I will read them to you as I read them in the old study that night to him. </span>
<span sid='36364' title='36364'>They are indorsed outside, as you see: "Some particulars of the voyage of the barque Gloria Scott, from her leaving <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Falmouth&t=h'>Falmouth</a> on the 8th October, 1855, to her destruction in N. lat. 15° 20', W. long. 25° 14', on November 6th." </span>
<span sid='36365' title='36365'>It is in the form of a letter, and runs in this way:</span>
<p>
<span sid='36366' title='36366'>'My dear, dear son, - Now that approaching disgrace begins to darken the closing years of my life, I can write with all truth and honesty that it is not the terror of the law, it is not the loss of my position in the county, nor is it my fall in the eyes of all who have known me, which cuts me to the heart, but it is the thought that you should come to blush for me - you who love me, and who have seldom, I hope, had reason to do other than respect me. </span>
<span sid='36367' title='36367'>But if the blow falls which is for ever hanging over me, then I should wish you to read this that you may know straight from me how far I have been to blame. </span>
<span sid='36368' title='36368'>On the other hand, if all should go well (which may kind God Almighty grant!), then if by any chance this paper should be still undestroyed, and should fall into your hands, I conjure you by all you hold sacred, by the memory of your dear mother, and by the love which has been between us, to hurl it into the fire, and to never give one thought to it again.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36369' title='36369'>'If, then, your eye goes on to read this line, I know that I shall already have been exposed and dragged from my home, or, as is more likely - for you know that my heart is weak - be lying with my tongue sealed for ever in death. </span>
<span sid='36370' title='36370'>In either case the time for suppression is past, and every word which I tell you is the naked truth, and this I swear as I hope for mercy.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36371' title='36371'>'My name, dear lad, is not Trevor. </span>
<span sid='36372' title='36372'>I was James Armitage in my younger days, and you can understand now the shock that it was to me a few weeks ago when your college friend addressed me in words which seemed to imply that he had surmised my secret. </span>
<span sid='36373' title='36373'>As Armitage it was that I entered a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> banking house, and as Armitage I was convicted of breaking my country's laws, and was sentenced to transportation. </span>
<span sid='36374' title='36374'>Do not think very harshly of me, laddie. </span>
<span sid='36375' title='36375'>It was a debt of honour, so-called, which I had to pay, and I used money which was not my own to do it, in the certainty that I could replace it before there could be any possibility of its being missed. </span>
<span sid='36376' title='36376'>But the most dreadful ill-luck pursued me. </span>
<span sid='36377' title='36377'>The money which I had reckoned upon never came to hand, and a premature examination of accounts exposed my deficit. </span>
<span sid='36378' title='36378'>The case might have been dealt leniently with, but the laws were more harshly administered thirty years ago than now, and on my twenty-third birthday I found myself chained as a felon with thirty-seven other convicts in the 'tween decks of the barque Gloria Scott, bound for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Australia&t=h'>Australia</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36379' title='36379'>'It was the year '55, when the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Crimea&t=h'>Crimea</a>n War was at its height, and the old convict ships had been largely used as transports in the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Black Sea&t=h'>Black Sea</a>. </span>
<span sid='36380' title='36380'>The Government was compelled therefore to use smaller and less suitable vessels for sending out their prisoners. </span>
<span sid='36381' title='36381'>The Gloria Scott had been in the Chinese tea trade, but she was an old-fashioned, heavy-bowed, broad-beamed craft, and the new clippers had cut her out. </span>
<span sid='36382' title='36382'>She was a 500-ton boat, and besides her thirty-eight jail-birds, she carried twenty-six of a crew, eighteen soldiers, a captain, three mates, a doctor, a chaplain, and four warders. </span>
<span sid='36383' title='36383'>Nearly a hundred souls were in her, all told, when we set sail from <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Falmouth&t=h'>Falmouth</a>.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36384' title='36384'>'The partitions between the cells of the convicts, instead of being of thick oak, as is usual in convict ships, were quite thin and frail. </span>
<span sid='36385' title='36385'>The man next to me upon the aft side was one whom I had particularly noticed when we were led down to the quay. </span>
<span sid='36386' title='36386'>He was a young man with a clear, hairless face, a long thin nose, and rather nutcracker jaws. </span>
<span sid='36387' title='36387'>He carried his head very jauntily in the air, had a swaggering style of walking, and was above all else remarkable for his extraordinary height. </span>
<span sid='36388' title='36388'>I don't think any of our heads would come up to his shoulder, and I am sure that he could not have measured less than six and a half feet. </span>
<span sid='36389' title='36389'>It was strange among so many sad and weary faces to see one which was full of energy and resolution. </span>
<span sid='36390' title='36390'>The sight of it was to me like a fire in a snowstorm. </span>
<span sid='36391' title='36391'>I was glad then to find that he was my neighbour, and gladder still when, in the dead of the night, I heard a whisper close to my ear, and found that he had managed to cut an opening in the board which separated us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36392' title='36392'>'"Hullo, chummy!" said he, "what's your name, and what are you here for?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='36393' title='36393'>'I answered him, and asked in turn who I was talking with.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36394' title='36394'>'"I'm Jack Prendergast," said he, "and, by God, you'll learn to bless my name before you've done with me!"</span>
<p>
<span sid='36395' title='36395'>'I remembered hearing of his case, for it was one which had made an immense sensation throughout the country, some time before my own arrest. </span>
<span sid='36396' title='36396'>He was a man of good family and of great ability, but of incurably vicious habits, who had, by an ingenious system of fraud, obtained huge sums of money from the leading <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=London&t=h'>London</a> merchants.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36397' title='36397'>'"Ah, ah! </span>
<span sid='36398' title='36398'>You remember my case?" said he, proudly.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36399' title='36399'>'"Very well indeed."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36400' title='36400'>'"Then maybe you remember something queer about it?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='36401' title='36401'>'"What was that, then?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='36402' title='36402'>'"I had nearly a quarter of a million, hadn't I?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='36403' title='36403'>'"So it was said."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36404' title='36404'>'"But none was recovered, eh?"</span>
<p>
<span sid='36405' title='36405'>'"No."</span>
<span sid='36406' title='36406'>'"Well, where d'ye suppose the balance is?" he asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36407' title='36407'>'"I have no idea," said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36408' title='36408'>'"Right between my finger and thumb," he cried. </span>
<span sid='36409' title='36409'>"By God, I've got more pounds to my name than you have hairs on your head. </span>
<span sid='36410' title='36410'>And if you've money, my son, and know how to handle it and spread it, you can do anything! </span>
<span sid='36411' title='36411'>Now, you don't think it likely that a man who could do anything is going to wear his breeches out sitting in the stinking hold of a rat-gutted, beetle-ridden, mouldy old coffin of a <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=China&t=h'>China</a> coaster? </span>
<span sid='36412' title='36412'>No, sir, such a man will look after himself, and will look after his chums. </span>
<span sid='36413' title='36413'>You may lay to that! </span>
<span sid='36414' title='36414'>You hold on to him, and you may kiss the Book that he'll haul you through."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36415' title='36415'>'That was his style of talk, and at first I thought it meant nothing, but after a while, when he had tested me and sworn me in with all possible solemnity, he let me understand that there really was a plot to gain command of the vessel. </span>
<span sid='36416' title='36416'>A dozen of the prisoners had hatched it before they came aboard, Prendergast was the leader, and his money was the motive power.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36417' title='36417'>'"I'd a partner," said he, "a rare good man, as true as a stock to a barrel. </span>
<span sid='36418' title='36418'>He's got the dibbs, he has, and where do you think he is at this moment? </span>
<span sid='36419' title='36419'>Why, he's the chaplain of this ship - the chaplain, no less! </span>
<span sid='36420' title='36420'>He came aboard with a black coat and his papers right, and money enough in his box to buy the thing right from keel to main-truck. </span>
<span sid='36421' title='36421'>The crew are his, body and soul. </span>
<span sid='36422' title='36422'>He could buy 'em at so much a gross with a cash discount, and he did it before ever they signed on. </span>
<span sid='36423' title='36423'>He's got two of the warders and Mercer the second mate, and he'd get the captain himself if he thought him worth it."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36424' title='36424'>'"What are we to do, then?" I asked.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36425' title='36425'>'"What do you think?" said he. </span>
<span sid='36426' title='36426'>"We'll make the coats of some of these soldiers redder than ever the tailor did."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36427' title='36427'>'"But they are armed," said I.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36428' title='36428'>'"And so shall we be, my boy. </span>
<span sid='36429' title='36429'>There's a brace of pistols for every mother's son of us, and if we can't carry this ship, with the crew at our back, it's time we were all sent to a young Miss's boarding school. </span>
<span sid='36430' title='36430'>You speak to your mate on the left to-night, and see if he is to be trusted."</span>
<p>
<span sid='36431' title='36431'>'I did so, and found my other neighbour to be a young fellow in much the same position as myself, whose crime had been forgery. </span>
<span sid='36432' title='36432'>His name was Evans but he afterwards changed it, like myself, and he is now a rich and prosperous man in the South of <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>. </span>
<span sid='36433' title='36433'>He was ready enough to join the conspiracy, as the only means of saving ourselves, and before we had crossed the Bay there were only two of the prisoners who were not in the secret. </span>
<span sid='36434' title='36434'>One of these was of weak mind, and we did not dare to trust him, and the other was suffering from jaundice, and could not be of any use to us.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36435' title='36435'>'From the beginning there was really nothing to prevent us taking possession of the ship. </span>
<span sid='36436' title='36436'>The crew were a set of ruffians, specially picked for the job. </span>
<span sid='36437' title='36437'>The sham chaplain came into our cells to exhort us, carrying a black bag, supposed to be full of tracts, and so often did he come that by the third day we had each stowed away at the foot of our bed a file, a brace of pistols, a pound of powder, and twenty slugs. </span>
<span sid='36438' title='36438'>Two of the warders were agents of Prendergast, and the second mate was his right-hand man. </span>
<span sid='36439' title='36439'>The captain, the two mates, two warders, Lieutenant Martin, his eighteen soldiers, and the doctor were all that we had against us. </span>
<span sid='36440' title='36440'>Yet, safe as it was, we determined to neglect no precaution, and to make our attack suddenly at night. </span>
<span sid='36441' title='36441'>It came, however, more quickly than we expected, and in this way:</span>
<p>
<span sid='36442' title='36442'>'One evening, about the third week after our start, the doctor had come down to see one of the prisoners, who was ill, and, putting his hand down the bottom of his bunk, he felt the outline of the pistols. </span>
<span sid='36443' title='36443'>If he had been silent he might have blown the whole thing, but he was a nervous little chap, so he gave a cry of surprise and turned so pale, that the man knew what was up in an instant and seized him. </span>
<span sid='36444' title='36444'>He was gagged before he could give the alarm, and tied down upon the bed. </span>
<span sid='36445' title='36445'>He had unlocked the door that led to the deck, and we were through it in a rush. </span>
<span sid='36446' title='36446'>The two sentries were shot down, and so was a corporal who came running to see what was the matter. </span>
<span sid='36447' title='36447'>There were two more soldiers at the door of the state-room, and their muskets seemed not to be loaded, for they never fired upon us, and they were shot while trying to fix their bayonets. </span>
<span sid='36448' title='36448'>Then we rushed on into the captain's cabin, but as we pushed open the door there was an explosion from within, and there he lay with his head on the chart of the Atlantic, which was pinned upon the table, while the chaplain stood, with a smoking pistol in his hand, at his elbow. </span>
<span sid='36449' title='36449'>The two mates had both been seized by the crew, and the whole business seemed to be settled.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36450' title='36450'>'The state-room was next the cabin, and we flocked in there and flopped down on the settees, all speaking together, for we were just mad with the feeling that we were free once more. </span>
<span sid='36451' title='36451'>There were lockers all round, and Wilson, the sham chaplain, knocked one of them in, and pulled out a dozen of brown sherry. </span>
<span sid='36452' title='36452'>We cracked off the necks of the bottles, poured the stuff out into tumblers, and were just tossing them off, when in an instant, without warning, there came the roar of muskets in our ears, and the saloon was so full of smoke that we could not see across the table. </span>
<span sid='36453' title='36453'>When it cleared away again the place was a shambles. </span>
<span sid='36454' title='36454'>Wilson and eight others were wriggling on the top of each other on the floor, and the blood and the brown sherry on that table turn me sick now when I think of it. </span>
<span sid='36455' title='36455'>We were so cowed by the sight that I think we should have given the job up if it had not been for Prendergast. </span>
<span sid='36456' title='36456'>He bellowed like a bull and rushed for the door with all that were left alive at his heels. </span>
<span sid='36457' title='36457'>Out we ran, and there on the poop were the lieutenant and ten of his men. </span>
<span sid='36458' title='36458'>The swing skylights above the saloon table had been a bit open, and they had fired on us through the slit. </span>
<span sid='36459' title='36459'>We got on them before they could load, and they stood to it like men, but we had the upper hand of them, and in five minutes it was all over. </span>
<span sid='36460' title='36460'>My God! was there ever a slaughterhouse like that ship? </span>
<span sid='36461' title='36461'>Prendergast was like a raging devil, and he picked the soldiers up as if they had been children and threw them overboard, alive or dead. </span>
<span sid='36462' title='36462'>There was one sergeant that was horribly wounded, and yet kept on swimming for a surprising time, until someone in mercy blew out his brains. </span>
<span sid='36463' title='36463'>When the fighting was over there was no one left of our enemies except just the warders, the mates, and the doctor.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36464' title='36464'>'It was over them that the great quarrel arose. </span>
<span sid='36465' title='36465'>There were many of us who were glad enough to win back our freedom, and yet who had no wish to have murder on our souls. </span>
<span sid='36466' title='36466'>It was one thing to knock the soldiers over with their muskets in their hands, and it was another to stand by while men were being killed in cold blood. </span>
<span sid='36467' title='36467'>Eight of us, five convicts and three sailors, said that we would not see it done. </span>
<span sid='36468' title='36468'>But there was no moving Prendergast and those who were with him. </span>
<span sid='36469' title='36469'>Our only chance of safety lay in making a clean job of it, said he, and he would not leave a tongue with power to wag in a witness-box. </span>
<span sid='36470' title='36470'>It nearly came to our sharing the fate of the prisoners, but at last he said that if we wished we might take a boat and go. </span>
<span sid='36471' title='36471'>We jumped at the offer, for we were already sick of these bloodthirsty doings, and we saw that there would be worse before it was done. </span>
<span sid='36472' title='36472'>We were given a suit of sailors' togs each, a barrel of water, two casks, one of junk and one of biscuits, and a compass. </span>
<span sid='36473' title='36473'>Prendergast threw us over a chart, told us that we were shipwrecked mariners whose ship had foundered in lat. 15° N. and long. 25° W., and then cut the painter and let us go.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36474' title='36474'>'And now I come to the most surprising part of my story, my dear son. </span>
<span sid='36475' title='36475'>The seamen had hauled the foreyard aback during the rising, but now as we left them they brought it square again, and, as there was a light wind from the north and east, the barque began to draw slowly away from us. </span>
<span sid='36476' title='36476'>Our boat lay, rising and falling, upon the long, smooth rollers, and Evans and I, who were the most educated of the party, were sitting in the sheets working out our position and planning what coast we should make for. </span>
<span sid='36477' title='36477'>It was a nice question, for the Cape de Verds was about 500 miles to the north of us, and the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Africa&t=h'>Africa</a>n coast about 700 miles to the east. </span>
<span sid='36478' title='36478'>On the whole, as the wind was coming round to north, we thought that <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sierra Leone&t=h'>Sierra Leone</a> might be best, and turned our head in that direction, the barque being at that time nearly hull down on our starboard quarter. </span>
<span sid='36479' title='36479'>Suddenly as we looked at her we saw a dense black cloud of smoke shoot up from her, which hung like a monstrous tree upon the sky-line. </span>
<span sid='36480' title='36480'>A few seconds later a roar like thunder burst upon our ears, and as the smoke thinned away there was no sign left of the Gloria Scott. </span>
<span sid='36481' title='36481'>In an instant we swept the boat's head round again, and pulled with all our strength for the place where the haze, still trailing over the water, marked the scene of this catastrophe.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36482' title='36482'>'It was a long hour before we reached it, and at first we feared that we had come too late to save anyone. </span>
<span sid='36483' title='36483'>A splintered boat and a number of crates and fragments of spars rising and falling on the waves showed us where the vessel had foundered, but there was no sign of life, and we had turned away in despair when we heard a cry for help, and saw at some distance a piece of wreckage with a man lying stretched across it. </span>
<span sid='36484' title='36484'>When we pulled him aboard the boat he proved to be a young seaman of the name of Hudson, who was so burned and exhausted that he could give us no account of what had happened until the following morning.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36485' title='36485'>'It seemed that, after we had left, Prendergast and his gang had proceeded to put to death the remaining five prisoners: the two warders had been shot and thrown overboard, and so also had the third mate. </span>
<span sid='36486' title='36486'>Prendergast then descended into the 'tween decks, and with his own hands cut the throat of the unfortunate surgeon. </span>
<span sid='36487' title='36487'>There only remained the first mate, who was a bold and active man. </span>
<span sid='36488' title='36488'>When he saw the convict approaching him with the bloody knife in his hand, he kicked off his bonds, which he had somehow contrived to loosen, and rushing down the deck he plunged into the after-hold.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36489' title='36489'>'A dozen convicts who descended with their pistols in search of him found him with a match-box in his hand seated beside an open powder barrel, which was one of a hundred carried on board, and swearing that he would blow all hands up if he were in any way molested. </span>
<span sid='36490' title='36490'>An instant later the explosion occurred, though Hudson thought it was caused by the misdirected bullet of one of the convicts rather than the mate's match. </span>
<span sid='36491' title='36491'>Be the cause what it may, it was the end of the Gloria Scott, and of the rabble who held command of her.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36492' title='36492'>'Such, in a few words, my dear boy, is the history of this terrible business in which I was involved. </span>
<span sid='36493' title='36493'>Next day we were picked up by the brig Hotspur, bound for <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Australia&t=h'>Australia</a>, whose captain found no difficulty in believing that we were the survivors of a passenger ship which had foundered. </span>
<span sid='36494' title='36494'>The transport ship, Gloria Scott, was set down by the Admiralty as being lost at sea, and no word has ever leaked out as to her true fate. </span>
<span sid='36495' title='36495'>After an excellent voyage the Hotspur landed us at <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Sydney&t=h'>Sydney</a>, where Evans and I changed our names and made our way to the diggings, where among the crowds who were gathered from all nations, we had no difficulty in losing our former identities.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36496' title='36496'>'The rest I need not relate. </span>
<span sid='36497' title='36497'>We prospered, we travelled, we came back as rich Colonials to <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=England&t=h'>England</a>, and we bought country estates. </span>
<span sid='36498' title='36498'>For more than twenty years we have led peaceful and useful lives, and we hoped that our past was for ever buried. </span>
<span sid='36499' title='36499'>Imagine, then, my feelings when in the seaman who came to us I recognized instantly the man who had been picked off the wreck! </span>
<span sid='36500' title='36500'>He had tracked us down somehow, and had set himself to live upon our fears. </span>
<span sid='36501' title='36501'>You will understand now how it was that I strove to keep peace with him, and you will in some measure sympathize with me in the fears which fill me, now that he has gone from me to his other victim with threats upon his tongue.</span>
<p>
<span sid='36502' title='36502'>'Underneath is written, in a hand so shaky as to be hardly legible, "Beddoes writes in cipher to say that H. has told all. </span>
<span sid='36503' title='36503'>Sweet Lord, have mercy on our souls!"</span>
<p>
<span sid='36504' title='36504'>'That was the narrative which I read that night to young Trevor, and I think, Watson, that under the circumstances it was a dramatic one. </span>
<span sid='36505' title='36505'>The good fellow was heartbroken at it, and went out to the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Terai&t=h'>Terai</a> tea planting, where I hear that he is doing well. </span>
<span sid='36506' title='36506'>As to the sailor and Beddoes, neither of them was ever heard of again after that day on which the letter of warning was written. </span>
<span sid='36507' title='36507'>They both disappeared utterly and completely. </span>
<span sid='36508' title='36508'>No complaint had been lodged with the police, so that Beddoes had mistaken a threat for a deed. </span>
<span sid='36509' title='36509'>Hudson had been seen lurking about, and it was believed by the police that he had done away with Beddoes, and had fled. </span>
<span sid='36510' title='36510'>For myself, I believe that the truth was exactly the opposite. </span>
<span sid='36511' title='36511'>I think it is most probable that Beddoes, pushed to desperation, and believing himself to have been already betrayed, had revenged himself upon Hudson, and had fled from the country with as much money as he could lay his hands on. </span>
<span sid='36512' title='36512'>Those are the facts of the case, Doctor, and if they are of any use to your collection, I am sure that they are very heartily at your service.'</span>
